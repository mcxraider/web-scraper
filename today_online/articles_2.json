            "Article Summary": "For the attempted rape of his step-daughter, a 41-year-old man was sentenced to jail and caning.\nHe also molested the girl in the bedroom where his other young children were present.\nThe victim was aged 11 to 14 during the period when these happened",
            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — A 41-year-old man was sentenced to six years and seven months’ jail and eight strokes of the cane on Wednesday (May 29) for the attempted rape and molestation of his step-daughter, then aged 11 or 12.\nThe man pleaded guilty to aggravated attempted rape of a person aged under 14, as well as outrage of modesty.\nBoth the offender and his victim cannot be named due to a court order to protect the victim’s identity.\nThe man's sentence was backdated to his date of arrest on May 18 last year.\nCourt documents showed that the man had been in a romantic relationship with the victim’s biological mother since 2004, and later moved in together with them and lived as a family.\nThe victim, who was between five and six years old then, treated the man like a father figure.\nThey moved houses multiple times over the years — in 2010, they moved in with the man’s parents in the Chua Chu Kang district and later moved to a rented bedroom of a flat in Geylang in 2013.\nThe man and the victim’s mother registered their marriage in 2015.\nThey have four other children born between 2005 and 2013.\nSometime between 2010 and 2011 at about 2am to 3am, when the rest of the family was asleep in the living room of their home, the man woke up the victim and took her to the kitchen toilet.\nHe did so knowing that the victim, who was aged between 11 and 12 at the time, was quiet in nature and would follow his instructions.\nThe man tried to have sex with her but failed to do so after multiple attempts. He then sexually abused her.\nIn September 2013, when the victim was 14 years old, the man struck again to molest her when they were in the bedroom.\nMost of the victim's step-siblings were watching television in the same room when it happened.\nThe victim’s mother was not there.\nIn April 2014, when the man was sent to jail for separate offences, the girl realised that the sexual acts committed by him were wrong and confided to her mother about what had happened.\nCourt documents did not specify the nature of the offences for which the man was jailed at this time.\nThe girl later ran away from home and said that she was too scared to go home because the man would soon be released from prison, court documents stated.\nThe victim’s mother filed a police report in May last year, on the advice of a social worker.\nThe man was arrested the same month.\nOn Wednesday, Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Daphne Lim sought a jail sentence of between seven years, three months and seven years, five months — together with nine strokes of the cane.\nShe told the court that the man had abused the trust and authority of being a father-figure to the victim and sexually exploited the victim.\n“The man had also brazenly molested the victim in the presence of his other young children, at her home, where she should have been the safest,” DPP Lim added.\nIn mitigation, defence counsel Michelle Tang from law firm Nakoorsha Law said that the man had pleaded guilty early, sparing the victim from more suffering of testifying in court if the case had gone to trial.\nMs Tang also said that the victim had since forgiven the man for what he did.\nDistrict Judge Koo Zhi Xuan said that the sentence imposed was proportionate to the man’s criminality.\n“It is a reminder that we live in a society that cannot tolerate any form of abuse against young and vulnerable victims, especially from someone they trust.”\nFor the attempted rape of a person under the age of 14, the man could have been jailed for between eight and 20 years and received at least 12 strokes of the cane.\nFor outrage of modesty, he could have been jailed for up to three years, fined, caned or been given any combination of such punishments."

            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — A man who set off a box containing 25 shots of fireworks near a block of flats in Yishun last month was ordered to pay a S$5,000 fine on Tuesday (May 28).\nNoor Azhar Abdul Abas, 40, pleaded guilty to discharging dangerous fireworks.\nThe incident took place at a grass patch near Block 644 Yishun Street 61 on April 9, the eve of Hari Raya Puasa, at about 10.40pm.\nAn eight-second clip of the incident posted by a resident was published on video-sharing platform TikTok, which showed the fireworks going off in the housing estate. The video has since been removed. \nNo injuries were reported.\nThe court heard that in March this year, Noor Azhar bought a box of containing 25 tubes of fireworks labelled “Happy Boom Shoot” from an unknown person in the Geylang area. \nHe planned to use them during the Hari Raya Puasa celebrations the following month.\nOn the eve of Hari Raya Puasa, he discharged the fireworks at the grass patch in Yishun, with the fireworks hitting about 10-storeys high and lasting for about two minutes. Court documents did not state if this grass patch was near Noor Azhar's home.\nDue to the commotion and spectacle caused by the discharge of the fireworks, members of the public became alarmed and called the police, who managed to trace Noor Azhar through surveillance cameras in the area.\nThe remains of the fireworks were then seized for analysis.\nTwo video clips of what happened around the Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats were played in court.\nOn Tuesday, Deputy Public Prosecutor Norman Yew sought a S$5,000 fine as punishment. He told the court that Noor Azhar’s actions had caused unnecessary alarm to residents, adding that there was an element of premeditation.\nDuring his mitigation plea, Noor Azhar said that he was deeply remorseful for his actions, which was “carried out without thinking”.\nUnder the Dangerous Fireworks Act, it is an offence to possess, sell, transport, deliver, distribute, import or discharge any dangerous fireworks in Singapore.\nFor his offence, Noor Azhar could have been jailed for up to two years or fined between S$2,000 and S$10,000, or both."

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — The State Coroner has reiterated the importance of safe sleeping practices for infants while giving an open verdict into the death of a seven-week-old boy who was found face down on a pillow.\nWhile State Coroner Adam Nakhoda said it could not be conclusively determined if the baby died from asphyxia or a natural cause of death, he emphasised the importance of safe sleeping arrangements.\nAn expert had previously highlighted that accidental suffocation of a sleeping infant was a preventable cause of sleep-related infant deaths.\nGuidelines include: Not placing loose items like pillows, blankets, beddings, toys or mattresses around or under a sleeping infant; allowing the infant to sleep alone in a baby cot; and using a firm mattress with a fitted bedsheet with no gaps between the mattress and cot rail.\nInfants should be placed on their backs when sleeping and not on their stomach or side until they are a year old. However, babies above four months old who can roll from their backs to their stomachs and back again can be allowed to remain in the sleeping positions they assume.\nThe baby boy was born on May 17, 2023, at KKH Women's and Children's Hospital to a couple who already had a five-year-old daughter and a one-year-old son.\nThe boy was pre-term at 35 weeks due to placental abruption. He weighed only 2.14kg and was transferred to the special care nursery and later neonatal intensive care unit.\nHe was discharged from KKH at two weeks of age.\nHis mother said he may have caught a cough from his brother in the week he went home but had no fever.\nThe baby was cared for primarily by his mother and was bottle-fed every two to three hours.\nInitially, the baby slept in a cot in the same room as his mother and older brother, who was a one-year-old toddler.\nHowever, as the baby woke up frequently to feed, this affected his brother's sleep.\nThe baby was then moved to sleep in another bedroom with his father. In this bedroom, there was an elevated bed and a mattress next to it on the floor.\nThe baby was first put to sleep on the bed, while his father slept on the mattress.\nHowever, the parents became concerned that the baby might fall off the bed and put him to sleep on the mattress instead, while his father slept on the bed.\nWhen the baby slept on the mattress, he was usually placed slightly on his side, with most of his back still on the mattress.\nHis head would be placed on a small pillow in a side-lying position, because milk tended to leak out of his mouth.\nHis head was tilted to the side because of his slight runny nose and congestion.\nThe parents would then cover the baby with a weighted bean bag to prevent him from moving while he slept.\nOn Jul 3, 2023 at about 10pm, the boy's father fed him milk and placed him in his usual sleeping position on the mattress. The baby was likely to be swaddled, the court heard.\nThe father then went to sleep on the bed next to the baby.\nAt about 5.30am the next morning, the father woke up and panicked when he realised the time.\nThis was because the baby should have woken at around 1am to feed, but he had not.\nThe father checked on the baby and saw him face down on the pillow, unresponsive. The weighted bean bag was still on the baby.\nThe father picked the infant up and tried to wake him but found that he was stiff and cold.\nThe man then woke his wife, who saw that the baby's face and lips were purplish.\nShe was trained in infant first aid and began to administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation to the baby while her husband called for an ambulance.\nParamedics at the scene estimated that the baby had likely died for some time. The child was pronounced dead later that morning.\nAn autopsy could not ascertain the final cause of death. Although asphyxia could not be totally excluded as a cause of death, it was also possible that the boy had died due to a natural disease process, the medical officer performing the autopsy found.\nPhotos taken of the scene showed that the mattress the baby slept on was a thin adult-sized mattress that appeared to be meant for a single bed.\nWhile a fitted sheet was placed on the mattress, it was clear it did not fit snugly as there were creases and ridges made by the loosely fitted sheet, the coroner said.\nThe mattress was placed against the elevated bed, with soft toys, small pillows and a packet of wet wipes placed on the mattress.\nThe pillow was rectangular with a depression in the middle, possibly caused by the weight of the baby's head.\nThe parents of the child did not raise any issues or concerns during the coroner's inquiry and the police did not suspect foul play.\nThe coroner said \"losing a child is always a devastating event, perhaps more so when the child is a very young infant that was otherwise thriving\".\nAlthough the boy had some medical issues at birth, he had overcome these and there was no evidence he had any other issues at the time of his death.\nThe coroner found that it was likely the baby had died before 5.30am when his father found him.\nWhile it was unclear how the baby ended up lying prone, it was possible that his nose and mouth were covered by the pillow, resulting in asphyxiation.\nThis could have resulted in the redness seen around the baby's nose and mouth and a small bruise on his nose. However, the coroner said these could also have been a result of the CPR.\nHe extended his condolences to the boy's parents on their tragic loss. CNA\nFor more reports like this, visit cna.asia."

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — A veteran doctor has been suspended for a year by the Singapore Medical Council (SMC) for professional misconduct, after a misdiagnosis in 2019 resulted in a teenage patient losing his testicle.\nDr Yeo Khee Hong, who has been a registered medical practitioner for about 42 years, first diagnosed the teenager with abdominal colic and later swelling and inflammation in his testicles, prescribing him stomach-related medicine and antibiotics.\nHowever, the boy's condition worsened despite repeated visits to Dr Yeo, until he had to undergo surgery to remove his testicle. His real condition was testicular torsion — a condition where the spermatic cord which provides blood flow to the testicle becomes twisted and cuts off blood supply.\nIf the boy had been referred for urgent care in time, he had an estimated 90.4 per cent to 97.2 per cent chance of salvaging his testis, according to the grounds of decision on the case, released on Monday (May 27).\nDr Yeo pleaded guilty to one charge of professional misconduct for failing to provide competent and appropriate care and or to exercise due care in the management of his patient.\nA second charge of failing to provide adequate information to the patient was taken into consideration for sentencing.\nThe boy was 15 or 16 when he consulted Dr Yeo at his clinic on March 22, 2019.\nHe told Dr Yeo that he felt pain in his left abdomen that had started from his left testis.\nHe also had increased bowel movement, with watery stools.\nDr Yeo examined the boy and found that his abdomen was soft and that there was no abnormal mass or torsion in his left testis.\nHe diagnosed the boy with abdominal colic and prescribed him stomach-related medicine.\nFive days later, the boy consulted Dr Yeo again and said he had swelling and pain in his left testis which felt worse when he sat or walked.\nDr Yeo examined the boy, finding his left testis enlarged and tender.\nHe diagnosed the boy with orchitis and epididymitis — swelling and inflammation — of the left testis. He prescribed antibiotics to the boy and ordered a full blood count and urine test for him to confirm his diagnosis.\nHowever, before arriving at his diagnosis, Dr Yeo did not consider the possibility of intermittent testicular torsion.\nHe excluded this and considered that orchitis and epididymitis was more probable. \nDr Yeo also did not refer the boy to a specialist or to the accident & emergency department of a hospital before excluding testicular torsion.\nThe next day, Dr Yeo told the boy's mother about the result of the blood test and said the likely cause of swelling was an infection. He asked that the boy continue his prescription of antibiotics.\nThe boy's condition did not improve. His father called Dr Yeo on April 1, 2019 saying his son was suffering severe pain.\nDr Yeo said the boy's condition was serious and asked him to be taken to an accident & emergency department urgently.\nThe boy went to a hospital where a scrotal ultrasound revealed left testicular torsion. \nHe was admitted to a surgical ward and underwent surgery to remove his left testis.\nThe SMC heard that a \"reasonable and competent doctor\" in Dr Yeo's position would have considered the possibility of intermittent testicular torsion at the consultation on March 27, 2019, and would not have excluded it as a differential diagnosis without first referring the patient to a specialist or an accident & emergency department of a hospital.\nThe applicable standard of care is to consider all acute scrotal pain as testicular torsion until proven otherwise.\nThe boy's father made a complaint to the SMC around July 2020, alleging that Dr Yeo was negligent in failing to diagnose and eliminate the risk of testicular torsion, resulting in the removal of his son's left testicle.\nDr Yeo responded to the SMC's notice of complaint and later sent an apology letter to the patient and his family.\nAccording to the grounds of decision, the patient's likely early testicular salvage rate would have been an estimated 90.4 per cent to 97.2 per cent if Dr Yeo had referred him to a specialist or the accident & emergency department of a hospital during the consultation on March 27, 2019.\nCounsel for the SMC, Mr Chia Voon Jiet, Ms Lee I-Lin and Ms Chin Dan Ting from Drew & Napier, said Dr Yeo's misconduct delayed the patient's diagnosis and treatment such that he lost a significant chance of salvaging his left testis.\nThe boy suffered not only physical pain but emotional and psychological distress from the loss. \nThe potential harm to the boy also includes fertility issues from losing a testis, said SMC's lawyers.\nDr Yeo, who was represented by Mr Christopher Chong and Ms Sharon Liu from Dentons Rodyk & Davidson, said he was \"deeply saddened\" by the patient's plight.\nHe accepted that he ought to be penalised for not referring the boy to an accident & emergency department on March 27, 2019.\nHowever, he said an urgent referral would not have guaranteed that the testis would be salvaged.\nCounsel for the SMC argued that Dr Yeo had acted negligently and that his treatment of the patient was not an appropriate management option.\n\"Despite the patient being at risk of testicular torsion and his clinical presentation and age being suggestive of testicular torsion, (Dr Yeo) was content to treat the patient with antibiotics, perform laboratory investigations, and to 'make the decision to refer only if the pain and swelling persisted in a few days and depending on the full blood count test results',\" said the lawyers.\nIn response, Dr Yeo said he had considered the possibility of testicular torsion, but his preferred preliminary diagnosis was orchitis and epididymitis in view of his physical examination of the patient.\nDr Yeo said his failure to inform the boy of the possibility of testicular torsion was \"a wrong judgment call\", but said it was \"out of good intention as he did not want to cause undue alarm to the patient\".\nHe accepted lapses on his part but said he had the boy's well-being and best interests in his mind, with no suggestion he was acting maliciously or recklessly.\nOn top of the 12-month suspension, Dr Yeo will also be censured. He will have to submit a written undertaking to the SMC that he will not engage in the conduct again or any similar conduct, and he will have to pay the costs and expenses of the proceedings including the costs incurred by SMC's lawyers.

            "Article Body": "KUALA LUMPUR — Malaysia will require all foreign-registered vehicles entering the country by land from Singapore to use vehicle entry permits (VEPs) from Oct 1, said Malaysian Transport Minister Anthony Loke.  \nAction will be taken against any foreign motor vehicle without a VEP entering or in Malaysia from that date, he said at a press conference on Tuesday (May 28).\nAnyone found guilty of the offence can be fined up to RM2,000 (S$570) or jailed for up to six months.\nVehicles that have been registered will be fitted with a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag that costs RM10.\nMr Loke added the VEP has been implemented since 2019 but has not been enforced. The system was put on hold in 2020 as the government said it was looking at ways to make installation of the RFID tag easier. \nBased on current records, Mr Loke said there are about 70,000 Singapore-registered motor vehicles that have activated VEP tags. More than 200,000 motor vehicles have been registered but have not completed the process of installing and activating their VEP tags.\nThe RFID tags, which uniquely identify each vehicle, are non-transferrable.  \nMr Loke said the tags will be sent to vehicle owners for installation. “If previously, they had to come to Johor Bahru to get it fixed … now it will be sent to their address and they can fix it themselves according to the guidelines provided,” he said.\n“The system is ready and the registration commenced in 2019 but we had not enforced it for five years. If we don’t enforce it, the system is not being utilised,” he added.\nThe VEP will enable the government to track foreign vehicles that enter or leave the country, he said. “When they leave, if they have any summonses, they will have to settle them before they are allowed to leave.”\nCurrently, all foreign-registered cars entering Malaysia by road via Johor need to pay a levy.\nSingapore-registered vehicles are required to pay a road charge of RM20 for entering via the Woodlands Causeway and Tuas Second Link checkpoints, which are among the busiest in the world.\nMotorcycles are excluded from these charges. \nDuring the same press conference, Mr Loke said that the government intends to expand the VEP and Road Charge system to the Malaysia-Thailand border. \nMore information about the VEP can be accessed at vep.jpj.gov.my.

            "Article Summary": "It is normal to procrastinate when we are faced with a boring or difficult task.\nAs each person has different preferences and habits, anti-procrastination methods may not work the same way for everyone.\nExperts said that it is important to recognise \"how\" and \"why\" one procrastinates and tailor the method to the individual .\nTODAY tries three different anti-procrastination methods to see which one works best",
            "Article Body": "Increasingly, people are becoming aware of the importance of mental health and well-being in our lives. In our weekly Gen Zen series, TODAY looks at ways that we can feel better while coping with the mental stresses of modern life.\nSINGAPORE — As someone who struggles to stay focused, anytime I set out to finish a task, it often looks like this: I put down my cup of coffee, turn on my computer, and then end up scrolling on my phone for the next 20 minutes.\nThen in an effort to make my day more productive, I start rearranging my room or doing other things, except what I had set out to do.\nThen surprise! The panic over the deadline sets in and I get a boost of productivity at night. \nSuddenly, my work is completed, and I finally go to sleep at 7am.\nThere lies the problem: In rushing to meet my deadline, I have sacrificed sleep, proper meals and even a daily shower.\nThe accumulation of insufficient sleep and poor nutrition often led to me crashing after each deadline. \nIt also left me feeling too tired to socialise and I end up losing precious time with family and friends.\nI know precisely the problem: I procrastinate too much. So how should I regain my balance and manage this better?\nMental health experts I consulted said that there are broadly four reasons people procrastinate: Boredom, low self-confidence, a lack of competence and stress. \nFinding a task boring, or being overwhelmed by the complexity of the task, can cause one to stall for time. \nNot having the skills to tackle the assignment or feeling the pressure to finish it can also lead to procrastination.\nThen there are other things that people deem as important, but which can be a source of distraction.\nDr Joel Yang, a clinical psychologist at Mind What Matters psychological consultancy firm, said: “Tidying up your room or checking your emails are important. Socialising and having a nap can contribute positively to your mental health. \n“These may not seem like procrastination, but any task can (cause procrastination) when it is one that we use to distract ourselves from our task or goal.”\nExperts said that it is normal to procrastinate, that it is okay to take breaks while on a task.\nMs Amelia Mak from Heartscape Psychology clinic said: “Our limited attention span makes focusing on a task for long periods of time challenging.”\nProcrastination can even enhance productivity when the deadline draws nearer or when there is heightened concentration, Dr Yang said. \nHowever, it becomes an obstacle when excessive procrastination leads to missed deadlines or must-do assignments remain incomplete. \nAt its most extreme, people start to “deny things are important to them” such as school or work, Dr Yang added.\nProcrastination becomes more than just being unproductive when it harms one’s well-being or their relationships with others. \nNegative effects can also come in the form of insufficient sleep, heightened stress and anxiety as deadlines approach and no progress has been made. \nThe key in regulating procrastination is self-awareness, the experts said.\nUnderstanding “how” and “why” one is procrastinating can help with managing the emotions that come with a task. \n“It is important to set aside periodic breaks from tasks so it is intentional and not merely to procrastinate,” Dr Yang said.\nMs Mak advised: “Be reflective on your own procrastination habits and understand these triggers or any patterns to specific tasks.”\nThis means that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to procrastination, but it should instead be adapted to individual preferences and habits.\nI have tried several ways to deal with my habit of procrastinating: Using the timer application Pomodoro, turning to Study-With-Me videos and putting my phone aside.\nIn the end, I had found them ineffective after a while and, after speaking with the experts, I now know why.\nSo, I decided to give the three methods another try, timing how long it took me to write a 500-word article with each of these methods.\nOnly this time, I tailored them to my individual routines.\nPomodoro is a timer app that breaks up work into intervals of 25 minutes followed by a short break. \nIt helps arrange time to provide intentional breaks for people to refresh themselves between study sessions.\nMs Mak advised that the time intervals should be fitted within the individual’s threshold of attention.\nSo I tried a 35-minute focused session with a five-minute rest, which suits me as I reached the break just as my focus was running out. \nI was able to finish my task in two hours and 23 minutes.\nHowever, having my phone beside me as a timer made it difficult to resist using my phone. \nAs time dragged on, my attention span waned and the 35 minutes started to feel too long. \nStudy-With-Me videos are made by creators who film themselves studying while inviting others to join them.\nHaving environmental cues can help in facilitating focus and create a sense of belonging with the shared struggle of having to get work done. \nUsing this method, I completed the task in the shortest time: One hour and 18 minutes. \nWatching live comments of how others were also struggling with their work helped reduce the stress that I felt from doing the task.\nBeing able to interact with others in the comments also helped me deal with boredom. \nThe only downside was the occasional advertisement that popped up.  \nPhones can be a major distraction so I tried putting it out of my reach until I completed the task. \nThis was more effective than Pomodoro and it took me one hour and 29 minutes to finish the task. \nI was able to resist the impulse to check my phone whenever I felt stressed and took a walk around my house when I was tired. \nHowever, this method is not always feasible for me since there are times where I need my phone for work.\nWhile I found the most success with the Study-With-Me videos, experts said that one can try out different methods and adjust them accordingly.\n“Most importantly, allow for self-compassion and acknowledge that setbacks may occur in trying to kick the habit of procrastination,” Ms Mak said.\nAlthough these solutions don’t guarantee that I will always be productive, it has reduced the amount of time I spend on a task and allowed me to reconnect with my family and friends."

            "Article Summary": "Four-year-old Atlas Wong is travelling the world with his parents for two years instead of attending preschool.\nBefore he was born, his parents had made a promise to each other to take their firstborn on worldly adventures.\nTo afford this journey, they saved money for five years, living frugally and prioritising experiences over material possessions.\nSince they started travelling on Jan 17, the family has visited more than 20 countries.\nThey plan to continue travelling to more destinations until Atlas turns six, believing that this is a valuable educational experience for him",
            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — Instead of attending preschool like other children his age, four-year-old Atlas Wong, who was named after his parents' passion for travel, is doing his learning while flying across the globe.\nOver the last four months, he has travelled to 22 countries including Belgium, France, Greece and Turkiye. His jet-setting life will continue until he is six, with destinations such as Canada, Japan and the United States still to come.\n\nHis parents, civil servants Rakcent Wong, 35, and Carol Tan, 36, came up with the 50-country list after they promised each other that they would take their child on \"worldly adventures\" before he started formal school.\nMr Wong, who like his wife is on a two-year sabbatical from his job, said: \"Atlas means a bundle of maps. Since we already planned to travel around the world, we thought this would be an appropriate name (for him).\" \nBefore Atlas was born, Mr Wong and his wife frequently embarked on short trips overseas. With every trip, the couple said that they learned more about themselves and the cultures in the places they visited.  \nHe added: “Travelling has such a strong transformative power, and we want to gift it to our child despite people telling us that we should stop travelling after having a kid.” \nWhen I first heard about their two-year sojourn after chancing upon their joint Instagram account Engaging Atlas, I was in awe. The idea of taking time off from work and life to travel seemed so out of reach for an average working adult.  \nYet here they were, somehow managing to \"live the dream\" with their young son, determined to show him places I might not get to visit in my lifetime. \nApart from myself, more than 11,500 followers eagerly tune in to get a glimpse of their adventures through the account, meticulously curated by Atlas' parents.\nEvery day, the couple sets out with their phone camera, capturing various sights, sounds and experiences.\nEach video is marked with a country flag and the day of their travel so that viewers may easily track when and where the family has been.\nThat was why when I arranged to meet them online on a FaceTime video-call, I had a question that I was dying to ask: How in the world are they able to do all this?\nTo my question, Ms Tan said that their two-year trip is being funded from their savings, which they accumulated from living frugally for five years from the time before Atlas was born. \n“We set this five-year target because we thought Atlas should be more independent by then.\n“He should be able to eat on his own and walk a bit further, and when we come back, it would be just in time for primary school. So we felt this was the right time,” Mr Wong said.\nThe family was in Cyprus at the time when we spoke. This week, they are in Nepal.\nAfter doing their sums, the couple calculated that the trip would cost them an average of S$150 a day, inclusive of the cost of flight tickets.\nMr Wong admitted that it was tough at the start because he had to really scrutinise his wife’s finances.\n“She appreciates the finer things in life,” he said with a laugh. \nMs Tan said that before they made this decision to travel for an extended period of time, she led a more indulgent lifestyle and had no qualms about splurging on cafe food and branded bags every now and then. \n“After that, I realised I wasn’t truly happy even when I spent on these items. Travelling, however, gave me a different perspective on life. So I changed my mindset to focus on valuable experiences instead of materials, and I managed to save up for our financial goal of travelling,” she added.  \nThe couple do not own a car and have been living in a four-room Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat since 2016, before Atlas was born.\n\nThey mostly ate cheap hawker food and relied on public transport to get around, and made it a point to take the cheapest flights available over the course of their two-year journey. \nEven with such decisions, it was a trade-off that was unpalatable to some, the couple told me.\n“Our parents were very supportive because they knew how free-spirited and adventurous we are. But our friends, especially our colleagues, told us we should stop our adventures now that we have a kid,\" Ms Tan said. \nThese comments did not deter the couple but spurred them instead to push ahead with their plans, even if it meant forgoing income and the ability for Atlas' grandparents to see him in person for two years.  \nTheir journey started on Jan 17 when they left Singapore for Greece. The couple decided that this would be their first location for practical reasons — they managed to snag cheap flight tickets for about S$300 a person. \nThere, they visited the black sand beach in the island of Santorini, where the sand is made of volcanic material and lava fragments, and witnessed the sunset at the picturesque village of Oia.\nSince then, they have visited more than 20 places in Europe, including Montenegro, Bosnia, Croatia, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland. \nThese were places that I had only read about or seen on television, but never in real life.\nTruth be told, I was more amazed than envious, because it wasn't that I couldn't afford to travel to these dreamy locales, but it was just an unimaginable thought that I would have to set aside my commitments to be abroad.\nAlso, for a start, travelling to all these places with a young child in tow sounded tiring.\nHowever, as Mr Wong and Ms Tan regaled me with tales of their epic travels, it was hard to tell that they were suffering from any travel fatigue.\nRight before our FaceTime session at 1pm Singapore time, the pair told me that they had not slept in 24 hours. \nThe couple had just reached Cyprus — it was 8am over there — after braving a red-eye (overnight) flight from Turkiye the night before. \nYet, to my eyes, I could hardly detect any homesickness or exhaustion, as the couple excitedly shared how their next steps would take them to Nepal, where they plan to stay for a month to maximise their travel visa validity period there.\nAs to exactly where they will be, Mr Wong said that they have no concrete itinerary or plan in place, except that they have to be in Kenya by July because that is the best time for a safari visit.\nAt this point, I thought about how the longest I've been away from home for travels was two weeks. I cannot fathom ever needing to extend a trip just so I could get the most out of my travel visa.\nAfter all, I am not someone who can live without Asian cuisine for more than two days.\nMr Wong and Ms Tan said that coping with the lack of Singapore food was one of the hardest moments they had to experience during their global adventure. Two weeks after departing Singapore, Atlas asked for char siew (barbecued pork) rice.\n“Char siew rice was his comfort food because we would have it once every three to four days. It was so easy to 'dabao' (Chinese for take-away) when the stall was just downstairs,\" Ms Tan said, recalling that this happened while they were in North Macedonia. \n“I felt so bad because I couldn’t find char siew rice for him. His diet was my biggest concern.”\nRefusing to be defeated by this, she then sought to level up her cooking skills in order to whip up Singapore meals for Atlas and her husband whenever they wanted a taste of home. \nTo the couple, the most challenging part of their journey was not related to finances, pausing their careers or navigating new places. Rather, it was having to be a good parent to Atlas while coping with travel anxieties.\n\"Parenting is always a challenge,\" Mr Wong said. \"Balancing it with travel and other responsibilities adds an extra layer of difficulty, especially when we're on our own out here.\"\nHe and his wife admitted that the journey so far has not been all butterflies and rainbows. \"But we embraced the journey as a family, knowing it would be the most rewarding part,\" Mr Wong added.\nAt the end of the day, the trip is not meant for the couple to indulge themselves, they said. It was conceived from the start to give Atlas an enriching adventure.\nTo this, Mr Wong recalled how, in Lyon, France, their son saw the exposed mechanism of a cable car and decided to pepper his parents with questions about it.\nFar from being put off, Mr Wong said that hearing the boy's questions put to rest any doubts that they had when they first decided to embark on their journey.\n“Atlas stood there and watched cable cars go up and down for a good 10 minutes. He asked specific questions like, ‘How does this work? Why is it like this?’ \n“We thought this would be a good skill that he could use further in life because when you learn things, you need to know the reasons why. And when you’re curious, that’s when your knowledge will expand,” Ms Tan said. \nAsked if she was worried about how Atlas may fit into Singapore's primary school system when he reaches six, Ms Tan admitted that her son might not be \"used to sitting down\".\n“But with this sense of wonder he has shown throughout the trip, I’m sure he will become an effective learner when he’s older,” she said.  \nI wish I could've seen Atlas on camera, but he was sound asleep at their lodging in Cyprus given that their red-eye flight was just hours before.\nI couldn't help thinking how it was so good that he has parents who believed that life lessons are best learned through exploration and exposure, and who were willing to pause their own lives to grant him a memorable childhood.\nIt should go without saying that such a sojourn may not be for everyone, but a little part of me wonders if I would have had a different worldview had I gone on such a trip at Atlas' age. \nAs the famed American zoologist Jack Hanna once said: \"The world is the true classroom. The most rewarding and important type of learning is through experience, seeing something with our own eyes.\""

            "Article Summary": "Amid the increasing awareness of mental health, meditation apps have proliferated to help people find some zen.\nThese apps offer valuable tools for reducing stress and anxiety, improving focus and enhancing sleep quality.\nTODAY tested out five popular options to compare their prices and offerings .\nWhile each has its strengths, some are more suited to beginners and some to more seasoned practitioners",
            "Article Body": "Increasingly, people are becoming aware of the importance of mental health and well-being in our lives. In our weekly Gen Zen series, TODAY looks at ways that we can feel better while coping with the mental stresses of modern life.\n\nSINGAPORE — Most of us can agree that stress is a constant in this modern life, and we are also increasingly aware that taking a moment to pause and check in on ourselves is important to our mental health.\nTo those seeking calm amid our endlessly busy lives, meditation is often offered up as a way to ground ourselves. Studies have also shown the benefits of meditation in reducing stress and anxiety, increasing focus and boosting sleep. \nNo surprise then, that a gamut of meditation apps have flooded the app market to provide everyone from meditation novices to seasoned practitioners with convenient ways to zen out.\nIt can be intimidating to get started when there is so much information out there and so many options to choose from. \nAnd so I decided to try out some of the most popular meditation and wellness apps out there to find out which may be best for different segments of the population. \nI measured the apps based their cost, features, intuitiveness and overall experience. \nAfter a week of meditating and hearing soothing voices asking me to close my eyes and focus on my breath, I’ve concluded that finding the right meditation app is a personal journey.\nWhether you prefer an evidence-based approach or more gentle, mindful ways to move, there is an app that understands and caters to your needs.  \nOne of the most well-known apps on the market, Headspace caters to all levels, with introductory courses all the way to more advanced sessions for long-time meditators.  \nThe app offers various structured courses that require users to spend a maximum of 10 minutes a day, from learning the basics of meditation to more targeted courses dealing with issues such as work stress and anxiety.\nIf courses are too much of a commitment, there are also emotion-based single sessions, such as a 10-minute guided meditation for when you are feeling frustrated or gearing up for a difficult conversation.\nHeadspace also offers Sleepcasts, soothing audio to help users fall asleep, as well as animated videos that explain meditation techniques in an engaging way.\nThe app's Mindful Workouts series combines physical exercises and dance with mindfulness practices. For example, their Mindful Cardio series makes running or jogging an intentional and mindful exercise. During the 10-minute run, the coach guides you to check in with your body and notice your surroundings.\nI enjoyed being especially present during the exercise and aware of both my mind and body working together. I left the short session feeling energised and my mind also felt more alert.\nMy experience with Headspace was a breeze. The app's intuitive design and vast library of content made my meditation journey a delightful exploration. \nCost: 14-day free trial, S$17.98 per month, S$138.98 annual subscription\n10 Percent Happier is designed for people who may be skeptical of meditation and want to learn the science behind it, or those who prefer a more practical approach to the practice.\nThe app offers videos that break down the psychology behind feelings such as stress, anxiety and phobias, and offer guided meditation sessions related to each video. \nThese in-depth mindfulness and mental health courses are led by experienced meditation experts, including authors of mindfulness books and academics who teach mindfulness courses at universities.\nThe app also has videos of interviews and talks with meditation experts for those who want to understand the nuts and bolts of the practice.\nPersonally, I found 10 Percent Happier’s courses helpful in learning about meditation from those in the field. I like that there is a short and engaging video that preps you before each meditation session.\nTheir single meditation session also covers a variety of topics taught by different experts, something I quite enjoyed.\nFor single meditation sessions, users can choose the length of the session, which can be as short as 5 minutes or as long as 45 minutes. \nCost: Seven-day free trial, S$19.98 per month, S$138.98 annual subscription\nAnother well-known meditation app, Calm, features guided meditations focusing on stress management, anxiety, and sleep.\nLike Headspace, Calm offers content such as soundscapes, sleep stories and guided breathwork and meditation sessions.\nA defining feature of Calm is the Daily Calm session. Each day the app offers up a 10-minute meditation session that is weaved together with a story.\nThe app has also started offering mindful stretching and light exercise guides called the Daily Move, nuggets of wisdom titled the Daily Jay, and a more fun meditation to start your day with the Daily Trip. \nA unique feature of Calm's Sleep Stories is that they are sometimes narrated by famous personalities.\nI found the Sleep Stories read by Harry Styles and Cillian Murphy especially soothing, while Lebron James's session on training your mind is a masterclass in focus and how to build mental strength.\nThe strength of Calm is its collaboration with actors and singers to add a mindful slant to content you might be familiar with. For example, the app has an hour-long track by American singer-songwriter JVKE entitled \"This Is What Sleep Sounds Like\", a riff on his album track titles. \nCost: Seven-day free trial, S$78.98 annual subscription, S$599,98 one-time lifetime subscription\nDown Dog is a fitness app that includes meditation and breathwork exercises.\nYou can tailor your meditation sessions by choosing the length, focus and background sounds to suit your preferences. \nThe app integrates seamlessly with Down Dog’s other fitness apps, which offer guided yoga, HIIT and barre exercises. A subscription to Down Dog gives you access to all of these apps.\nDown Dog is probably more well-suited to people who are already familiar with meditation and want to be able to jump into a session without any extra videos or frills to sit through.\nCost: Seven-day free trial, S$14.48 monthly subscription, S$88.98 yearly subscription \nInsight Timer is an app with an extensive library of guided sessions and a strong community approach.\nThe app includes a customisable meditation timer with ambient sounds, structured courses and workshops, and a strong community aspect, allowing users to connect with others and join interest-based groups. \nMeditation should not have to cost an arm and a leg and Insight Timer is one of the few apps that offers a free version that allows users access to more than 146,000 guided meditations, talks, podcasts, and music tracks.\nThe free version does not include access to the app's courses, offline listening, or the ability to rewind or fast-forward. \nI was impressed by the variety of guides available on the app —in addition to the usual courses on issues such as stress and anxiety, boundaries and productivity, the app even offers meditation courses on topics such as beauty and ageing. \nInsight Timer's seemingly endless library of guides can be overwhelming for those just starting out, but if you are looking to further your practice or uncover other parts of yourself, this would be a good app to dive into. \nCost: Seven-day free trial, S$13.48 monthly subscription, S$81.98 yearly subscription \nAs someone who tries to keep up with her meditation practice, this experiment in trying out various apps was a helpful to see what works for me. \nI was already subscribed to Calm for its accessible Daily Calm practice and Sleep Stories, but now I'm considering a subscription to 10 Percent Happier too.\nI feel that its evidence-based approach, complemented by informative documentary-style videos, not only enhances my practice but also deepens my understanding of meditation. \nThat said, what is right for me may not be the best choice for everyone else. So I suggest you close your eyes, focus on your breath and start your own exploration of the world of meditation. "

            "Article Summary": "TODAY spoke to grassroot members, ex-colleagues, former staff and a former teacher of incoming Prime Minister Lawrence Wong.\nThey described him as a hardworking person with an eye for details yet does not lose sight of the bigger picture.\nHe was also well-liked by people around him, they said, including \"office aunties\" whom he remembers by name.\nThey also spoke of Mr Wong's passion for the people of Singapore and how he always made residents and Singaporeans his priority",
            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — When he was in the Ministry of Finance (MOF) back in the early 2000s, Mr Lee Kok Fatt remembered how his boss Lawrence Wong, then still a young public servant, would reply emails even while on leave for reservist training.\n“There were some instances when he came back to office in his army fatigue on his 'off' time. That left quite an impression on me,” said Mr Lee, who has held various senior positions in the civil service.\nFor Mr Lee, this memory reflects Mr Wong’s industriousness — one of the upcoming prime minister’s most memorable traits since his younger days.\n“He was probably one of the first to be in office, and the last to leave,” said Mr Lee, who now chairs the Chandler Institute of Governance.\nPeople who have previously interacted with or worked in various capacities with Mr Wong, including grassroot members, civil servants and a former teacher of his, painted a picture of a leader with an eye for policy details yet clear-headed in big-picture thinking, and a boss who has high standards yet is nurturing to those under his charge.\nAs an individual, they described Singapore’s next prime minister as someone who is naturally introverted yet approachable, and one who has grown comfortable in his public persona.\nDespite the years that have passed, they said that what remains constant of Mr Wong is how grounded he is and how he has always put the public before himself.\nMany who have worked with Mr Wong describe him as highly capable and a policy wonk — one who takes interest in intricate details of a policy.\nMr Lee recalled how Mr Wong took it upon himself to be certified Chartered Financial Analyst, a rigorous professional certification that was not needed for his role, despite the heavy workload he shouldered at MOF and the certification not being a necessity for his role.\n“He was already well-qualified for that role. But he just wanted the technical certificate, to get his hands dirty in the very technical aspects of finance,” said Mr Lee.\nMr Wong was a Public Service Commission scholar who earned his bachelor and masters degrees in economics in the United States before he began working in the public service. \nMr Ong Kian Ann, also one of Mr Wong’s former staffers at MOF in the early 2000s, remembered how the division had to engage economic professors to develop econometric models.\n“Throughout the discussion and conversation (with the professors), what struck me was that my boss, at his age then (of about 30), I would say, was in the same league as the professors, with their experience in the industry,” said Mr Ong.\nMr Tan Meng Dui, chief executive of the Housing and Development Board (HDB), said that Mr Wong’s “very good grasp of policy considerations and details” made him “quite easy to work with”.\nMr Tan was deputy secretary at the Ministry of National Development from 2014 to 2018. Mr Wong headed the ministry from 2015 to 2020.\n“This is especially so for public housing, where there are fiscal implications to consider and the housing needs and aspirations of the different segments of our population can be quite different,” he added.\nWhile he demonstrated a sharp eye for details, Mr Wong never lost sight of the bigger picture and was described as clear headed on the strategic level, too.\nMr Wong Siew Hoong, who was director-general for education at the Ministry of Education, recollected how there was robust debate around the introduction of blended learning in schools.\nAfter the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, blended learning was introduced in schools, where home-based learning was incorporated as a regular part of the school calendar.\nWith strong arguments both for and against the proposal, the issue was further complicated by the implications it would have on students, teachers, schools and even parents.\n“You can see his mind working, weighing the different issues, the ups and the downs and then of course to make the political decision,” said the senior advisor at MOE.\n“It was very clear in his mind: If it’s good for students, we should do it.”\nProfessor Tan Thiam Soon, former President of Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) remembered a conversation he had with Mr Wong back in 2012.\nAs then Minister of State for Education, Mr Wong had chaired an MOE committee set up to review university expansion pathways. The committee recommended making the SIT a full-fledged university.  \nProf Tan was the vice provost of education at the National University of Singapore (NUS) and was approached by MOE to move to SIT.\nBefore he made his decision, the professor asked to speak to someone about some concerns he had and was told to meet Mr Wong.\n“He doesn't throw at you lofty ideas, lofty words that could be interpreted in any direction, like a motherhood statement,” said Prof Tan.\n“He was clear about what he felt Singapore needed going forward, how (SIT) fit into the bigger picture. And even at that point, in 2012, he was clear about how the education landscape was going to change with the onset of technology disruptions.”\nProf Tan added: \"That's why I've been here (at SIT) for the last 12 years. If he had said anything else, I could have still stayed at NUS.\"\nHe was also described by some as a leader with high standards.\nMs Zing Lim Tse Yin, former deputy director in the MND Housing Division from 2015 to 2020, said: “He would not take input at face value, and would seek to understand the underlying rationale and sentiment. This encouraged healthy discussions and robust outcomes.”\nAgreeing, Mr Tan said: “DPM (Wong) is disarming and quite unintimidating for a very senior leader. But you do want to be well prepared for discussions with him.\n“He would often make counter proposals, and may have some ideas of his own or would suggest other areas to look at. So, it is important to be rigorous and comprehensive in making a policy recommendation or preparing for a discussion with him.” \nMr Wong was one who, when he spotted any mistakes, would take time to explain to those under him what went wrong and how it could be done better.\n“He is always willing to coach. That has been his trademark (trait) since about 20 years ago,” said Mr Ong.\nThat spirit carried over even to the grassroots, said some volunteers.\nMs Prema Suresh, chairperson of the Indian Activity Executive Committee at Limbang, where Mr Wong is the Member of Parliament, said that while it was common for organisers to feel nervous when a high-profile guest of honour graces an event, Mr Wong never made them feel that way.\n“If there’s a mistake, he would allow us to make it and learn from it, and get it done better,” she said.\nMr Wong’s leadership style was commonly described by those who have worked with him as open and consultative, rather than top down.\n“He explained his thoughts and concerns clearly, shared candidly about his struggles with difficult issues, and was always open to opinions and ideas from anyone in the room,” said Ms Lim, who is now director for rental housing at HDB.\nAgreeing, Mr Tan said Mr Wong would listen to views from people regardless of their seniority — “often actively asking for views or other ideas” — before making a decision or giving guidance.\nProf Tan of SIT recalled how during his conversation back in 2012, Mr Wong spent a fair amount of time listening to the professor’s concerns instead of just laying out his own vision for the university.\n“What also struck me that day was, he actually genuinely listened to me. I would say he listened more than he talked in our meeting,” said Prof Tan.\nThose who worked with him in the early part of his career described him as being generally shy and introverted.\nBased on their impression of his public appearances, they commented that he has since grown to become more comfortable in the public eye.\nWhat has remained constant though, is that Mr Wong is someone who “has no airs around him”, they said.\nMs Prema cited how Mr Wong sportingly joined residents in doing a folk dance at an event last year.\n“He himself said: ‘Hey, let’s come and join the residents and dance’. It was a very memorable thing, not just for me but for those at the event,” she said.\nMr Shi Wei Fei, a youth network volunteer at Limbang, also recalled a light-hearted moment he shared with Mr Wong.\nThe university student was the emcee for two community events that fell on the same day. Mr Wong had attended both events, on top of a few other engagements in between.\n“When he saw me at the second event, he quipped: ‘Wow, you provide full-time emcee service?’. I Imagined he must have felt more tired than me; he didn’t have to joke with me, but he did,” said Mr Shi.\nMr Lee, formerly from MOF, said that Mr Wong could remember the office attendants by name and chatted with them.\n“The office attendants, the aunties in the office, they all liked him a lot. He has good relations at all levels,” said Mr Lee.\nSome who have worked with him before said Mr Wong would still address them by name and asked how they are doing when they bump into each other at events, even if they have not worked closely with each other for years.\nAccording to a former teacher, his affability was apparent from his school days.\nMrs Pang Lay Har, who taught Mr Wong civics and mathematics at Victoria Junior College, recalled how he got along well with his classmates, who came from diverse backgrounds.\n\"He exuded a warm presence, coupled with humility and sincerity,\" said Mrs Pang, who is now vice-principal of Tampines Meridian Junior College.\nThe educator also recalled Mr Wong as a well-rounded student who excelled in his studies — \"he would ask questions and contribute good ideas\" from his usual seat near the back of the class, she said — and in his co-curricular activity, choir.\nAnd while the public probably only took notice of Mr Wong's musical talent after he became a high-profile figure, Mrs Pang knew of his skills some 30 years ago.\n\"He had a flair for music, and I fondly remember being pleasantly surprised when he came to see me with the classmates to sing me a song during Teachers’ Day, and he was playing the guitar,\" she recounted.\nMrs Pang also recalled a conversation she had with the young Mr Wong when he was seeking her advice on scholarships.\n\"We spoke about commitment and serving the bond that comes with the scholarship.  What impressed me was that he was thinking about how he could contribute and serve the community. I knew then this was a promising young man whose heart was in the right place,\" she said.\nThose who worked with him at the grassroots level mentioned how Mr Wong sets aside time for his residents, despite wearing many hats.\nFor example, Limbang has eight residents’ network groups that would typically hold their own celebration for a festive holiday.\n“Sometimes they fall on the same day. So he would be here, and an hour later he would be there (at another one). He tries his best to be with the residents at such festive events,” said Ms Prema.\nMr Shi of Limbang Youth Network describes Mr Wong as an MP who takes residents’ feedback very seriously.\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, resident engagement sessions were held over Zoom and organised by blocks. One resident raised an issue to Mr Wong, who dealt with it promptly, said the volunteer.\n“The resident (some time later) hopped on the Zoom call meant for residents of another block, just to personally say to Mr Wong, ‘Thank you, my problem is resolved’,” he said.\nThis was one example of perhaps one of the key traits that Mr Wong had as a leader: One who puts the community over self.\n“DPM Wong has a big heart — even as prudence and parity are key concerns in policymaking, above all his top concern was to be progressive,” said Ms Lim.\nMr Ong, formerly from MOF, said: “As economists, of course you can make big money in the financial sector. But he chose to be in the public service. \n“He chose to serve because he wants to use his skill set to see how he can shape and form policy for the greater good of Singaporeans as a whole.” \nProf Tan said Mr Wong possesses many qualities that make him “the ideal man” for the politics of this era, which is more centered on inclusivity and a disavowal of elitism.\n“The ability to be humble, the ability not to say I know everything, but to listen to the people and bring their perspectives to the policy — I think it will bring great strengths in what could be a very challenging and difficult time for him and for all of us,” he said.\n"

            "Article Summary": "Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong recently announced plans for having additional safeguards around excessive screen time for children.\nThis came amid a rise in mental health concerns worldwide among the younger generation.\nExperts say that media use for children under two years old has been linked to developmental issues.\nTODAY speaks to eight parents on their personal experiences and challenges in limiting screen time for their children",
            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — Before having children, Ms Lily Khairunnisa and her husband had a vision of raising their future children in a completely \"screen-free\" environment, knowing well the potential harmful effects it could one day bring.\nBut just two years after their first son was born, they came to realise that it was impossible to keep screens away from him, eventually turning to television as a tool to help keep him occupied.\nThey now have three kids aged four, 10 and 11, with the latter two just receiving their own mobile phones a month ago.\n“We need that precious break to keep them quiet so we can do other things like prepping for an outing or even just going to the loo,” said 36-year-old Ms Lily, an investment business owner.\n“These pockets of breaks help keep us sane.”\nLast weekend, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said that the Government would consider additional safeguards around excessive screen time and social media use for children, to protect the mental health of young people.\nHe was speaking at a 55th anniversary event of suicide prevention centre Samaritans of Singapore.\nMr Wong, a patron of the organisation, announced the plan amid an increase in mental health concerns among the younger generation worldwide.\n“Screen time during infancy adversely affects development of cognitive skills needed for self-regulation and learning, as well as socio-emotional competence as the child grows up. This in turn raises the risk of mental conditions, such as depression,” he said in his speech.\nTODAY spoke to eight parents who shared their views and challenges in limiting their children’s use of digital devices. While all agreed that too much screen time is bad for their children, some struggle to cap their usage.\nLike Ms Lily, Mr Derrick Yuen and his wife let their daughter watch nursery rhyme videos while Mrs Yuen does household chores.\nThe 51-year-old data consultant said that it was more about setting a clear, practical rule from the beginning — that screen time is only for whenever it is necessary, but not avoiding it entirely.\nHe limits the use of electronic devices only for school-related activities and does not allow his three children to be on social media.\n“My wife and I wanted our children to have less screen time, not no screen time — given the state of our world today, it would be difficult and impractical,” said Mr Yuen.\nAgreeing, Ms Christine Mah, a workspace services manager, said that the moving images and music in videos have helped her then two-year-old daughter to learn nursery rhymes better.\n“When faced with the various needs of the child and the grandparents who helped raise her, we had to adapt to the changing situations and environment, and to strike a balance between limiting (device) use and meaningful exposure,” she said.\nFor 40-year-old Archita Biswas, it felt like she had “no choice” but to allow her daughter, when she was one year old, to have screen time to ensure she eats. Her daughter is 13 now.\nMs Archita said: “She was never a co-operative eater, so the Disney Junior channel was our saviour. When we switched on the television, at least we were able to feed her a few spoons.”\nTogether with her husband, Mr Vedha Giri, they gradually engaged in “friendly discussions” that do not “sound like a lecture” with their daughter on the health effects of excessive screen time.\nMs Lily said that limiting her children’s screen time came with challenges.\n“My parents and siblings would sometimes offer their phones to my kids even though I've told them that I do not want screen time for them. I would usually just close one eye in these situations.”\nShe added that due to excessive screen times, her children would sometimes throw unnecessary tantrums and show a lack of social awareness, such as not responding to others who call for them.\nLike the rest of the parents interviewed, 50-year-old IT project manager and father of three Maheswaran Subramaniam supports the idea of having additional safeguards on excessive screen time, but he believes that parents still play an important role.\nFellow IT professional Ghazali Maricar, 53, agreed that “everyone can support a common cause” if safeguards are publicly available, instead of just parents taking it upon themselves.\nFamily life educator and consultant Esther Foong-Tan, 39, suggested looking into equipping and resourcing parents with alternative ways to engage children aged four and below.\n“Residents' committees or community centres can organise age-appropriate activities in the neighbourhood for parents to easily bring their children for hours of fun, or forming wholesome and positive parent communities that can share resources and ideas,” said Ms Foong-Tan, who also co-founded parents support group SGFamilies.\n“These can help to free up time for parent-child interactions, as well as manage the stress of parenting.”\nMs Siti Raudah, a 39-year-old teacher and mother of two daughters aged three and five, said that children need to be exposed to more play-based interactions with peers of the same age, be it in school or at home.\n“Game advertisements on YouTube should also be minimised so that their attention will not be diverted to wanting to download these apps,” she added.\nMr Yuen raised concerns on the use of electronic devices as learning tools in schools at a young age.\n“As it stands, I feel that MOE's (Ministry of Education) plan to expose children to mobile devices and the internet in primary school is too early as they are not mature enough and lack self-regulation, especially the boys,” said Mr Yuen.\nEchoing this sentiment, Ms Archita said: “While the safeguards are good, I feel the Government should also stop the usage of learning devices like iPads and Chromebooks in schools as children are using them for a prolonged period, and it is affecting their eye health. They are also diverted to websites that have no links to schoolwork.”\nMs Melissa Goh, a senior lecturer of the early childhood education programme at the Singapore University of Social Sciences, said that studies have shown links between media use for children under two years old and developmental issues like delays in learning languages.\nScreen time or screen-based learning offers a more passive experience of learning that limits benefits across cognitive, social, emotional and physical domains, she added.\n“I would recommend that parents limit the duration and filter the type of media that the child watches by opting for educational shows that are age-appropriate and depict real-life experiences and scenes.”\nShe also proposed counter measures such as having breaks and ensuring that the child has a decent amount of time outdoors and playing with toys or physical objects.\nDr Jason Gan, a lecturer in the same programme, said that the Government should engage parents and caregivers and raise their awareness on the issue.\n“They should specifically address gaps in understanding the implications of excessive screen time and educate parents on utilising 'parental controls' within digital devices.”\nHe also proposed having a national movement such as a \"no screen hour\", which can be an effective way of raising awareness and promoting reduced screen time."

            "Article Summary": "Theatregoers to the Hamilton musical in Singapore, as well as fans of Icelandic jazz-pop singer Laufey due to perform in September here, were surprised to hear that their events would be priced based on demand.\nDynamic pricing for entertainment events has been a hotly debated issue elsewhere, such as in the US.\nIf this becomes a norm in Singapore, fans said they fear that ticket prices will skyrocket.\nBut economists say dynamic pricing is an equitable way to price concert tickets which have been \"traditionally underpriced\".\nThe Consumers Association of Singapore and the Ministry of Trade and Industry told TODAY they are monitoring the impact of dynamic pricing in Singapore's concert industry",
            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — When ticket sales for Singapore’s limited run of the Hamilton musical began last November, an excited Syazwan Ramli, 25, did not hesitate to snag two prime tickets for S$250 each to a Sunday show.\nThe National University of Singapore law graduate was worried that, like so many cases of highly anticipated stage productions in the past year, tickets for the award-winning musical would disappear as soon as they became available because of zealous fans and scalpers.\nSo, to Mr Syazwan at the time, there was no need to think twice, he told TODAY.\nBut his buyers’ remorse set in days after the purchase when Mr Syazwan saw that similar seats for the same category on the weekend were being sold for as low as S$220.\nThe reason for the price difference? Dynamic pricing was in effect, which meant that prices of tickets fluctuated based on demand, instead of the traditional practice of setting prices upfront based on seat categories.\nThis is similar to how surge pricing works for ride-hailing, bookings of hotel accommodation and flight tickets.\nUnder this model, Mr Syazwan paid the maximum price for the category he had selected, though if demand had been low, he would have paid less for the same seat.\n\"I didn't check whether the prices were cheaper on other dates because I was rushing to get tickets and went with whatever I could get,\" he said. \n\"If I had known there would be tickets left and they were cheaper, I would not have rushed and just waited it out... It's really because of FOMO (fear of missing out).\"\nDynamic pricing for entertainment events, such as live concerts, musicals and festivals, is a recent trend in ticketing practices used by event promoters to match ticket prices to demand.\nIn recent years, the US and Canada concerts of American country singer Bruce Springsteen, pop singer Harry Styles, as well as British alt-rock band Coldplay caught flak for implementing dynamic pricing for ticket sales.\nLast year, when US fans of pop singer Beyonce fought over tickets for her Renaissance Tour, prices were pushed upwards of US$1,000 (S$1,350) each because of the dynamic pricing model.\nResponding to the backlash to the Springsteen concert in the US, American ticket sales platform Ticketmaster said dynamic pricing prevents scalpers from buying tickets at face value and reselling them at higher prices for personal profit. \n“Dynamic pricing is about capturing more value for the artist at the initial on-sale, versus that value going to people reselling tickets on the secondary market,” Ticketmaster spokesperson said to US news outlets.\nIn essence, this means the premium that fans are willing to pay for resold tickets goes to the artists, organisers and promoters directly, rather than to the scalpers.\nBut in Singapore, concertgoers fear that such a pricing model may now be creeping into the scene and end up raising the prices of tickets overall.\nAhead of Icelandic jazz-pop singer Laufey’s Singapore concert on Sept 4, several fans were up in arms over an announcement that ticket prices would be \"subject to change in accordance to demand\", with rates starting from S$98.\nNo cap on prices was announced, unlike during the sale of Hamilton tickets in which promoters said dynamic prices would be limited to S$300, depending on the category chosen.\nBut prior to the start of ticket sales on Monday, Laufey’s event promoter Live Nation removed a poster displaying the clause that concert tickets were priced based on demand, though its website still showed that information.\nIt is unclear if tickets were ultimately sold based on dynamic pricing, but the announcement has caused several concertgoers to question whether such a model would become the norm in future.\nTODAY has reached out to Laufey's public relations team and Live Nation for comment.\nNonetheless, Laufey fans went blindly into the ticketing war as they were only informed that prices started at S$98, several fans who spoke to TODAY said.\nUpon entering the ticketing page, they were greeted with a seat map in two different shades of blue. \nSeats indicated in light blue were sold for prices above S$200, while tickets in navy blue were cheaper. Hovering over different categories would show different prices within the hundred-dollar range.\nBut with expected high demand coupled with little time to react before the concert sold out, some fans spent beyond their initial budget to procure the tickets. One 13-year-old fan who wanted to be known only as Irdina left empty-handed.\n\"We didn't know the specific price until the day of the ticket sales. So when I tried to purchase tickets for the category I wanted, it was way higher than expected,\" said the secondary school student.\nBy the time she found a category with prices she could afford, tickets had sold out.\nMr Zachary, 27, is all too familiar with dynamic pricing. The writer and self-professed Taylor Swift fan closely followed the debate around its use for Swift's The Eras Tour in the US last year.\n\"When I saw Laufey's concert was subject to dynamic pricing, I thought 'Oh, they are doing this in Singapore now?',\" said Mr Zachary, a foreigner working in Singapore who declined to share his full name.\n\"It pissed me off because there was no cap on prices. At least Taylor had a max of about US$1,000 so customers knew what to expect.\"\nLaufey's most expensive ticket went for about S$260, which is 160 per cent higher than the S$98 starting price. This was also S$175 more than tickets for the Icelandic singer's performance in June 2023 at Pasir Panjang Power Station, which were priced at S$85.\nMr Zachary added that concerts in Singapore were often already more expensive relative to other venues around the world, so dynamic pricing feels \"unnecessary\".\nAs for 25-year-old civil servant Evangeline Wong, the idea of being the \"guinea pig\" for dynamic pricing was upsetting, given that such a pricing model for concert tickets was unheard of in Singapore until recently. \n\"I know that Singapore is trying to position itself as a concert hub, but this anti-consumer tactic (dynamic pricing) is going to make the already frustrating ticketing process worse,\" said Ms Wong.\nWhile concert promoters elsewhere have claimed that dynamic pricing would deter scalpers by pricing tickets to match what people are willing to pay, Ms Wong felt that the jury is still out on whether this works as scalpers and bots already artificially inflate the demand for concert tickets.\nFor 27-year-old Christalle Tay, who bought a Hamilton ticket under dynamic pricing, she acknowledged that there will be price differences based on demand anyway, since traditionally, weekend tickets fetch a premium over those for weekdays.\nWhile dynamic pricing does not necessarily mean higher prices all the time, she does not believe concert promoters who implement such a model intend to lower prices for tickets with less demand.\n\"As a consumer, I’d obviously prefer if prices were fair and equal. Unless the dynamic pricing was to pass on savings to consumers,\" said Ms Tay, who works as an interpreter. \"But I highly doubt it would.\"\nEconomists told TODAY that dynamic pricing takes into account several factors — supply, demand, time of day and location. In some industries, like ride-hailing services, the weather might also play a factor.\nLike others around the world, dynamic pricing is seen by economists as the most \"equitable\" way to price entertainment event tickets.\n\"Historically, entertainment event tickets like sporting events and concerts have been underpriced,\" said Associate Professor Walter Theseira from the Singapore University of Social Studies, pointing to American football championships The Super Bowl as an example.\n\"This is because they fear not being able to sell out. There's also publicity if people queue for tickets and fans feel appreciated.\"\nBy using dynamic pricing, companies can streamline their offerings according to market demand, allowing them to maximise profits, said Dr Hannah Chang, an associate professor of marketing at the Singapore Management University.\nIn an ideal sense, dynamic pricing would also allow consumers to benefit as prices are lower due to low demand. This helps ensure tickets are not outpriced and seats are left empty.\nBut in terms of how fans view a dynamic pricing approach, the experts said there could be a negative impact on consumer satisfaction.\n\"Though it might help improve efficiency and profits in the process… if fans or concertgoers do not expect it or see it as unfair, this may lead to unhappiness in the market demand side,\" said Dr Chang.\nAssoc Prof Theseira believes that this is because entertainers need to consider fan culture too, which explains why dynamic pricing is generally accepted by consumers for services such as airlines and ride-hailing as the norm, but not for concert tickets.\nHe said customer satisfaction and loyalty are important for an artist's career longevity, and such pricing methods might be seen as a cash grab.\nTo this end, Assoc Prof Theseira said that a dynamic pricing model should also be transparent to consumers so that people can understand how prices are affected.\nGiven that such a system is relatively new here, there is not enough information for people to understand how dynamic pricing is calculated.\nIn response to TODAY, Consumers Association of Singapore (Case) president Melvin Yong said that ticket sales practices should be \"fair and transparent\".\n\"Case is aware of the growing popularity of ticket surge pricing and is studying potential disamenities,\" said Mr Yong, who is also a Member of Parliament for Radin Mas Single Member Constituency.\n\"Events that intend to implement surge pricing for their tickets should inform consumers up front that ticket prices may rise or fall subsequently, so that consumers can make informed purchase decisions.\"\nThe Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) also said that there is no prohibition on such pricing models between willing buyers and sellers, subject to the terms and conditions of the event organiser.\n\"Nonetheless, businesses should communicate prices in a clear and transparent manner, including any relevant terms and conditions,\" said MTI.\n\"Consumers should also familiarise themselves with such terms and conditions so they can make more informed decisions before making their purchases.\"\nThe ministry added it has not received any complaints, but it is monitoring the impact of surge pricing on consumers and the concert ticket industry."

            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — Lots of sharply contrasting stories swirl around the topic of Johor property.\nThere are those like 27-year-old Kylie Hung, who moved into a three-bedroom condominium in Johor Bahru seven months ago and is enjoying access to features such as a pool, butler service and a private beach. \nShe currently pays about RM3,500 (S$1,000) a month for the mortgage and maintenance fees on her Country Garden Danga Bay condominium, and is happy with her purchase. \nBut then there are those with regrets, such as Mr Eric Sim, who bought two four-bedroom units of 2,400 sq ft each near JB Sentral in 2014 as investments.\nProspects might have looked good then, driven by economic development and mega infrastructure projects such as the Kuala Lumpur–Singapore high-speed rail (HSR), but things subsequently went downhill. \nThe onslaught of new projects raised supply above demand, the 2018 Malaysian general election culminated in a change in government and policies, such as the cancellation of the HSR project and the ringgit continued to weaken against the Singapore dollar. \nMr Sim finally sold both units this year, incurring a loss of RM500,000. \n“It was the worst investment of my life,” he said. \nIn addition to such anecdotes is a constant flow of news, both good and bad, about infrastructure and business developments in Johor. What is a prospective Singaporean buyer meant to make of it all? TODAY takes a closer look.\nIskandar Malaysia comprises the Johor Bahru District, Kulai District and part of the Pontian District. Officially launched in 2006, it encompasses an area of 2,217 sq km, nearly three times the size of Singapore. \nSome of the major cities in Iskandar include Johor Bahru city centre, Iskandar Puteri (where Legoland is) and Pasir Gudang, one of the largest industrial areas in Malaysia. \nThe launch of Iskandar was aimed at attracting international investments that would drive economic growth for the state.\nUntil recently, the piece de resistance of Iskandar was supposed to be Forest City, a colossal luxury real estate project on four man-made islands in the Johor Strait, overlooking the Singapore border. \nLaunched in 2013, Forest City was envisioned as a futuristic, green, and smart city. It is Chinese developer Country Garden's largest overseas project, and was planned to house 700,000 people by 2035.\nDespite its ambitious vision, the project encountered several challenges and controversies due to a mix of low sales, Chinese restrictions on capital outflows, border closures during the pandemic and public backlash against China's increasing influence in Malaysia.\nIn December 2023, CNA reported that only 15 per cent of the entire project had been completed. \nNotwithstanding the several stumbling blocks over the years, interest in Johor homes remains high among Singaporeans.\nIn January, for example, there was some hype over properties near Bukit Chagar — where the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) Link station is located — after a commemorative ceremony attended by then-Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. \nBut real estate experts told TODAY that rising inflation and property prices at home are the more important reasons driving Singaporean homebuyers up north.\nSix property agents TODAY spoke to said that while a significant number of Singaporeans are looking to buy Johor homes for investment, there are also those looking to live there or have a second home.\nExperiences vary widely among those who have taken the plunge, which has made it difficult for some to decipher whether Johor property is a good investment.\nOperations director Victor Lee, 53, and his wife Crystal Wang, 38, are among those with no regrets. When TODAY met the couple on May 15, they had just collected the keys to their two-bedroom unit at R&F Princess Cove, which they now call home.\nMr Lee said there have been promising improvements with regard to traffic on the Causeway, with both governments constantly making efforts to smoothen the travel process, such as the recent implementation of electronic gates. \nBut some who entered the Johor property market 10 years ago did not see their investments bear fruit. \nA supply chain manager who wished to be known only as Mr Lee invested in a property in 2014: An RM1.7 million double-story cluster house in Horizon Hills.\n“I expected to be able to sell my house within five years and make a profit due to capital appreciation,” said the 40-year-old. \nHowever, things did not go as planned. In his view, the launch of Forest City “killed the property market”. \n“There’s an oversupply of units because of the project. We did not expect the developers from China to come in that fast. If I were to sell now, I would be looking at a loss,” said Mr Lee. \nAll things considered, is investing in a property in Johor a worthwhile investment? Property experts and homeowners advise prospective buyers to do their homework thoroughly before making a decision. \nMr Sim, the former investment banker, said one should refrain from following investment trends without research.\n“If I could turn back time, I would do a little more research on the economic activities in the area. I would also check the housing supply – not the number of units available at that point in time, but the amount of land and whether property developers would build more.\n“If I had done my homework back in 2014, I would've found information that other developers had plans to go big,” he said, referring to Forest City. \nMr Faizul of Far Capital stressed the importance of looking at a property in Malaysia through the lens of a local, instead of a Singaporean.\n“When you use a Singaporean mindset to buy a property in Johor, it's suicidal,” he said, since the buyer may end up overpaying for their purchase. \nWhen investing based on the potential of future infrastructure and amenities, Mr Faizul also advised prospective buyers to be patient and only make the move when there is concrete movement for the projects.  \n“Like the RTS, when you see movements from both governments, then you know for sure it won’t be cancelled. (Wait until things are) built first, instead of investing during the talking stage.\""

            "Article Body": "Each week, TODAY’s long-running Big Read series delves into the trends and issues that matter. This week, we look at how Singapore workers can navigate their growing priority on work-life balance without losing their competitive edge. This is a shortened version of the full feature, which can be found here.\nSINGAPORE — For new mother Nur Sabrina Muhleseddin, being able to enjoy work-life balance is something she values in a job, as it allows her to be present for her son’s milestones.\nThe 29-year-old digital marketing manager said her priorities have shifted since she gave birth in July last year. She was working in a different company previously, but had sought out a new role four months after becoming a mother. \nBeing able to balance work with caring for her son is especially important to Ms Nur Sabrina, whose husband works in the hospitality industry as a shift manager — often having to work irregular hours and on weekends.\nHer flexible work post-pregnancy would mean that at least one of them — herself or her husband — can be present for their child, she said.\nCurrently, she works almost entirely from home — save for a few in-person meetings with her clients at their offices about once or twice a week.\n“I think presently, nothing is more important than to be able to witness my son growing up and being around for his milestones.\n“I’ve had a good few years of working up the ladder. Right now, I just need a job so that I can provide food on the table and share the bills with my husband,” said Ms Nur Sabrina.\nThe approach embraced by Ms Nur Sabrina reflects a growing shift among Singapore workers towards prioritising work-life balance — with many recognising that work is not everything, and hence desiring to spend less time at work and more time on personal pursuits.\nRecent surveys have shown a growing expectation among the Singapore workforce for greater work-life harmony.\nA survey done by recruitment agency Randstad in 2023 found that more respondents are prioritising work-life balance over salary: Ninety-five per cent of Singapore workers said that having work-life balance is important to them in their current and future jobs, compared to 90 per cent who said pay is important.\nRelated to the greater yearning for work-life balance is flexible work options, which allow employees to carve out a suitable work-life rhythm tailored to their individual needs at different life stages.\nFrom December this year, all firms in Singapore will be required to have a formal process in place for their employees to request for flexible working arrangements.\nHowever, the release of the guidelines last month has also reignited debate on the issue of work-life balance and flexible work, which has long attracted polarising sentiments — even to the extent of some questioning whether Singapore workers have increasingly lost their hunger and drive.\nIn the wake of the announcement, some employers had also come out to say that they may even rethink hiring local staff, and instead look overseas for recruitment.\nThe debate also begs the broader question: In resource-scarce Singapore, is it too much for employees to seek a better quality of life by way of better work-life balance?\nOr must its workforce — as the nation’s prime resource — remain in a perpetual state of being “kiasu” (Singlish for “scared to lose”), for fear of others stealing its rice bowl and ultimately losing its overall competitive edge?\nHuman resource and sociology experts told TODAY that while the Covid-19 pandemic may have accelerated the demand for better work-life balance and flexible work as more employees recognise the feasibility of such arrangements, the growing expectation for work-life balance is ultimately not a new phenomenon.\nAssociate Professor Tan Ern Ser, a sociologist from National University of Singapore (NUS), said that even before working from home became a feature of the new post-pandemic work norm, there has been a “silent but significant value shift towards prioritising work autonomy and quality of life” — and, in turn, work-life balance — with Singapore becoming a more affluent, post-materialist society.\nDr Shannon Ang, an assistant professor of sociology at Nanyang Technological University, said that the slower economic growth Singapore sees today compared to the past could prompt a new generation of workers to feel like it is “less ‘worth it’ to keep pursuing economic growth”, as they do not enjoy the same extent of progress.\n“Older cohorts saw palpable change in their living conditions for the sacrifices that they made. Younger cohorts are unlikely to see the same kind of progress, and are probably quickly realising it may be better to invest their time in pursuits that seem more meaningful to them,” said Dr Ang.\nAt the same time, experts also cautioned against the general tendency to assume that the desire for work-life balance is mainly confined to a younger generation of workers.  \nMr Richard Bradshaw, the Asia chief executive officer of recruitment consultancy Ethos BeathChapman, noted that the desire for better work-life balance has grown to be a “common requirement” across different working demographics and ages today, and to some extent, may even be perceived as a form of “basic workers’ rights”.\nEmployees also disagree with the notion that those who yearn for work-life balance are less hungry for success.\nFather of three Edwin Ho, 47, said that a person who devotes equal amounts of time to work and personal life can be more successful, productive and fulfilling, than a person who only works hard and spends huge amounts of time at work while sacrificing other matters in life, like spending time with family and friends or travelling.\n“I think we first must define (our) purpose for working hard and what success is, so that we can work towards that goal and in doing so, learn to find a balance between work and personal life.”\nThe senior associate director at Finexis Advisory made the switch from an engineer in the Republic of Singapore Air Force to his current career in personal finance to be able to spend more time with his children, who are aged 19, 16, and 14 years old.\nMr Jivan Tulsiani, head of marketing at blockchain firm TZ APAC, also agreed that a growing demand for work-life balance does not reflect a lack of hunger from employees.\n“It’s more of a shift in how ambitious professionals define success. It’s important to understand the concept of purpose, which is an aggregate of components such as talent, passion, skills, occupation, charity and service,” he said.\nWith more people yearning for better work-life harmony, the million-dollar question is whether, from employers’ point of view, it is too much to ask for.\nSome employers, especially those in the services industries, told TODAY that it is difficult to accede to employees’ requests, given the nature of their role and industry.\nOther challenges they raised include the difficulty of monitoring employees’ productivity and performance when they work remotely or are operating on flexible schedules.\nAlso of concern to employers are potential impacts on business operations and stakeholder relationships, ensuring fair team workload distribution, and any associated costs, said Ms Khew Shu Ping, deputy managing director of public relations agency Tate Anzur.\nSome employers who recognise the need to afford their employees greater work-life harmony said that they also have such employees who are high achievers.\nMr Winthrop Wong, co-founder and pharmacist at e-pharmacy Glovida-Rx, said this is the case of some of its medical sales staff. \n“We set them qualitative and quantitative goals on a yearly and monthly basis and if they are able to achieve these targets, we basically allow them to schedule their days in what is most productive to them.”\nUltimately, there is no need for Singapore workers to remain in a perpetually “kiasu” state — more “work”, less “life” — to ensure they retain their competitive edge, said experts.\nThey pointed out that competitiveness is multi-faceted, and prioritising work-life balance does not have to come at the expense of a workforce’s attractiveness or economic progress.\nIn 2022, the BBC reported that Norway and Denmark had work weeks that were shorter than 40 hours, yet were respectively the second- and seventh-most productive countries in the world then.\nFor one thing, what workers may lose out on in absolute hours put into work can be made up for in other ways, such as increased productivity during the actual time they are at their jobs.\nAssociate Professor Nicholas Sim, from the Singapore University of Social Sciences’ School of Business, said: “While there are trade-offs between competitiveness and work-life balance, it is not necessarily true that work-life balance must be sacrificed to increase competitiveness, particularly if this refers to an increase in productivity.”\nHighlighting findings from studies which surveyed respondents of various occupations and skill levels, Assoc Prof Sim said that working beyond a certain threshold of hours may in fact increase errors and decrease one’s productivity.\n“Moreover, many studies have also consistently shown that poorer employee well-being is associated with increased disengagement and intentions to quit,\" he said,\n“A hyper-competitive corporate culture may also foster toxic work environments that ultimately undermines productivity.”\nAs the push for flexible work arrangements gains momentum even as Singapore strives to maintain its competitive edge, both employers and employees will have their work cut out for them in navigating this new landscape.\nFor a prospective employee, expressing a desire for greater work-life balance by way of flexible work arrangements — especially at the job interview stage — may work against the candidate, if the employer does not have such work arrangements in place, said Mr Suhaimi Salleh, chief executive officer of consultancy and professional training firm SSA Group.\nAt the same time, employers who do not offer such flexible work arrangements may also find themselves at a disadvantage in attracting and retaining talent, especially as workers’ expectations for work-life balance continue to evolve, he said.\nThis is also a point that Manpower Minister Tan See Leng has made in explaining the rationale of flexible work arrangements. \nUltimately, the transition towards fully embracing greater work-life balance — premised on a mindset of results-oriented work — will require cultural and mindset shifts, which would take time, said experts.\nLeading up to that, employers told TODAY that building a culture of mutual trust and open communication with their employees would be key to a smooth transition.\nStill, all these are worthy adjustments to be made.\nMr Tulsiani of TZ APAC, said: “The lines between work and personal life are not as clear as it was before: Professionals today view their occupation as an important piece of a jigsaw puzzle that embodies their purpose in life. \n“It is one of the many priorities they devote their attention to, in addition to family, health, passion, service, charity, talent development and more.\n“Putting their employees’ purposes at the forefront of policy making will (thus) be key to retaining and attracting the best people, which is the lifeblood of any organisation.”"

She currently pays about RM3,500 (S$1,000) a month for the mortgage and maintenance fees. \nWhile she's happy with her purchase, she acknowledged that moving to Johor Bahru works for her because of her job’s flexibility, and it might not be for everyone.\n“For those working 9am to 6pm, I wouldn’t recommend it because the jam on the Causeway can be quite bad.” \nEven so, buying property in Johor was all the hype among Singaporeans about a decade ago, when Iskandar Malaysia, the main southern economic corridor in Johor, opened for business.\nThe draw for those Singaporeans was much the same as for Ms Hung: The ability to own and live in a luxury home at a much lower price than its equivalent in Singapore.\nSince then, TODAY has found that there are those who are pleased they made the leap and those who regret it.\nMr Eric Sim, who bought two four-bedroom units of 2,400 sq ft each near JB Sentral in 2014, said the investment had left a bad taste in his mouth until today. \nEach unit of four bedrooms and six bathrooms was financed with a bank loan after a 10 per cent down payment. \nAlthough prospects looked good then, driven by economic development and mega infrastructure projects such as the Kuala Lumpur–Singapore high-speed rail (HSR), things subsequently went downhill. \n“I bought them as an investment because I thought (Iskandar) would be the next Shenzhen. But it was just an illusion,” the 54-year-old career book author lamented. \n“I realised after buying that there were no big companies in Johor Bahru, whereas, in Shenzhen, there are Tencent, Huawei, and Shenzhen Airlines. So, there won’t be any high-salary talent attraction to support the high property prices.”\nThree more factors threw Mr Sim’s plans out of kilter: The onslaught of new projects raised supply above demand, the 2018 Malaysian general election culminated in a change in government and policies, such as the cancellation of the HSR project and lastly, the ringgit continued to weaken against the Singapore dollar. \nWhen he invested in his properties in 2014, S$1 was about RM2.60. In February this year, the Singapore dollar rose to a record high of RM3.55.\nMr Sim found it difficult to rent out his properties. Even if he had found tenants, the rental would not have been enough to cover his monthly upkeep due to the exchange rate, he said. \nHe finally sold both units this year, at a loss. His total investment cost him a little over RM3 million, but he incurred a loss of RM500,000. \n“It was the worst investment of my life,” Mr Sim said. \nEven so, interest in Johor homes remains high among Singaporeans. In January, for example, there was some hype over properties near Bukit Chagar — where the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) Link station is located — after a commemorative ceremony attended by then-Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. \nBut real estate experts told TODAY that rising inflation and property prices at home are the more important reasons driving Singaporean homebuyers up north.\nThe RTS Link is slated to start passenger service by the end of 2026. Once operational, it is expected to ease bottlenecks on the Causeway, allowing easier access across the border. \nThe consistent demand, not just from Singaporeans but investors worldwide too, has buoyed property prices in Johor, which have risen threefold since 2010, according to data from Malaysia’s National Property Information Centre (Napic). \nBut other news events paint a less rosy picture of the Johor property market.\nLast year, Forest City, the flagship US$100 billion (S$135 billion) mega-project by Chinese developer Country Garden, was dubbed a “ghost town” by the media as the housing estates there were reportedly largely unoccupied.  \nSome buyers, including Singaporeans, were cited by international news outlets expressing disappointment and regret over their investments. A handful said they were fortunate to have sold off their units before the situation took a turn for the worse. \nIn 2022, over at Country Garden Danga Bay, disgruntled owners from Singapore, Malaysia, and China filed a class-action lawsuit against the developer, alleging that the developer's luxury condominium was not delivered as advertised.\nSo, for potential investors or homeowners mulling whether to leap into the Johor property market, it can be quite difficult to figure out what the wise decision would be.\nTODAY examines the reasons behind the current influx of Singaporean buyers in Johor, what they look for in a Johor property and the key things one should consider before putting money down on a house across the border.\nWhen Singaporeans think of Johor, it is typically the Johor Bahru area that comes to mind, but in fact, the state government’s plans to drive Johor’s economic growth extend beyond the city centre. \nIskandar Malaysia comprises the Johor Bahru District, Kulai District and part of the Pontian District. Officially launched in 2006, it encompasses an area of 2,217 sq km, nearly three times the size of Singapore. \nSome of the major cities in Iskandar include Johor Bahru city centre, Iskandar Puteri (where Legoland is) and Pasir Gudang, one of the largest industrial areas in Malaysia. \nThe launch of Iskandar was aimed at attracting international investments that would drive economic growth for the state. And within Iskandar is the township development of Medini, envisioned as Iskandar Puteri’s central business district (CBD). Here, there are no restrictions on foreign homeownership.\nGenerally, foreigners buying properties in Johor must adhere to a minimum purchase price of RM1 million. However, exemptions are granted to certain projects, especially if they were approved before the threshold was implemented on May 1, 2014. \nUntil recently, the piece de resistance of Iskandar was supposed to be Forest City, a colossal luxury real estate project on four man-made islands in the Johor Strait, overlooking the Singapore border. \nLaunched in 2013, Forest City was envisioned as a futuristic, green, and smart city. It is Chinese developer Country Garden's largest overseas project, and was planned to house 700,000 people by 2035.\nDespite its ambitious vision, the project encountered several challenges and controversies due to a mix of low sales, Chinese restrictions on capital outflows, border closures during the pandemic and public backlash against China's increasing influence in Malaysia.\nLast August, the developer said the project was proceeding as planned despite issues involving \"political landscape and interference, economic stability, government policy\".\nIn December 2023, CNA reported that only 15 per cent of the entire project had been completed. According to the developer, a total of 28,000 residential units have been completed, with 80 per cent of these units sold to buyers from over 30 countries. \nAround 9,000 residents are said to live in Forest City. TODAY has reached out to Country Garden for the latest figures. \nIn an attempt to spur economic development and attract investors, Forest City was announced as a Special Financial Zone (SFZ) last August. With this designation, businesses are offered incentives to set up operations here, such as a flat income tax rate of 15 per cent instead of the usual 30 per cent, for skilled foreign workers. \nIn preparation for the SFZ designation, Country Garden is building a new Customs checkpoint, which is expected to be completed by the end of this year. It also announced that several transportation-related infrastructure projects within the massive enclave are in progress.   \nSome international media outlets reported in April that talks were being held on opening a casino in Forest City, citing unnamed sources. But Prime Minister Anwar was quick to squash all talk with an “affirmative no” to the idea. \nDespite the negative news around Forest City, the relaunch of the RTS Link project by Singapore and Malaysia may have renewed Singaporeans’ interest in owning property across the border. \nMr Tan Kin Lian, a two-time presidential candidate, is among those who have long appreciated the merits of owning a second home there. In 2018, he purchased a 1,100 sq ft three-bedroom unit in Forest City for about RM1.6 million, paid fully in cash. \nHe makes the 2.5-hour journey across Tuas Second Link by public transport twice or thrice a month and stays there three days each time. \nWhen this TODAY reporter met the 76-year-old at his Johor abode on May 18, a Saturday, he seemed very much at home. He said he enjoys the peace and tranquillity, as well as the unblocked view of Johor’s greenery from his balcony. \nFor a place where supposedly 9,000 residents are staying, this reporter found it unusually quiet for a weekend. On Mr Tan’s floor, where there are eight units, he said only his was occupied. \nAs this TODAY reporter travelled across the vast expanse of Forest City via an hourly shuttle bus, only one other passenger boarded it. \nThere were some signs of life at Forest City’s transport hub, though, where one can find a good mix of restaurants, retail shops, and a convenience mart open for business. Still, some shop lots were either closed or boarded up, awaiting prospective tenants. \nNotwithstanding the controversies and rather muted environment, Mr Tan said he is happy with his decision to buy a Forest City unit as he believes in the project’s potential. He also found himself drawn to the “modern city design”. \nForest City also appeals to Malaysian workers who work in Singapore, as rental prices are reasonable. Among its residents is Mr Afiq Alwi, a 40-year-old truck driver who is currently renting a 600 sq ft unit with two bedrooms for RM1,000. \nHe said that the rate at Forest City was cheaper compared with units for rent in nearby towns in Iskandar Puteri, such as Gelang Patah: “For the same unit, I’d be paying RM1,600 there.” \n“I like working in Singapore, but it’s expensive to live there because one room can cost minimally S$700 to S$800. For less than that price in ringgit, I can comfortably rent an entire unit all to myself here.” \nSix property agents TODAY spoke to said that while a significant number of Singaporeans are looking to buy Johor homes for investment, there are also those looking to live there or have a second home. \nOperations director Victor Lee, 53, and his wife Crystal Wang, 38, are among the latter. When TODAY met the couple on May 15, they had just collected the keys to their two-bedroom unit at R&F Princess Cove, a condominium project said to be popular among Singaporean buyers.  \nMr Lee said they paid for the RM800,000, 834 sq ft unit in full, using cash.\nThanks to a flexi-work arrangement — he can spend one or two days working from home each week — Mr Lee, who is in the energy sector, said he is happy with the purchase.\n“R&F is near my workplace in Admiralty West. You can see it from my balcony. So geographically, I’m at an advantage,” he said. \nAsked if he would brave the notorious congestion on the Causeway several times a week, Mr Lee said there have been promising improvements, with both governments constantly making efforts to smoothen the travel process, such as the recent implementation of electronic gates. \n“There are pros and cons. If you live in Singapore, the major expressways are always jammed, and there’s ERP (Electronic Road Pricing) to consider. It’s a trade-off I can live with.”  \nBefore buying this Johor house, the couple had been renting a studio unit in Singapore for S$2,000 monthly. Mr Lee also owns an HDB flat where his parents live.\n“We decided to look to JB and thought, instead of renting, why don’t we put our money into a place we can call our own?” he said. \nOn safety concerns in Johor Bahru, Mr Lee said he would do his best to take precautions, such as avoiding going out alone at night and in dark alleyways.\nA Singaporean father of two, who wanted to be known only as Mr Afiq for privacy reasons (not to be confused with Mr Afiq Alwi above), is looking to buy a property in Johor within the next 12 months.\nFor the last six months, he has been renting a 1,500 sq ft double-storey terrace house in Horizon Hills, Iskandar Puteri, with his wife and two kids, aged six and nine, for RM3,500 a month, and he likes the lifestyle there. \nMr Afiq, who works in finance, said before moving there, he had been entertaining the thought of relocating to Johor as he can work remotely most of the time. \nIt was when his wife decided to quit her job as an agricultural scientist to recover from burnout that he mooted the idea and she agreed. \n“One main reason that pushed me to move my family here was so that I could send my kids to an international school, where they get to learn Chinese as a required subject and socialise in a melting pot of different nationalities,” he said. \nThe difference in cost of living was another push factor, as Mr Afiq is currently spending S$20,000 a year on his kids’ education. If he were to do the same in Singapore, he estimated that he would easily be paying twice or thrice that amount. \n“At this point, I can confidently say that we plan to move to Johor for the long term. Unless there are big regulatory changes, we'll probably live in Johor for the next two to five years.” \nRegarding security, Mr Afiq said every city or state has different security standards in different areas, and the same goes for Johor. \n“I know from my Malaysian friends that certain areas in Johor are considerably poorer, where the likelihood of you being robbed or your car being broken into is quite high. \n“But that’s why staying in a gated community helps. My family and I are also not flashy people. I own a cheap entry-level local car so that we can get around easily. We try to avoid unsafe areas.” \nIn contrast to those who bought the apartments to live in, the picture is less rosy for investors including those who entered the Johor property market 10 years ago.  \nA supply chain manager who wished to be known only as Mr Lee invested in a property the same year as Mr Sim, the author who sold off his units at a loss.\nMr Lee bought an RM1.7 million double-story cluster house in Horizon Hills. The 2,514 sq ft house has five bedrooms and five bathrooms, and he financed the purchase with a bank loan. \n“The Johor property market was booming, so my friends also bought properties in Johor as investments. I expected to be able to sell my house within five years and make a profit due to capital appreciation,” said the 40-year-old. \nHowever, things did not go as planned. In his view, the launch of Forest City “killed the property market”. \n“There’s an oversupply of units because of the project. We did not expect the developers from China to come in that fast. If I were to sell now, I would be looking at a loss,” said Mr Lee. \n“I kind of regret buying the property because I could have put the money to better use. If given a choice, I wouldn’t have done it.” \nMr Lee told TODAY that he is still holding onto his unit. He hopes the newly announced plans, such as the Singapore-Johor Special Economic Zone (SEZ) and RTS Link, would eventually drive up demand and prices. \nMr Sim said most buyers, like himself, tend to get caught up in thinking that buying property in Johor is lucrative simply because “the psf (price per square foot) is so cheap... cheaper than HDB.” \nBut he said there are other factors to consider. For example, in Singapore condominiums, units typically require “some curtains and lights” before being deemed viable for rental, he noted. \n“But in Malaysia, it’s not like that. You need to do up the cabinet and kitchen, not just curtains and lights. So, with everything considered, I would need to spend about RM80,000 for my units just to get them in good condition before renting them out. \n“So I thought I might as well not rent them out because it would jeopardise my chances of selling the units off eventually,” he said. \nDespite stories like Mr Lee's and Mr Sim's, overall demand for Johor property has stayed strong.\nData from Malaysia’s Napic shows that the property price index for Johor state, which was given a value of 100 in the base year of 2010, soared to 313.3 in 2023, which means prices more than tripled on average.\nThe increase is more drastic for Johor Bahru, as the price index stands at 400 in 2023, from the same base year value of 100. \nIn Singapore, based on the Urban Redevelopment Authority Realis data, the property price index climbed from 125.1 in the first quarter of 2010 to 204 in the first quarter of this year, a 63 per cent increase. \nMeanwhile, PropertyGuru Singapore country manager Dr Tan Tee Khoon said that as of April this year, demand for residential homes in Johor Bahru recorded an increase of “close to three times” since October 2019. \nThis is based on the firm’s \"demand index\", which calculates the number of visitors to property listings, weighted by their engagement and search behaviour. \nThe demand index for residential homes for rent in Johor Bahru also experienced a significant jump after the reopening of the Johor-Singapore border in February 2022, he said, and since then, rental demand has remained largely stable.\nUsing asking prices for service residences as a proxy for price movement, the median psf was RM488.75 as of April 2024, up from RM397.35 in March 2022, he said, adding that this was also higher than the pre-Covid median price of RM449.07 psf. \n“Notably, nearly 44 per cent of property seekers looking for a residential property in Johor Bahru in April 2024 were from Singapore.”\nDr Tan cited several reasons that contributed to this, such as the full reopening of the Republic’s international borders on April 1, 2022, which significantly boosted the demand for homes in Johor Bahru, particularly among Malaysians working in Singapore. \n“High rents and a strong Singaporean currency make owning a home in Johor Bahru more attractive. Additionally, the announcement of the SEZ and RTS further drove up rental prices.” \nMr Faizul Ridzuan, chief executive officer of property investment firm Far Capital, agreed.\n“In Singapore, property values have gone up by 30 to 40 per cent in 24 months. After Covid, rentals have gone up by 60 per cent,” he told TODAY. \n“There’s nothing new or sexy about Johor. It’s been like this for years. This time around, the primary push factors are coming from Singapore, as the cost of living has gone up substantially in the last 12 to 24 months, forcing people to look for cheaper alternatives, along with the devaluation of the Malaysian ringgit against SGD.” \nReal estate negotiator Edward Lee said Singapore’s housing policies, which levy a higher stamp duty on second and subsequent properties, also contributed to the increase in demand. \n“Once the RTS is completed, I believe property prices will be even higher than today,” he added. \nThe hot Johor property market has led some to wonder whether there would be any spillover effect on the prices of HDB flats at housing estates near the Woodlands Checkpoint, like Woodlands town itself.\nBut Ms Wong Siew Ying, head of research and content at PropNex Realty, said she believes that the HDB prices and rental trends in Woodlands generally align with overall market movement in Singapore, rather than specific locational attributes. \n“That said, transaction activity, particularly HDB resale and rental activity, has been gaining some traction recently for Woodlands town,” she said. \nThe HDB resale volume in Woodlands has seen a year-on-year increase since 2021. In 2022, there was a year-on-year increase of 14.2 per cent, while 2023 recorded a 10 per cent jump. \nMs Wong said that this can be attributed to overall improvements in infrastructure and ongoing efforts to transform the estate into a commercial hub, which has helped boost the quality of life and employment opportunities within the area.\n“The recent opening of the Thomson-East Coast Line has also greatly improved connectivity... Proximity to well-established amenities such as schools, malls, and the Causeway are all perks that further boost its popularity among residents.” \nAll things considered, is investing in a property in Johor a worthwhile investment? Property experts and homeowners advise prospective buyers to do their homework thoroughly before making a decision. \nMr Sim, the former investment banker, said one should refrain from following investment trends without research.\n“If I could turn back time, I would do a little more research on the economic activities in the area. I would also check the housing supply – not the number of units available at that point in time, but the amount of land and whether property developers would build more.\n“If I had done my homework back in 2014, I would've found information that other developers had plans to go big,” he said, referring to Forest City. \nReal estate agent Ryan Khoo, who deals with properties in Johor, said it's a good idea to look into the developer’s background before making a purchase. \n“Look for reputable ones that are publicly listed and have solid track records. For example, they have built existing projects in Johor or other parts of Malaysia that you can visit.” \nMr Faizul of Far Capital stressed the importance of looking at a property in Malaysia through the lens of a local, instead of a Singaporean.\n“When you use a Singaporean mindset to buy a property in Johor, it's suicidal,” he said, since the buyer may end up overpaying for their purchase. \nIllustrating his point, Mr Faizul said the average property price in Johor 10 years ago, including high-rise and landed units, was about RM300,000. \n“When Singaporeans come in, they pay way more than that. Perhaps over RM500,000 to RM1 million, whereas the average local only pays RM300,000. When you overpay, the probability of profit will be greatly reduced.” \nWhen investing based on the potential of future infrastructure and amenities, Mr Faizul advised prospective buyers to be patient and only make the move when there is concrete movement for the projects.  \n“Like the RTS, when you see movements from both governments, then you know for sure it won’t be cancelled. (Wait until things are) built first, instead of investing during the talking stage.\n“I’ll give you an analogy. You commit to someone who is serious about you. Just because your friend comes and tells you about this person who is ideal, rich, and good-looking, it doesn’t mean you stop doing your due diligence, and marry the person straight away, right?”\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this article said that Dr Tan Tee Khoon was the country manager of PropertyGuru Malaysia. He is the country manager of PropertyGuru Singapore. We are sorry for the error."

            "Article Summary": "A yearning for better work-life balance and flexible work arrangements has increasingly become a norm in Singapore.\nHowever, this has also reignited debate over whether these are too much to ask for, with some employers saying that they may even rethink hiring local staff.\nWorkers and experts interviewed by TODAY laid out some factors behind the growing demand for work-life harmony and debunked the notion that this speaks of a workforce which lacks hunger or is uncompetitive.\nEmployers meanwhile spoke about the challenges they face in navigating this new landscape.\nThey added that building a culture of mutual trust and open communication with their employees would be key to a smooth transition",
            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — For new mother Nur Sabrina Muhleseddin, being able to enjoy work-life balance is something she values in a job, as it allows her to be present for her son’s milestones.\nThe 29-year-old digital marketing manager said her priorities have shifted since she gave birth in July last year. She was working in a different company previously, but had sought out a new role four months after becoming a mother.\nBeing able to balance work with caring for her son is especially important to Ms Nur Sabrina, whose husband works in the hospitality industry as a shift manager — often having to work irregular hours and on weekends.\nHer flexible work post-pregnancy would mean that at least one of them — herself or her husband — can be present for their child, she said.\nCurrently, she works almost entirely from home, save for a few in-person meetings with her clients at their offices about once or twice a week.\n“I think presently, nothing is more important than to be able to witness my son growing up and being around for his milestones.\n“I’ve had a good few years of working up the ladder. Right now, I just need a job so that I can provide food on the table and share the bills with my husband,” said Ms Nur Sabrina.\nEchoing her sentiments is 29-year-old Ms Chua, who works in a human resource software company.\nThe marketing specialist, who declined to give her full name to prevent identification by her employer, started her career in a public relations agency which “didn’t provide for much work-life balance.”\n“I felt it was really tiring not only at work, but it also fed off my energy with my friends and family as well, and I didn’t have the capacity to do that.”\nAs such, when she was looking for a new job, Ms Chua hunted specifically for roles that could give her the work-life balance she was seeking.\nToday, Ms Chua is employed by an Australian company, which allows her to perform her role 100 per cent remotely from Singapore.\nMs Chua, who is married, said she is hoping to also start a family in the future, so having such flexibility is crucial to her.\nTo her, being able to be present — not just at work, but also with her friends and family — is key to building an all-round holistic life, she added.\nThe approach embraced by Ms Nur Sabrina and Ms Chua reflects a growing shift among Singapore workers towards prioritising work-life balance — with many recognising that work is not everything, along with a desire to also spend more time on personal pursuits.\nAlluding to this shift in a speech after being sworn in as Singapore’s fourth prime minister on Wednesday (May 15), Mr Lawrence Wong said: “They (younger Singaporeans) will strive and work hard for their goals, but they do not wish to be trapped in an endless rat race of hyper-competition.\n“They want a refreshed Singapore Dream — one that is not defined by material success alone, but also offers meaning and purpose in their careers and lives.”\nHe added that the Government would thus find “new ways to be productive and innovative”, and to help a new generation of workers “achieve a better balance where work is purposeful, and life is meaningful”.\nOne of the ways this is being explored is through flexible work options, which allow employees to carve out a suitable work-life rhythm tailored to their individual needs at different life stages.\nFrom December this year, all firms in Singapore will be required to have a formal process in place for their employees to request for flexible working arrangements.\nThe release of the guidelines last month has also reignited debate on the issue of work-life balance and flexible work, which has long attracted polarising sentiments — even to the extent of some questioning whether Singapore workers have increasingly lost their hunger and drive.\nIn the wake of the announcement, some employers had also come out to say that they may even rethink hiring local staff, and instead look overseas for recruitment.\nSpeaking to TODAY, Mr Suhaimi Salleh, chief executive officer of consultancy and professional training firm SSA Group, said it is crucial to consider the “broader implications” of demanding better work-life balance and flexible work arrangements, especially in a globalised job market.\n“If local employees insist on full flexibility for roles that can be equally efficiently performed remotely by workers in lower-cost locations like Manila, they may inadvertently pit themselves against foreign talents who can accept lower salaries.\n“This scenario could potentially disadvantage local applicants, as the cost of employing a similarly qualified individual in Manila may be significantly lower than employing a Singaporean for the same role,” he added.\nThe debate also begs the broader question: In resource-scarce Singapore, is it too much for employees to seek a better quality of life by way of better work-life balance?\nOr must its workforce — as the nation’s prime resource — remain in a perpetual state of being “kiasu” (Singlish for “scared to lose”), for fear of others stealing its rice bowl and Singapore’s labour force ultimately losing its competitive edge?\nRecent surveys have found a growing expectation among the Singapore workforce for greater work-life balance.\nA survey done by recruitment firm Randstad in 2023 found that more respondents are prioritising work-life balance over salary: Ninety-five per cent of Singapore workers said that having work-life balance is important to them in their current and future jobs, compared to 90 per cent who said pay is important.\nHuman resource and sociology experts told TODAY that while the Covid-19 pandemic may have accelerated the demand for better work-life balance and flexible work as more employees recognise the feasibility of such arrangements, the growing expectation for work-life balance is ultimately not a new phenomenon.\nAssociate Professor Tan Ern Ser, a sociologist from National University of Singapore (NUS), said that even before working from home became a feature of the new post-pandemic work norm, there has been a “silent but significant value shift towards prioritising work autonomy and quality of life” — and, in turn, work-life balance — with Singapore becoming a more affluent, post-materialist society.\nDr Shannon Ang, an assistant professor of sociology at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), said that the contradictions of constantly prioritising economic growth over “life” also gradually get brought to the forefront, or become more acute, as societies develop.\nIn the past, he noted, “we were told we needed to work hard, because Singapore’s place in the world should not be taken for granted, and that we could lose it all if we gave it less than our very best”.\nHowever, the slower economic growth Singapore sees today compared to the past could prompt a new generation of workers to feel like it is “less ‘worth it’ to keep pursuing economic growth”, as they do not enjoy the same extent of progress.\n“Older cohorts saw palpable change in their living conditions for the sacrifices that they made. Younger cohorts are unlikely to see the same kind of progress, and are probably quickly realising it may be better to invest their time in pursuits that seem more meaningful to them,” said Dr Ang.\nAt the same time, experts also cautioned against the general tendency to assume that the desire for work-life balance is mainly confined to a younger generation of workers.  \nInstead of couching it as an issue that later-born cohorts are “spoilt and cannot take hard work anymore”, Dr Ang suggested that work-life balance could have become more sought after in recent times due to other factors at play.\nFor example, the growing number of dual-earner couples means that work-life balance may be harder to achieve because there is no longer one person in the family dedicated to doing the household tasks or providing childcare.\nAs an ageing society, Singaporeans are also living longer. At the same time, shrinking family sizes mean care responsibilities are shared among fewer children, and more time may need to be devoted to caregiving or coordinating care for an older parent, said Dr Ang.\nThese societal changes could have also prompted a greater cry for work-life balance over the years.\nAgreeing, Mr Richard Bradshaw, the Asia chief executive officer of recruitment consultancy Ethos BeathChapman, said better work-life balance has grown to be a “common requirement” across different working demographics and ages today, and to some extent, may even be perceived as a form of “basic workers’ rights”.\nThis was something which resonated with 47-year-old father of three Edwin Ho.\nThe senior associate director at Finexis Advisory, who wants to be actively involved in helping his three teenage children to navigate their life stages, said this consideration was among the factors that motivated him to switch from working as an engineer in the Republic of Singapore Air Force to his current career in personal finance. \nBeing in the personal finance industry has allowed him the flexibility to work from home and also plan his own appointments with clients.\n“Ideally we would all like to have work-life balance, but we have different needs at different times. To find balance between work and personal life, we have to constantly make the necessary adjustments to make it happen,” Mr Ho said.\nLikewise, Ms Samantha Ong, 36, told TODAY that her approach towards work is to work harder while she is young, so she would be able to retire earlier.\n“When I had children, I shifted my priorities. I need to work hard for my family — providing financial security yet at the same time spending quality time with the children when they are young,” said Ms Ong.\nThe marketing campaign manager at technology firm Telstra International has two young children aged two and four years old.\n“It requires a delicate balance, smart planning and often a good support system,” she added.\n“You have to accept that there is no ‘perfect’ work-life balance — it’s more important to strive for a realistic schedule instead of a perfect one. Some days, I might focus more on work, while on other days I spend more time and energy on hobbies like working out or being with loved ones.”\nWith more people yearning for better work-life balance, the million-dollar question is whether, from employers’ point of view, it is too much to ask for.\nWhile they understand the desire for better work-life balance and integration, some employers, especially those in the services industries, told TODAY that it is difficult to accede to employees’ requests, given the nature of their role and industry.\nGenerational gaps may also play a part in influencing the success of flexible work arrangements.\nMr Jianhan Qiu, principal for strategy and change in Asia at strategy, design, and construction firm Unispace Singapore, said that younger Gen Zers may be more accustomed to operating virtually compared to their older colleagues. \n“This generational gap influences managerial approaches to hybrid meetings and mentorship which might contradict flexible work arrangements. Managers who favour face-to-face interactions may inadvertently pressure remote employees to be in the office more to avoid missing out on career development opportunities.”\nAdditionally, some roles and industries may be better suited to flexible work that could afford its employees better work-life balance, simply due to their nature of work.\nMr Kenji Naito, group chief executive officer at recruitment agency Reeracoen, said that sectors such as technology, or creative and professional services, tend to demonstrate greater openness to flexible work.\nConversely, industries with stringent operational requirements or client-facing roles may find it more challenging to implement such arrangements, he said.\nMr Salim Radiman, a business development manager and assistant general manager at a cleaning services company, said: “It is quite difficult for us to have that flexible work environment, because...we have to provide manpower to ensure that daily operations are being deployed according to the (client’s) contract.”\nHe added that Singaporeans tend to shun work in the cleaning as well as food industries because of its long hours and the need to work on public holidays and weekends.\n“That’s why in my kind of industry, we have to hire Chinese workers, Malaysian workers, Myanmar workers, and Filipino workers. For them, they come to Singapore and their mindset is to work and earn a living for their family, so their commitment is different from the locals.”\nAsked about these concerns of employers who may rethink hiring local staff and instead look overseas for recruitment, particularly given the difference in costs, Minister of State for Manpower Gan Siow Huang said last month that the competitiveness of Singapore’s workforce was key.\nLocal workers must have in-demand skills and be able to meet business productivity needs. They must also remain competitive in their work ethic or “the softer things, like being reliable, trusted”, which are attributes of the local workforce that businesses appreciate, she said.\nSpeaking in Parliament earlier this month, she also reiterated that remote work and outsourcing are already global trends regardless of Singapore’s guidelines.\n“Even if foreigners are not working in Singapore... they will still be competing with us when working in companies overseas.”\nInstead, it was more important for local workers to continually upskill and stay productive to compete for jobs not just in Singapore, but globally, she added.\nDoes this mean, however, that Singapore workers need to work hard over long hours to retain their competitive edge?\nNot so, said the experts interviewed, who pointed out that competitiveness is multi-faceted, and prioritising work-life balance does not have to come at the expense of a workforce’s attractiveness or economic progress.\nIn 2022, the BBC reported that Norway and Denmark had work weeks that were shorter than 40 hours, yet were respectively the second- and seventh-most productive countries in the world then.\nFor one thing, what workers may lose out on in absolute hours put into work can be made up for in other ways, such as increased productivity during the actual time they are at their jobs.\nAssociate Professor Nicholas Sim, from the Singapore University of Social Sciences’ (SUSS) School of Business, said: “While there are trade-offs between competitiveness and work-life balance, it is not necessarily true that work-life balance must be sacrificed to increase competitiveness, particularly if this refers to an increase in productivity.”\nHe added that the assumption that one must work longer hours to be more competitive is often “unfounded”.\nHighlighting findings from studies which surveyed respondents of various occupations and skill levels, Assoc Prof Sim said that working beyond a certain threshold of hours may in fact increase errors and decrease one’s productivity.\n“Moreover, many studies have also consistently shown that poorer employee well-being is associated with increased disengagement and intentions to quit.\n“A hyper-competitive corporate culture may also foster toxic work environments that ultimately undermines productivity.”\nAgreeing, Dr Kelvin Seah, an economist at NUS, said that what is more important is to assess not only the quantity, but also the quality of time spent at work.\nTo this end, having greater work-life balance may actually improve one’s output.\n“If employees feel happier and less stressed at work, they may be able to think of better ideas, be more efficient and engaged at work, and perform better at their jobs,” he added.\nAgreeing, Ms Cassandra Loh, vice-president of partnerships and solutions at mental health start-up Intellect, said she believes companies should instead be more “results-oriented”.\nShe also does not believe that having work-life balance is necessarily in conflict with also working hard.\n“I always believe that if one has ownership and takes pride in their work, whatever the work might be, work will still get done (within) deadlines.”\nWork-life balance or flexibility just helps the worker schedule their day better, she added. \nFor Ms Loh, who is a mother to two young children aged one-and-a-half and five years old, this could look like trying to be home by 7pm to spend time with her kids, before returning to focus on her work at 10pm after they go to sleep.\nOther employees TODAY spoke to also disagree with the notion that those who yearn for work-life balance are less hungry for success.\nMr Ho from Finexis Advisory said that a person who devotes equal amounts of time to work and personal life can be more successful, productive and fulfilling, than a person who only works hard and spends huge amounts of time at work while sacrificing other matters in life, like spending time with family and friends or travelling.\n“To me, working hard and being successful does not mean simply attaining some professional or work-related goals. It means putting in quality effort to learn from experiences every day...and using less time to achieve one’s targets and goals.\n“I think we first must define (our) purpose for working hard and what success is, so that we can work towards that goal and in doing so, learn to find a balance between work and personal life.”\nAgreeing, Mr Jivan Tulsiani, the head of marketing at blockchain firm TZ APAC, said that a growing demand for work-life balance does not reflect a lack of hunger from employees.\n“It's more of a shift in how ambitious professionals define success. It's important to understand the concept of purpose, which is an aggregate of components such as talent, passion, skills, occupation, charity and service,” he said.\n“Professionals are able to satisfy some of these components in their jobs, but are also willing to make time for other priorities outside of work to fulfil their purposes.”\nMr Tulsiani has observed that newer generations of workers are “very intentional about their passions”.\nSome employers who recognise the need to afford their employees greater work-life harmony say that they have such employees who are high achievers.\nMr Winthrop Wong, co-founder and pharmacist at e-pharmacy Glovida-Rx, said this is the case of some of its medical sales staff. \n“We set them qualitative and quantitative goals on a yearly and monthly basis and if they are able to achieve these targets, we basically allow them to schedule their days in what is most productive to them.”\nExperts interviewed by TODAY also pointed out that offering greater work-life balance and flexible work arrangements could even attract additional groups of workers — who are otherwise unable to contribute to the workforce if they had to adhere strictly to traditional work settings and hours — into the market.\nDr Ang from NTU said: “We tend to focus on the people who are currently working, and act as if they are trying to skive off by asking for more work-life balance.\n“What we probably miss, are the people for whom a better work-life balance will allow (them) to work, for those whom it will allow to work longer or more sustainably (such as older persons, or those with health conditions), and so on.\n“Much depends on whether employers are creative enough to tap such people by adapting their own processes or (possibly outmoded) ways of thinking.”\nAmid a push for better work-life balance and flexible work arrangements even as Singapore strives to maintain its competitive edge, both employers and employees will have their work cut out for them in navigating this new landscape.\nFor a prospective employee, expressing a desire for greater work-life balance by way of flexible work arrangements — especially at the job interview stage — may work against the candidate, if the employer does not have such work arrangements in place, said Mr Suhaimi of SSA Group.\nAt the same time, employers who do not offer such flexible work arrangements may also find themselves at a disadvantage in attracting and retaining talent, especially as workers’ expectations for work-life balance continue to evolve, he said.\nThis is also a point that Manpower Minister Tan See Leng has made in explaining the rationale of flexible work arrangements. \nWith corporate information on pay, benefits, and culture becoming more transparent and widely available across prospective employers and employees, Mr Qiu from Unispace Singapore said that companies will need to adapt to attract and retain talent.\nOver time, this would leave the organisations’ approach towards work-life balance and flexible work to be the main differentiator.\nWhile employers interviewed by TODAY acknowledged the benefits greater work-life balance had on employee engagement, talent attraction and retention, they also raised concerns.\nOne challenge flagged by several employers includes the difficulty of monitoring employees’ productivity and performance when they work remotely or are operating on flexible schedules.\nOther concerns include potential impacts on business operations and stakeholder relationships, ensuring fair team workload distribution, and any associated costs, said Ms Khew Shu Ping, deputy managing director of public relations agency Tate Anzur.\nAsked what an optimal balance to strike between work-life balance and an economy’s performance could look like in Singapore’s context, Dr Ang from NTU said this balance would differ for each person at each stage of life.\n“This means we will need to create room for people to strike these different balances without feeling like they cannot survive.”\nTo do this necessitates a mindset shift from being a “market society” — driven by economic logic on who is worthy of respect and what is worth striving for — to that of a “market economy”, where the economy is simply a tool for exchange and society decides what it values and how to thus make the market work for it, said Dr Ang.\nUltimately, the transition towards fully embracing greater work-life balance — premised on a mindset of results-oriented work — will require cultural and mindset shifts, which would take time, said experts.\nCiting studies on how culture tends to be highly persistent, Assoc Prof Sim from SUSS said that it is very unlikely for there to be an organic shift towards a culture of measuring performance by output, unless there are some external macroeconomic or policy shocks, similar to Covid-19.\nNotwithstanding that, employers told TODAY that building a culture of mutual trust and open communication with their employees would be key to a smooth transition and moving the needle.\nFor one thing, employees are encouraged to clearly define their needs and the specific type of flexible work arrangement they’re seeking, said Ms Khew from Tate Anzur.\n“As part of their application, they can submit a well-defined plan outlining how their flexible work arrangement will be implemented,” she added.\nThis plan should address how their workload will be covered during their absence, how they will stay connected and maintain proactive communication, and their commitment to continually deliver high-quality work.\nThese go a long way in showing that employees can manage the responsibility of flexi-work arrangements, said Mr Danny Tan, managing director of public relations agency Grayling Singapore.\nOther ways this is evident are in areas such as employees’ timeliness — as seen from their punctuality for work and in keeping to deadlines — and their overall performance at work.\n“If they have performance issues, it is unlikely that they will be considered for flexi-work arrangements,” said Mr Tan.\nThe agency currently operates on a 4.5-day work week that is extended to all employees who have spent more than a year with the firm.\nAgreeing, Mr Wong from Glovida-Rx said employers will be more likely to accede to requests for better work-life balance or flexi-work arrangements from workers with a good track record.\n“We build a culture of trust over a period of time.”\nBeyond building trust between employers and employees, Mr Wong said it is important to also foster a good working culture among employees themselves.\nOffering select employees flexi-work options and better work-life balance takes “great communication” from the employer — in that the company’s management must be clear on the parameters not only with the employees involved, but also with their team about why the arrangements are in place.\nCommunicating clearly, and being open to questions, will thus help prevent any feelings of resentment between team members or concerns that there is some bias in an organisation, he added.\nStill, these are all worthy adjustments to be made as employers and employees alike navigate what could be the next new normal.\nMr Tulsiani of TZ APAC said: “The lines between work and personal life are not as clear as it was before: Professionals today view their occupation as an important piece of a jigsaw puzzle that embodies their purpose in life. \n“It is one of the many priorities they devote their attention to, in addition to family, health, passion, service, charity, talent development and more.\n“Putting their employees’ purposes at the forefront of policy making will (thus) be key to retaining and attracting the best people, which is the lifeblood of any organisation.”"

            "Article Body": "Each week, TODAY’s long-running Big Read series delves into the trends and issues that matter. This week, we look at whether progress has been made in Singapore's push to reduce use of single-use plastics and disposables. This is a shortened version of the full feature, which can be found here.\nSINGAPORE — Before she leaves home, Ms Cha Yoo Kyung, 27, always makes sure she has three essential items with her: A food container, cutlery and a reusable shopping bag.\nShe uses them to pack her lunch every day from coffee shops and hawker centres near her office, as part of a conscious effort to cut down on single-use plastic waste. \n“I’ve cultivated this habit for about five years now, and it’s mainly thanks to my mum. She takes active steps to minimise unnecessary use of plastic, and she’s been carrying an eco bag to get groceries for as long as I can remember,” said the Singapore permanent resident, who works as a writer.\nAsked if it was difficult to change her behaviour or to maintain it, Ms Cha said no.\n“It’s like trying to drink more water throughout the day. You just have to remind yourself and translate that thought into action constantly,” she said. \nMs Cha is part of a growing minority of people here who strive to do more for the environment by reducing the use of single-use disposables and plastics in their everyday lives. \nHawker centres, as ubiquitous as they are here, have also taken baby steps to become greener. \nWhen Bukit Canberra Hawker Centre opened in December 2022, it made the news for its aim to be one of the greenest hawker centres in Singapore.\nAmong other things, its 44 stalls do not use disposable cutlery for dining in. For takeaways, they use only biodegradable containers or paper bags and boxes, instead of plastic ones.\nStill, some diners quickly complained about having to fork out 80 cents for biodegradable containers, underlying the challenge of getting more Singaporeans to embrace sustainability. \nThat reportedly prompted the operator to then stipulate that stall owners are to charge no more than 30 cents for these containers. This practice is still in place, hawkers there told TODAY this week. \nHowever, this also means that some hawkers have to subsidise the cost of the containers, as they said their actual cost is at least S$0.50 per container. \nSimilar consumer complaints surfaced earlier this month — over homegrown bakery brand BreadTalk’s implementation of a S$0.10 charge per disposable plastic carrier bag as well as a S$0.50 charge for a woven carrier bag by American footwear store Skechers.\nWhile some consumers support such moves to cut waste, others question if these practices are actually “greenwashing” and aimed at helping retailers increase their profits.\nPlastic is the fourth highest type of waste generated in Singapore, with one million tonnes of plastic waste generated in 2022, according to the National Environment Agency (NEA). \nThis translates to 177kg of plastic waste per capita in 2022, a 17 per cent increase from the 145kg per capita in 2017. \nOnly 6 per cent of plastic waste is recycled. The remaining 944,000 tonnes, comprising single-use and reusable plastics, are disposed of. \nNEA’s website also states that in 2020, about 200,000 tonnes of domestic waste were single-use disposables, comprising both packaging and non-packaging items such as carrier bags, food and beverage containers, as well as tableware and utensils.\nIt also stated that, based on the current rate of waste generation, Singapore’s only landfill, Semakau Landfill, is projected to be fully filled by 2035, so reducing the use of single-use disposable items will help reduce waste generation.\nIn recent years, both the authorities and environmental groups have launched various initiatives to nudge people to cut down on single-use plastics and disposables.\nThese initiatives include:  \nThe various moves have moved the needle in changing consumer behaviour in some aspects.\nIn January this year, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu said the number of plastic bags used at large supermarkets had dropped by 50 to 80 per cent since the mandatory minimum charge of five cents kicked in. \nFor a retiree who wanted to be known only as Mrs Nathan, the shift towards eco-living started three years ago. \nCarrying a reusable bag at a FairPrice supermarket, the 65-year-old told TODAY that her children persuaded her to stop using plastic bags to “save the animals”. She would also bring tiffin carriers when the family eats out in case there is unfinished food. \nHowever, hawkers and other retailers told TODAY they have seen little change in consumer behaviour, as they have not observed any significant increase in customers bringing their own containers. \nThose working at several bubble tea stalls, including Chi Cha San Chen, LiHo, and The Alley, said while they welcome customers who bring their own cups, they normally see such individuals fewer than five times a week. \nThe situation is also similar at food outlets such as Old Chang Kee, Dough Culture, and Jian Bo Shui Kueh, as well as bakeries nestled in public housing blocks. \n“Most people in Singapore, both consumers and businesses, are driven by dollars and cents — what is the cheapest and most convenient — and rarely by altruistic reasons,” said Ms Lin Qinghui, founder of social enterprise D2L.sg, a one-stop food surplus and waste manager.\n“The culture here is to throw things away. It’s all about convenience, and it’s hard to change this because it’s ingrained in Singaporean society.” \nMr Rayson Lim, 27, who is unemployed, said he did try to pick up the habit of bringing his own container out for four to five months in 2022. Eventually, he stopped because he gave in to his laziness in washing the container after eating each time. \nCivil servant Shafiq Ahmad, 29, echoed Mr Lim’s sentiments. “I haven’t tried bringing my own container before, but just the thought of doing the washing after eating makes me feel it’s tiring and troublesome.” \nAmidst the push to use less disposable plastic in everyday life, some companies have jumped on the bandwagon through moves such as charging for plastic bags and switching from conventional plastic bags or packaging to those using biodegradable plastic or paper and other non-plastic materials. \nHowever, there has also been debate on whether some of these practices constitute greenwashing. \nFor example, consumers have taken to forums to talk about how a certain health and beauty retailer has started charging for plastic bags but still uses plenty of plastic for its in-house water products. \nAnother discussion involved a food court that removed plastic straws but introduced cups with plastic caps for cold drinks, which sell for at least S$2. \nA consumer pointed out that cold drinks cost about S$1.40 a cup before the change. \nSome questioned whether the amount of plastic used for the cap is less than that of a straw, and whether this is just a gimmick to increase profit. \nOthers asked if paper or cloth alternatives for disposable plastics used by some retailers are actually more environmentally friendly.  \nMs Lin, the environmentalist, cautioned against advocating for non-plastic alternatives without considering Singapore’s “unique” waste management system, where all trash goes to the incinerator.\nHence, she said plastics are efficiently incinerated, potentially reducing their harmful effects compared with countries relying on landfills.\nConversely, some other materials used to replace plastic come at a higher environmental cost as they might not burn as efficiently or as cleanly as plastic. \n“Plastic is not environmentally friendly, but if you look at the life cycle analysis across these materials, it’s the lesser evil because the alternatives, like woven cloth, fabric, cardboard, and paper, could actually bring more harm by leaving a larger carbon footprint,\" said Ms Lin.\nA life cycle assessment is a comprehensive method used to evaluate the environmental impacts of a product or service throughout its entire life cycle.\nIt considers various environmental factors, such as energy consumption, resource depletion, emissions to air, water, and soil, and waste generation at each stage of the product's life.\nOn NEA's website, in explaining why Singapore does not ban single-use plastics, the agency said that doing so may lead to a switch to disposables made from other materials such as paper or degradable plastics, “which also create waste, have their own set of environmental impacts and are not necessarily better for the environment”. \n“In view of the above, instead of advocating a switch to degradable materials, Singapore’s approach is to reduce the use of disposables regardless of material type, and promote the use of reusables.”\nSimilarly, Mr Yasser Amin, who heads Stridy, a non-profit organisation addressing urban waste management issues worldwide, said terms such as “biodegradable” or “compostable” often confuse the average person. \n“It's like a marketing tactic,” said Mr Yasser. He cited how some coffee and cafe chains switched from plastic to compostable straws, when these may not be the more environmentally friendly option.\n“Companies should be more aware and capable of conducting life cycle assessments to determine the true environmental impact of their alternatives. People need to question company claims more thoroughly.” \nIn response to TODAY’s queries on legislation or guidelines to tackle greenwashing, a spokesperson for the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore said that it is currently developing a guide to provide greater clarity to businesses on sustainability claims. \nIt will share more details in due course, the spokesperson added."

This was also the biggest volume in the Asia-Pacific region. \nNEA said on its website that with Singapore’s only landfill, Semakau Landfill, projected to be fully filled by 2035 based on current rate of waste generation, reducing the use of single-use disposable items will help cut waste generation.\nIn recent years, both the authorities and environmental groups have launched various initiatives to nudge people to cut down on single-use plastics and disposables.\nThese initiatives include:  \nThe various moves have moved the needle in changing consumer behaviour in some aspects.\nIn January this year, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu said the number of plastic bags used at large supermarkets had dropped by 50 to 80 per cent since the mandatory minimum charge of five cents kicked in. \nIn response to TODAY's queries, a BreadTalk Group spokesperson said its S$0.10 charge for plastic bags implemented on April 1 has reduced such usage across its BreadTalk stores by 65 per cent. \n“We have also observed a notable increase in customers bringing their own bags to the store when purchasing our products,” she said.\n“To encourage greater adoption of this initiative, we provide customers with the option to have their bun purchases taped up upon request, thus facilitating easy placement into their reusable bags.” \nFor a retiree who wanted to be known only as Mrs Nathan, the shift towards eco-living started three years ago. \nCarrying a reusable bag at a FairPrice supermarket, the 65-year-old told TODAY that her children persuaded her to stop using plastic bags to “save the animals”. \nAs an avid news reader who has read about the effects of climate change, she added that the switch was easy for her. “If we don’t start (practising green habits), then our children and grandchildren won’t start. So we have to start somewhere.” \nMrs Nathan also said she rarely eats out, but when she does so with her family, she brings tiffin carriers in case there is unfinished food. \nAnother eco-conscious individual, social media executive Clara Quek, 25, said she would also bring her own bag, cup, and container when she goes out. \n“I started doing it during my internship two years ago as we always bought food back to the office to eat, and most of my colleagues brought containers.”\nMs Quek said that initially, washing and drying the containers after eating felt troublesome, but she soon adapted to it. \n“My motivation was to save on money paid for the plastic containers or cups, as I can save about S$1 on these disposables daily. If I ever forget to bring my container, I’ll choose to eat out instead,” she said. \nAlthough more shoppers in supermarkets appear to have swapped single-use plastic bags for their own reusable carriers, hawkers and other retailers told TODAY they have seen little change in consumer behaviour.\nOn a weekly basis, they encounter only a handful of customers who bring their own containers or bags, compared to hundreds who do not.\nMr Melvin Chew, 46, who runs Jin Ji Teochew Braised Duck hawker stall in Chinatown, said that consumers have come to accept that charges for plastic takeaway containers, as long as they are reasonable, are the norm. \n“When we started implementing takeaway charges of S$0.20 in the late 90s, there were many complaints. People thought hawkers should absorb the container cost.\n“But now, they’re probably used to it, unless you use something different like biodegradable packaging and charge S$0.50, maybe the complaints will come again,” he said.  \nAs with most hawkers, Mr Chew currently uses plastic containers for takeaways. He said he considered more eco-friendly alternatives such as biodegradable ones, but they cost twice as much. \nMr Chew explained that he does not profit from his charges for plastic containers.\nIn fact, he is making a slight loss as he is charging S$0.30 for large containers, even though they cost him about S$0.40 each. \nHe charges S$0.20 for small containers, which is his cost price. \nMs Doreen Winata, a franchisee of Shi Nian Pig Leg Rice in Kovan, said the rise in Goods and Services Tax (GST) to 9 per cent this year prompted her to start charging S$0.30 for takeaway containers. \nThe 27-year-old said that she initially absorbed this packing cost, but the GST hike made it difficult for her to sustain the business. After implementing the charge, she also switched to biodegradable containers to better justify the increase in price to her customers. \n“I actually hoped the S$0.30 charge would also make more people think about bringing containers, but I guess they are used to it because almost every stall charges for takeaway now.” \nOver at Hussain Muslim Food, also in Kovan, hawker Siti Leonita Minhad, 37, explained that it is tough for hawkers to cut down on the amount of plastic bags used because sometimes, they will need to pack different food separately to prevent spillage.\n“We also usually double-wrap hot food in plastic bags to ensure that it is safe until the customer reaches home.” \nCustomers who bring their own bags and cups to bubble tea stalls and bakeries are also few and far between, according to operators that TODAY spoke to. \nThose working at several bubble tea stalls, including Chi Cha San Chen, LiHo, and The Alley, said while they welcome customers who bring their own cups, they normally see such individuals less than five times a week. \nThe situation is also similar at food outlets such as Old Chang Kee, Dough Culture, and Jian Bo Shui Kueh, as well as bakeries nestled in public housing blocks. \nMs Chin Mei Lee, 60, a supervisor of an Old Chang Kee outlet in Bishan, said she has seen a slight uptick in customers who decline plastic bags when their food is being packed after the Government announced the minimum five-cent charge for plastic carriers in supermarkets last year, even though Old Chang Kee does not have such a charge.\n“Those who buy one or two snacks will tell us they don’t need a plastic bag, but there are only one or two such customers in a day,” she said.\nLikewise, Ms Widya Pujilestari, 43, who works at a bakery in Bishan, cited the same frequency of seeing only one to two customers a day declining plastic bags or asking for separate items to be packed together. \n“Generally, it would be difficult for bakeries like ours to reduce their use of plastics as we need to separate food with different taste profiles. We have sweet and savoury puffs, and we don’t pack them together unless the customer tells us it’s okay,” she added. \nEnvironmentalists say that given Singaporeans' busy lifestyle and preference for convenience, getting people to consciously adopt green habits remains a work in progress.  \n“Most people in Singapore, both consumers and businesses, are driven by dollars and cents — what is the cheapest and most convenient — and rarely by altruistic reasons,” said Ms Lin Qinghui, founder of D2L.sg, a one-stop food surplus and waste manager. \n“The culture here is to throw things away. It’s all about convenience, and it’s hard to change this because it’s ingrained in Singaporean society.” \nMr Rayson Lim, 27, who is unemployed, said he did try to pick up the habit of bringing his own container out for four to five months in 2022. Eventually, he stopped because he gave in to his laziness in washing the container after eating. \nCivil servant Shafiq Ahmad, 29, echoed Mr Lim’s sentiments. “I haven’t tried bringing my own container before, but just the thought of doing the washing after eating makes me feel it’s tiring and troublesome.” \nMs Tan Huileng, executive director of Zero Waste SG, said that the best way for consumers to change their habits, such as bringing their own containers, is to make it easy to include them in their daily routine. \n“Place them where they can be obviously seen so you can easily grab them and go,” she said.\n“Lastly, put some of these items in accessible areas in your journey, such as your car or office, so even if you forget to bring them from home, you still have access to your own container along the way.”  \nAmid the push to use less disposable plastic in everyday life, some companies have jumped on the bandwagon through moves such as charging for plastic bags and switching from conventional plastic bags or packaging to those using biodegradable plastic or paper and other non-plastic materials. \nHowever, there has also been debate on whether some of these practices constitute greenwashing. \nFor example, consumers have taken to online forums to discuss how one health and beauty retailer has started charging for plastic bags but still uses plenty of plastic for its house-brand water products. \nAnother discussion involved a food court chain that removed plastic straws but introduced cups with plastic caps for cold drinks, which sell for at least S$2. \nA consumer pointed out that cold drinks cost about S$1.40 a cup before the change. \nSome questioned whether the amount of plastic used for the cap is less than that of a straw, and whether this is just a gimmick to increase profit. \nOthers asked if paper or cloth alternatives for disposable plastics used by some retailers are actually more environmentally friendly.  \nMs Lin, the environmentalist, cautioned against advocating for non-plastic alternatives without considering Singapore’s “unique” waste management system.\nShe said that in Singapore, where all trash goes to the incinerator, plastics are efficiently incinerated, potentially reducing their harmful effects compared with countries relying on landfills.\nConversely, some other materials used to replace plastic come at a higher environmental cost as they might not burn as efficiently or as cleanly as plastic. \n“Plastic is not environmentally friendly, but if you look at the life cycle analysis across these materials, it’s the lesser evil because the alternatives, like woven cloth, fabric, cardboard, and paper, could actually bring more harm by leaving a larger carbon footprint,\" said Ms Lin.\nA life cycle assessment is a comprehensive method used to evaluate the environmental impacts of a product or service throughout its entire life cycle.\nIt considers various environmental factors, such as energy consumption, resource depletion, emissions to air, water, and soil, and waste generation at each stage of the product's life.\nSimilarly, Mr Yasser Amin, who heads Stridy, a non-profit organisation addressing urban waste management issues worldwide, said terms such as “biodegradable” or “compostable” often confuse the average person. \n“It's like a marketing tactic,” said Mr Yasser. He cited how some coffee and cafe chains switched from plastic to compostable straws, when these may not be the more environmentally friendly option.\n“Companies should be more aware and capable of conducting life cycle assessments to determine the true environmental impact of their alternatives. People need to question company claims more thoroughly.” \nOn NEA's website, in explaining why Singapore does not ban single-use plastics, the agency says that doing so may lead to a switch to disposables made from other materials such as paper or degradable plastics, “which also create waste, have their own set of environmental impacts and are not necessarily better for the environment”. \n“In view of the above, instead of advocating a switch to degradable materials, Singapore’s approach is to reduce the use of disposables regardless of material type, and promote the use of reusables.”\nA spokesperson for Starbucks, which is one of the cafe chains in Singapore using compostable straws, said in response to TODAY's queries that the company “strives to ensure sustainability and eco-friendliness across every touch point, taking proactive steps whenever feasible”.\n\"Our compostable straws are made from corn starch. In our efforts to eliminate plastic straws and reduce our environmental footprint, our cups and strawless lids are made of 100% recycled PET. This directly impacts the reduction in the usage of virgin PET in our ecosystem, reducing the overall carbon footprint,\" she said. \nPET stands for polyethylene terephthalate, a type of lightweight recyclable plastic commonly used to make beverage bottles and food packaging. \nThe spokesperson also listed various green initiatives by Starbucks Singapore, including a Borrow-A-Cup programme to encourage reuse, Bring Your Own Tumbler discounts, and a transition to eco-friendly materials for all packaging.\nA Skechers spokesperson said in response to TODAY's queries that it replaced plastic bags in 2019 with non-woven bags, which are resistant to tearing or fraying and are a more sustainable alternative to traditional woven fabrics.\nAs these bags can be used multiple times, they reduce the need for disposable plastic bags, “which, in turn, helps to reduce carbon footprint”, the spokesman added.\n“While we understand the concerns raised by environmentalists regarding alternative materials, we want to emphasise that… (we are) constantly evaluating and improving our processes to minimise our carbon footprint. \n“Our use of materials undergoes rigorous scrutiny to ensure we make meaningful strides towards a more sustainable future. We acknowledge the complexities involved and remain dedicated to transparent communication about our efforts,” she said. \nAt BreadTalk, customers who do not want to pay S$0.10 for a plastic bag have the option of buying a S$4 reusable bag made of polyester.\n“This material is known for its durability and water resistant qualities making it easy to wash if needed,” said the BreadTalk Group spokesman.\nThe BreadTalk Group, which also owns the cafe chain Toast Box, is also in the process of phasing out straws and switching to strawless lids at all Toast Box outlets, with a target to complete this transition by June.\nOther businesses that adopt and market their eco-friendly initiatives speak of similar challenges.\nMs Vanessa Kenchington, chief executive officer and founder of Plain Vanilla Bakery, said she and her team “openly admit” that they have had difficulties implementing plans to further their sustainability goals. \nThe bakery, which has several outlets across the island, ties boxes of cupcakes with twine to reduce the use of paper bags. Reusable paper bags are sold for S$0.50 each to those who need them. \nMs Kenchington said that while the company aims to be environmentally conscious and is committed to using more natural materials, balancing sustainability goals with the practicalities of running a viable business has been a constant challenge. \n\"When we looked into the possibility of composting our packaging independently, we realised there were not many packaging options that would meet the compostable requirement. It was hard to ensure the authenticity of suppliers claiming to offer compostable materials, which meant our packaging options would be very limited,” she said.\n“We accept that there are limitations to this for a business of our size when we try to be as sustainable as possible, and there is only so much we can do.” \nMs Germaine Lye, co-founder of sustainable fashion brand Our Barehands, said that it, too, is constantly balancing its priorities and has adopted a long-term approach to gradually work towards choosing sustainable practices as the business grows. \n“Currently, what guides our decision-making process is to choose the better alternative and one that does not undermine our objectives, to the best of our knowledge. \n“For example, we've chosen to use 100 per cent linen fabric over synthetic ones from day one. We’ve also requested transparency in the fabric production process. It's a learning process for everyone, including us,” she said. \nOur Barehands uses reusable cotton drawstring bags, which it provides free. \nIn response to TODAY’s queries on legislation or guidelines to tackle greenwashing, a spokesperson for the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) said that it is currently developing a guide to provide greater clarity to businesses on sustainability claims. \n“In recent years, CCCS has observed an increased interest from the public in environmental sustainability issues, and we have also noticed that more suppliers are making claims on the environmental impact of their products,” said the spokesperson. \n“Although CCCS has not received many complaints… CCCS sees the need to provide greater clarity to suppliers on the environmental claims that could amount to an unfair trade practice under the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act.”\nCCCS will share more details in due course, the spokesperson added.\nIn 2021, five government ministries released the Singapore Green Plan 2030, with ambitious targets to make Singapore more environmentally sustainable over the next decade. \nSome of these targets include reducing the amount of waste sent to the landfill by 20 per cent by 2026, and by 30 per cent by 2030. \nOne may question that the impact that Singapore, a small country with a population of over five million, can make in the grand scheme of things.\nBut experts such as Mr Tomas Louda, chief executive officer and co-founder of ETW, an international recycling company striving to eradicate single-use plastics, said that despite its small size, Singapore can make meaningful contributions to global environmental sustainability by leveraging its strengths in innovation and technology-driven solutions. \nHowever, Mr Louda said several challenges exist, such as limited public awareness about the consequences of plastic use and the difficulty of encouraging behavioural change.\nFurthermore, Singapore's infrastructure and waste management systems may not be fully prepared yet to handle the transition away from plastic.\nThis would then lead to logistical challenges in recycling and waste disposal.\n“Industries reliant on plastic packaging also struggle to find sustainable alternatives without compromising product safety and quality, while the absence of stringent regulations or incentives further impedes progress,” he said. \n“Addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach, including education and awareness campaigns to inform the public, investment in innovation for sustainable alternatives and recycling technologies, implementation of effective policies, and infrastructure development to support the transition towards a plastic-free future.” \nMr Jonathan Tostevin, chief executive officer of reusable takeaway container rental services Muuse, said that the authorities could improve infrastructure to boost public adoption of reusables. \n“On the policy side, we could test out what happens if we made reuse the default in defined areas like all tourist spots or Sentosa.\"\nMr Yasser of Stridy added that as the hawker culture is unique to Singapore and some other Southeast Asian countries, it would be challenging to look to different places like Europe and implement their policies here.\nSuch policies include a ban on the most common single-use plastic items, such as cutlery, stirrers and straws. \n“If we banned plastics in Singapore, we would have a riot. So whenever the Government introduces policies or laws, they have to take into consideration the whole of Singapore and how people would react,” he said. \n“And the hard truth is that only a small portion of Singaporeans care about sustainability.” \nHence, Mr Yasser said the authorities should also help make adopting reusables less burdensome on stakeholders and consumers. \n“For example, I believe the stallholders in food courts and hawker centres have to pay for washing fees. Why would they want to pay the monthly washing fees when buying styrofoam packets in the hundreds cost less? \n“So how can we look at doing away with washing fees or implementing new infrastructure changes, like building washing facilities in hawkers centres that don't have them?”  \nMr Yasser added that, ultimately, Singapore is a country built on convenience, and achieving sustainability will take time. \n“That’s why it’s very, very, very hard for us to shift. But it has to start with ourselves, as individuals, and how the difference we make will affect others because I know the ripple effect works,” he said. \n“I have been in the ripple effect. Someone organised that beach cleanup I first went to, and because of that, I'm here today. So I do my best. And if every one does their best, we're going to make a huge difference.” "

            "Article Body": "Adulthood is an invigorating stage of life as young people join the workforce, take on more responsibilities and set their sights on the future. But its many facets — from managing finances and buying a home to achieving work-life balance — can be overwhelming.\nIn this series, TODAY’s journalists help young Singaporeans navigate this stage of their lives and learn something themselves in the process.\nSINGAPORE — As the youngest in the family, I've always been quite comfortable living with my parents and having nothing to worry about in my material needs.\nHowever, as my parents have grown older, they have often spoken to me about having to take over ownership of the home at some point.\nThis responsibility would fall to me because my only other sibling, my older sister, is already married and living in her own home.\nSo, this would essentially mean that I'd need to decide whether to keep living at the family home or sell the place.\nAs someone used to relying on others to make the \"adult decisions\" for me, this has made me uncomfortable.\nFor instance, I'm not keen on the idea of having to engage property agents to assist with selling the family home, if that's the decision I make.\nAnd of course, if I did that, I would then need to buy a place of my own, likely a resale Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat.\nMy discomfort at the idea of dealing with property agents was exacerbated by horror stories I heard from my brother-in-law. He encountered one agent who tried to ask for more than the agreed commission after a sale.\nHe said: \"We had initially agreed to pay the agent a fee of 2 per cent for the sale of our home but he later asked for more commission when we managed to sell the property for a higher price.\" \nI asked if they had initially agreed on the fee and he said that they did but the agent later \"guilt-tripped\" him into thinking that more effort was put in to hunt for buyers. \nAlthough reluctant to give in to the agent, he eventually paid a 4 per cent commission for the condominium that was sold. \nThe conversation made me wary, but it was a doorway into a world I'd never thought much about, so I did some online research about agents and commissions.\nAfter all, I could find myself as both a seller and buyer of residential property some time down the track.\nI learnt that some agents typically take between 2 per cent and 4 per cent commission or, in some cases, a fixed rate of 1 per cent. Then, there are others who take a flat fee as their commission. A flat fee remains the same no matter what the price is for the property sale.\nAnother key point is that it's usually sellers who pay the commission to agents, though buyers do so on occasions, such as when buying resale HDB flats.\nSome fixed-rate agents have been using social media channels such as TikTok to promote themselves by questioning the need for homeowners to pay the typically higher commission rates.\nThese agents often tout the five-figure savings that their clients enjoy, even including testimonies with smiling photographs from some of them.\nIn turn, agents who go by commission-based fees have responded with their own social media posts claiming that flat-fee agents do not offer as complete a service as them.\nSeeking clarification, I decided to reach out to property experts and academics to find out more about what a young potential homeowner like me should look out for when engaging my first property agent.\nBuyers should expect to pay a 1 per cent commission if they are buying an HDB resale flat.\nHowever, buyers generally don't pay a commission purchasing private properties such as condominiums and landed properties, because the buyer's agent will usually \"co-broke\" with the seller's agent to share the commission received. \nProfessor Qian Wenlan, director of the Institute of the Real Estate and Urban Studies at the National University of Singapore (NUS), said that property agents who accept a flat fee are \"still a minority\".\nMost agents charge sellers the standard rate of 2 per cent of the purchase price of the property, she added.\nOne agency, Homeseller, which started out in 2019, charges a flat fee of S$1,999 to sellers of HDB resale flats and S$4,999 to sellers of condominiums.\nIt also charges a flat fee of S$1,999 to buyers of HDB resale flats.\nSo a buyer who appoints Homeseller to search for a HDB resale flat and buys it for S$790,000 will pay S$1,999 instead of S$7,900 that a commission-based agent charges.\nA seller of a S$790,000 HDB flat who also pays S$1,999 will save more, given that the commission for agents is 2 per cent or S$15,800.\nNew property agency Smartseller charges S$3,700 for sellers of HDB resale flats, S$7,700 for sellers of condominiums, and S$15,700 for sellers of landed properties.\nIn this case, if a seller were to appoint Smartseller to sell his S$1.35 million condominium, the co-brokered commission would be the flat fee of S$7,700 instead of between S$27,000 and S$54,000, which is the 2 per cent to 4 per cent that a commission-based agent charges.\nProf Qian said that the main distinguishing feature of flat-rate agents is that they tend to offer only partial services, whereas agents who charge the standard fee provide the full suite of services.\nReferring to flat-fee agents, she said: \"They are responsible for just the advertising, arranging viewing appointments and supporting with paperwork.\"\nAlthough they arrange the viewing appointments, they leave the seller to conduct the viewing.\nMr Dennis Lim, co-founder of property firm Homeseller who operates on a flat-fee basis, said that as an experienced property agent, he finds it \"boring\" to be around viewings because he does not add any value.\n\"I feel more accomplished when I focus on the prior consultation and the negotiation.\" \nMr Wilfred John Allais, marketing lead at Ohmyhome property agency, said that his firm charges 1 per cent commission for buyers and sellers of HDB resale flats.\nThe firm's agents will meet with buyers to discuss their housing preferences and understand their financial plans to ensure that they look at properties within their budget.\n\"Buyers can engage our agents to help find their dream HDB (resale) home at a fee of 1 per cent,\" he added.\n\"For condos, our agents will not charge the buyer but instead collaborate with the seller's agent through a co-broking arrangement.\" \nOn the other hand, agents such as Mr Geryl Lim from property firm OrangeTee take a percentage of the commission from sellers based on the transacted price for the sale or purchase.\nHe also said that first-time buyers would need to consider the customised scope of services that they are expecting from the agent before going ahead with a particular agent.\n\"As far as I am aware, most flat-fee agents do not turn up for appointments but leave the buyers to handle the viewings themselves, so these agents may not have any idea how the unit looks like or if there are any potential issues with the unit,\" Mr Geryl Lim said.  \nWithout an agent present, it can be difficult to show off the amenities of the property, which could make a huge difference in deciding if the unit is worth the price listed.\nProfessor Sing Tien Foo, provost's chair at the department of real estate at NUS Business School, said that it is important to find and engage property agents who are reliable and have good track records.\nHe said that this is especially important for young people and first-time homeowners like me.\n\"These agents will be able to provide objective and also unbiased advice based on the client's needs and financial considerations, and will be able to act in the best of the their interest rather than be merely motivated by their commissions or fees,\" he added.\nIn addition to checking reviews and making time for research to see what types of property the agent has sold, property experts also told me that it is key to ensure that the agent is registered with the Council for Estate Agencies, to avoid being cheated by a scam.\nPerhaps the advice that stuck with me the most came from Mr Luqman Hakim, chief data officer at property outfit 99.co, who said that the best thing for first-time homeowners is to find property agents not according to their fees but based on their level of experience in closing the sale of a property.\n\"Deeply discounted flat-fee agents or agencies are susceptible to lapses in giving proper service,\" he warned.\n\"The atypical low price advertised does not justify the returns of the typical amount of work and care provided by agents to market and close the property properly.\"\nAfter speaking with the experts and academics, I realised that preparing to engage a property agent for the first time requires a lot of thought.\nWhile I now have a better idea of what I am looking for in a property agent, the discussion has led me to realise that I may not be ready just yet to take over ownership of our family home.\nStill, I know it will happen eventually and I am hoping that when the time comes to make the difficult decision to sell my family home, I'll be well-equipped to engage the right property agent to assist me.

            "Article Body": "Adulthood is an invigorating stage of life as young people join the workforce, take on more responsibilities and set their sights on the future. But its many facets — from managing finances and buying a home to achieving work-life balance — can be overwhelming.\nIn this series, TODAY’s journalists help young Singaporeans navigate this stage of their lives and learn something themselves in the process.\nSINGAPORE — Recently, while I was in the middle of my seven months' long internship, I recall lying on my exercise mat fully dressed in my physical training attire, as though I was ready to commence my workout.\nBut unless my exercise routine consisted solely of the corpse pose, I did absolutely nothing that night.\nIt was close to midnight, and I had just knocked off from work, having pushed through multiple assignments that day. I realised that I only had enough willpower to change into my exercise kit but lacked the headspace to start the exercise.\n“Maybe tomorrow,” I thought to myself and resigned myself to the fact that it was going to be another day of physical inactivity.\nThis was becoming a common occurrence months after starting my first \"full-time job\" seven months ago, when I started my internship with TODAY as a journalist. These were my first steps as a newcomer in the workforce.\nIn the weeks before my internship began, I had resolved to start my journey towards healthier living. That meant incorporating daily exercises such as running and weight training, paired with close monitoring of my daily calorie intake.\nBut as soon as my first few work deadlines landed and in my daily haste to do a good job, any exercise routine I had went by the wayside. Once, I even found myself inadvertently skipping my meals.\nMy calorie-counting habits also gradually turned into subconscious snacking as I scavenged kitchen cupboards and raided pantries, eating whatever was conveniently available throughout the day.\nAlthough I was able to slowly acclimate to the workload, periods of increased stress caused my weight to fluctuate heavily from my all-time lowest of 78kg to around 84kg.\nDon't get me wrong, I know that these could be construed as excuses that can be overcome with enough determination and motivation.\nBut now that my internship is about to come to an end and I'll soon be entering the workforce upon graduation, I wanted to find out how I am able to cultivate the right mindset and deal with work stress concurrently. How can I manage my fitness goals while being a functional adult?\nTo find out, I spoke to several psychologists and dietitians who gave me some insights on why young adults going through a study-to-work transition may face additional stress, and how they can better manage their fitness and time during such adjustment periods. \nRight off the bat, Dr Annabelle Chow, a clinical psychologist in private practice at Annabelle Psychology in Singapore, helped me identify the common stressors for young adults going through adjustment periods.\nThis included increased responsibilities and meeting deadlines, as well as less common factors such as unclear workplace processes and organisational changes. \n“The shift in schedule and demands on our brains and bodies can disrupt sleep patterns, and make it challenging to maintain a healthy exercise routine or eat nutritious meals. The sedentary nature of many office jobs can also take a toll on physical health if we're not intentional about staying active,\n“The pressure to perform well and prove ourselves in a new environment can be quite overwhelming. Additionally, the learning curve and expectations may be higher, leading to increased feelings of stress and possibly imposter syndrome,” she said.\nRecalling my sleepless nights, anxiously worrying about any potential mistakes in my work, I found it hard to disagree with her assessment.\nMr Dion Lo Zhen Yu, a senior clinical psychologist and deputy head of therapy services at Better Life Psychological Medicine Clinic, added that young adults may feel a loss of autonomy and control during adjustment periods.\nDuring such phases, encountering obstacles may “evoke a sense of worthlessness, helplessness or even hopelessness”.\n“So (they) turn to something that’s accessible, that (they) think will give them a sense of power and control,” he said. \nWhile this may manifest in potentially healthy habits such as adopting a fitness regime for some, many turn to more convenient outlets which provide immediate gratification such as binge eating, which provides a false sense of control without tackling the underlying causes of stress.\nHaving gone through chapters of constant calorie consumption during stressful periods, I knew the highs and lows all too well.\nMs Shalyn Yamanaka, an accredited dietitian with the Singapore Nutrition and Dietetics Association, explained that eating comfort foods triggers the release of dopamine, a feel-good neurotransmitter that provides temporary relief from stress or unhappiness.\n“These behaviours can become habitual due to their ease, accessibility and the conditioning to associate them with immediate stress relief,” she said. \nAdopting an active and healthy lifestyle as a working adult not only brings about physical benefits but can also promote emotional well-being and improve cognitive function, said Dr Chow. \n“Exercise releases endorphins, which are natural mood boosters. These endorphins help reduce stress, increase feelings of happiness and well-being, and improve sleep quality, resulting in a more relaxed and rejuvenated state of mind,\n“Cognitively, exercise enhances blood flow to the brain, promoting brain function and improving focus, making it easier to cope with stressors. Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight, combined with regular exercise, can foster a sense of accomplishment,” she added. \nAs I slogged through my adjustment period and gradually increased my efficiency at work, I began adopting a more structured fitness routine, but still found myself dissatisfied with my seemingly slow rate of progression. \nI simply wasn’t seeing the fast results in weight loss and fitness improvement I desperately craved.\nTo this, Mr Lo explained that those just starting their fitness journeys may jump the gun and overcompensate, setting unrealistic goals for themselves, potentially from a guilt or fear-driven mindset that is often unsustainable. \nInstead, Mr Lo recommended a “staircase” approach to goal setting, taking incremental steps and setting realistic milestones while recognising “micro-successes” along the way.\nDr Chow raised similar points, suggesting breaking down goals into manageable, five to ten-minute routines that can easily fit into daily schedules. \n“Celebrate taking a step forward, even if it seems small. A step forward is in itself worthy of celebration, compared to never taking a step at all,\n“We tend to overestimate our goals and underestimate our achievements. Do the opposite. Craft specific, clear, measurable steps and checkpoints that we celebrate each time we hit them. From time to time, re-evaluate your goals and how important they are to you,” she said.\nMs Yamanaka added that our health and fitness goals should evolve, but be rooted in intrinsically enjoyable activities.\n“Figure out what makes you happy and content. Find a running or cycling group, tennis partner, or yoga class that you enjoy. Find a friend that will go with you, so it is a social activity and you have someone who keeps you accountable.\n“When you are doing something for the love of it, and really enjoy it, the habit is more sustainable and is no longer a chore to do,” she said.\nAs for cultivating healthy eating habits, experts shared that moderation and diversification of stress outlets were key factors in managing our consumption habits. \n“There is no harm in eating the food we like or buying a gift for ourselves once in a while. However, if it becomes our default way of coping with stress, that is when we need to supplement our stress management toolbox,” said Dr Chow.\n“If you enjoy a piece of cake as an afternoon snack, sit and savour that cake and check in with how you are feeling at dinner to see if you need to eat a full meal or not,” added Ms Yamanaka.\nMost importantly, my main takeaway after speaking to the experts was to have realistic expectations for ourselves during our fitness journeys. \nSomehow, it had not occurred to me that setting a half marathon distance of 21.1km as my next milestone, after only managing 14km on my longest run thus far, was clearly unrealistic. \nTreating each run as a wasted effort just because I had not surpassed my previous pace or distance certainly did not help.\nAs I will soon be starting another job during the holidays before returning to school for my final term, I plan to incorporate a sustainable fitness routine with attainable goals into my weekly schedule.\nBut before that, armed with all these adulting tips, I’ll need to rediscover my passion for fitness. \nMaybe it’s time to lace up my shoes and go for my first relaxing run in a while.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nTan Ming Chuan is an intern journalist and producer at TODAY."

But its many facets — from managing finances and buying a home to achieving work-life balance — can be overwhelming.\nIn this series, TODAY’s journalists help young Singaporeans navigate this stage of their lives and learn something themselves in the process.\nSINGAPORE — As a bright-eyed fresh graduate, I was thrilled to land my first full-time job last year and was raring to tear off the “unemployed” tag that comes in the period after completing one's studies.\nFinally, I would be financially independent, or so I thought, but things do not always turn out the way you hope.\nAfter just three months, I was laid off from my role as part of a wider retrenchment exercise and was once again unemployed. Most of the staff in my small team lost their jobs.\nTo add salt to the wound, the letter bearing the grim news was handed to me exactly a week after I had received my employment confirmation letter.\nNaturally, I was bummed about the turn of events, but I resolved to secure a new gig as soon as possible.\nAnd so, I jumped back into the job search cycle again — sending out resumes and going for job interviews until I  landed a job at TODAY early this year.\nBut even as I settled into my new role, I could not shake the anxiety that I might lose my \"rice bowl\" once again.\nThere were moments that caused my thoughts to spiral toward the worst possible outcome of getting let go by the company and led me to recall my experience with retrenchment.\nFor instance, a message from my editor simply to ask how I was coping and to have a chat about my goal-setting gave me a mini panic attack — my palms turned clammy and I began to ruminate on how I had been performing.\nWould this lead to a chat about getting let go instead?\nInitially, I attributed my nerves to new job jitters — who doesn't feel slightly on edge when thrust into a new environment?\nBut when such feelings persisted past my first month at work, I confided in some friends about my fears and learnt that I was not alone in experiencing such feelings.\nIn fact, a recent survey by TODAY found that 74 per cent of youths think that they could be retrenched at least once in their lifetime.\nThe experience of losing my job so abruptly made me question if I had what it took to tackle the tasks that were handed to me.\nEven though I had been retrenched for some time, I did not like talking about it as I had associated it with having not performed up to standard.\nIn fact, the thought that haunted me the most each time I recalled my retrenchment was that it seemed a lot like a line from a bad break-up: Was I not good enough?\nWhen I spoke to Dr Geraldine Tan, the principal psychologist at The Therapy Room, about my experience, she said that those who have been laid off should understand that getting retrenched is not a personal thing.\n“Because your self-esteem has taken a beating from this rejection, many of us will experience doubt and question our abilities to perform up to task.” \nDr Tan added that the lack of transparency on the part of companies about the retrenchment criteria also fuels the self-doubt that those who have been laid off face, causing many to question why they were “chosen” to be let go over others.\nThe timing of my retrenchment — just a week after my confirmation — and the shock of it compounded my self-doubt and caused my anxiety to persist long after I had settled into a new job.\nCareer coach Adrian Choo, chief executive of consulting firm Career Agility International, said that retrenchments are commonplace today with no negative associations.\n“Whether you’re a fresh graduate or in middle management, a lot of individuals have this issue of feeling anxious about their work performance today.” \nHe added that hiring managers are also more understanding of the job market situation now.\nRetrenched workers need a change in mindset over being laid off, Dr Tan said.\nThey should see the event not as reflecting a personal flaw but rather a corporate decision to sustain the company.\nAs I got used to the fast pace of the newsroom, I temporarily forgot my anxieties as the day-to-day work would take up most of my attention.\nEven so, there were times when I would make a mistake and start to question my ability to do my job well.\nTo allay such anxieties, Mr Choo suggested that workers check in regularly with their supervisors to understand how they were performing and where they could improve.\n\"This can reduce work-related anxiety and allow open communication between bosses and workers,\" he said. \nAnd while many would have heard this advice before, Mr Choo reiterated that learning new skills is the top way to ensure one’s relevance in the job market, regardless if you’re new to the job or a seasoned professional.\nAnd whether or not you’re facing an impending retrenchment, Mr Choo stressed the importance of networking to grow your circle of contacts.\nYou can turn to these contacts to seek out other job opportunities in the unfortunate case of a layoff, he said.\nLuckily for me, I kept in contact with my previous internship employer, who kindly provided me with freelance writing gigs while I continued to search for a full-time position.\nMy current role also allows me to interact with people of different backgrounds, giving me many opportunities to meet and network with others outside of the industry.\nIn the months after I was laid off, I also took up a copy writing course on the open online course provider platform Coursera.\nMy previous role, while it also involving writing, was rather content-heavy and seldom touched on more technical aspects such as content marketing. \nI won’t deny it — the learning curve in the course was steep at first as I was unfamiliar with the technical jargon.\nHowever, I figured that knowing how to market my work would help greatly to distinguish myself from the pool of talent in the job market.\nOn the emotional wellness side of things, Dr Tan suggested simple exercises such as going on a brisk walk to get some sun and clear your head or shaking your hands out to release any pent-up tension when you get too overwhelmed.\nShe said having a support network will also make things easier to manage as it can help you to discuss any lingering anxieties and ease you into your new role.\nWhile trying to get used to my new role, I confided in my family and friends about some of my fears.\nThey offered insights and advice based on their own experience, helping me to rationalise my anxieties as well as think about my long-term career goals.\nBut most importantly, workers should concentrate on what they are good at and reinforce it so that they will be able to showcase their skills, Dr Tan and Mr Choo both said.\n“Remind yourself of what you are good at, rather than what you are not good at, so that you can help yourself to better manage your anxieties and doubts,” Dr Tan said.\nAs part of the goals I set for myself this year, learning how to create and edit videos was one of the top items on my agenda. \nThis month, I will get the opportunity to try out a month-long attachment as a producer with the Audience Growth team at TODAY, where I will be learning how to edit videos and try my hand at story boarding, among other things.\nDespite knowing full well that I am a complete noob at anything related to creating videos, I am more excited than ever to take on this new role. \nPicking up new skills may not be the easiest, but these fresh skills will help in my job search should I eventually move on to my next gig.\nWho knows, I might create a video that's good enough for an award nomination some time.\nI suppose the process of losing a job is a lot like breaking up with a partner you've become attached to.\nIn both scenarios we feel a sense of loss, then indignation and finally learning to come to terms with it — almost like a grieving process where healing comes only after you acknowledge the pain. \nFor now, I'll start off by checking in with my editor to find out how I'm performing at work.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nShynn Ong is a journalist at TODAY covering general news."

I remember going through a series of emotions, and the one that stuck with me was the feeling of regret. \nA week after his cremation, I quit my job and fell into this routine of having full-on meltdowns every day. I lost interest in doing things that I used to love and avoided going to places which reminded me of my dog.\nI am the youngest of my family, with one older sister, and after joining the family, my dog had been my closest companion.\nDuring my secondary school days, he accompanied me while I studied and waited for the rest of the family to come home from work. When I was sad, he'd be the one sitting next to me, offering comfort. \nFor all these reasons and more, his death was especially hard for me to process because I felt like I failed him by not being there for him when he took his last breath. I regretted having spent all my time doing other things when I could have used that time wisely with my dog.\nIt did not help that the sudden jarring emptiness at home only made it more evident that he was no longer around.\nAs my family watched me struggle with my grief, I was grateful to have them rally around to support me in whatever way they could.\nFrom offering a listening ear to talking with me about the happy memories of my dog, they did their best to listen and understand to help me cope with the overwhelming emotions.\nLooking back on 2021, I am surprised that the death of my pet had affected me as much as it did.\nDespite the understanding from my family, I still feel slightly embarrassed whenever a relative makes a comment about how dramatic I had been over the death of \"just a pet\".\nWondering whether this was abnormal, I spoke to grief experts to find out how the emotional impact of losing a pet compares with losing a human, and if my grief will ever go away.\n\"The grief for a pet would not be less and for some people it would mean even more grief as the love and care invested is more than that of a human,\" said Dr Geraldine Tan, director and principal psychologist of the Therapy Room.\nShe added: \"A pet's love is unconditional and therefore irreplaceable.\"\nDr Sylvia Tan, founder and principal counselling psychologist at Sylvia Tan Psychology Consultancy echoed this sentiment.\nShe said some studies have found that grief over a pet can last longer than grief for a human, and those who grieve over a pet's death are three times more likely to develop symptoms of depression than the average person.\nShe also pointed out that in cases like mine, where the pet is seen as a source of comfort and companionship, the death would be much more significant and impactful because of the deep connection shared.\nThe experts said one misguided belief about grief they often hear is how it has a fixed timeline or an \"expiration date\".\nThey said that it is common to think this way because of a general misconception that if someone is still feeling sad after some time has passed since the death, the person is somehow not moving on.\nTo this, Ms Alexandra Bohnen, senior counsellor at Sofia Wellness Clinic said: \"Grief is not linear, and while the intensity usually lessens over time, it behaves more like waves that hit us.\"\nI felt a sense of relief hearing that what I had been through was a normal reaction to the loss of an important companion in my life.\nIt feels rather validating as well, knowing that even if I cry when I miss my dog, it does not mean I'm being overtly sensitive.\nWhen I asked if this grief I feel will ever go away, Ms Bohnen advised that it will get easier as the waves of emotion become less frequent and less intense as life moves on but I would learn to live and grow without my dog with me.\nI take that advice with me now whenever I feel those tears well up.\nIt's been more than 18 months now and while my emotions have settled for the most part, I still have days when I burst out crying from seeing an owner interact with their dog or come across a TikTok video talking about topics such as \"Five ways to know your dog loves you\".\nIn a way, my grief has taught me a lot about myself and while I know that I will always miss him dearly, it will eventually get easier with time.\nABOUT THE WRITER:\nJasmine Ong, 32, is a journalist at TODAY."

But its many facets — from managing finances and buying a home to achieving work-life balance — can be overwhelming.\nIn this series, TODAY’s journalists help young Singaporeans navigate this stage of their lives and learn something themselves in the process.\nSINGAPORE — In the last two years, five people I knew died from sudden cardiac arrest. They were young and seemingly healthy people whose untimely demise came as a shock to their family and friends.\nThey ranged in age from about 25 to 35.\nThe grief hit me pretty hard, as I felt a lot of guilt and regret about my relationship with some of them. It got me to thinking — are more young people dying from sudden cardiac arrest? And should I be worried?\nCardiologists from the National University Heart Centre Singapore told me that the risk of sudden deaths in young people remains exceedingly low.\nBased on the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) data report published by the Singapore Heart Foundation four years ago, those above the age of 65 constitute the highest risk group of patients, accounting for 36.2 per cent of the 3,000 cases of cardiac arrest in 2019. There are about 3,000 cases of OHCA yearly here.\nOne cardiologist told me that the prevalence of OHCA in Indians and Malays is twice the rate of Chinese. The prevalence of OHCA in men is also twice that of women. \nWhile uncommon, there are underlying conditions among young adults that can lead to sudden deaths, such as hypertrophic cardiomypathy (abnormal thickening of heart muscles) or arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythm of genetic causes), another cardiologist said. \nThis is why health screenings are important, as people often believe themselves to be healthy if they do not have any symptoms of underlying disease when they may have conditions that are asymptomatic.\nThough sudden cardiac arrest among young people with no underlying conditions is rare, I could not shake this feeling that my life could be taken from me at any time.\nThis led me to move beyond concerns over cardiac arrest affecting the young to wonder more broadly at the meaning of my brief, mortal existence. I was left feeling unmotivated and uneasy. \nDon’t get me wrong, my life is going okay — I have a good job, I have a roof over my head, I have two beautiful kids and a supportive husband — but I was being consumed by this thought that if life is so short, why bother doing anything?\nIt occurred to me that I was perhaps having an existential crisis.\nDr Praveen Nair, a psychologist and senior consultant at Raven Counselling and Consultancy, said that this occurs when there is an inner conflict within an individual causing them to break from traditional thinking patterns and recalibrate to become more contemplative with regard to questions about meaning, purpose and identity in life. \nDr Nair also reassured me that I am not the only one feeling this way, as he has seen more adult clients with similar issues. \nOne contributor to this is social media, said Dr Nair, as some netizens cherry pick what they share online to present a rosy picture of their lives, which can cause other users viewing the content to experience \"fomo\" (fear of missing out).\nThis, in turn, can lead them to wondering about their direction in life. \nDr Nair said it is normal to experience an existential crisis even when things in your life seem to be going okay as many things, both overt and subliminal, can influence our thoughts even when our lives are relatively routine.\nIn fact, some argue that the mundane and routine can be a stimulus to initiating thoughts about the larger meaning or purpose of life. \nThis makes sense, as I have been feeling a certain kind of tedium for some time now, juggling work and caring for two young children daily. \nMs Abigail Yang, a grief therapist at counselling platform Talk Your Heart Out, said that it is normal to think deeply about life or question how you feel about it.\nThe more fundamental issue is when no answer satisfies you, she added. \n“It becomes a constant loop of complex questions with no fulfilling solution. This, in turn, leads to a conflict within yourself about your reason for existence,” said Ms Yang.\nIn some cases, extreme thoughts and unanswerable questions can leave one feeling frustrated, anxious, depressed and even suicidal, said experts. \nThey also shared that one way to overcome an existential crisis is to disengage from pursuits or people that bring me no joy and redirect my energy to those that do. Dr Nair said this can help initiate renewed drive and motivation in life. \n“It may sound counterintuitive but many great innovations occurred when inventors experienced an existential crisis. They channelled their energies into a new venture that was motivating,” he told me. \nOne way to overcome the crisis is to also take time to connect more with people whose company I enjoy, as an existential crisis can occur when we feel disconnected from others, said Dr Nair. \nMs Yang reminded me that it is okay to allow myself to feel such negative emotions, and that I should not suppress them. \nSome people block out pain and suffering, thinking this will make them happy, but it can often lead to a false sense of happiness, she said.\nEmbodying emotions and acknowledging feelings of pain, discontentment and dissatisfaction can open the door to personal growth, and improve one’s outlook on life, Ms Yang added.\nOne tip I got from a friend that has helped me deal with my existential crisis is this: \"KonMari\" your schedule, rid yourself of self-imposed duties and obligations and identify areas where you could be doing less, doing something easier, or doing nothing at all.\nThis is a reference to Japanese author Marie Kondo and her ideas about ridding our lives of needless clutter.\nThis might mean, for instance, your one-hour exercise routine becomes a 20-minute one, or perhaps you ditch it all together for an extra hour of sleep. \nThe only person that should be happy with the choice you make is you. \nABOUT THE WRITER:\nNabilah Awang, 29, is a former Senior Journalist at TODAY."

But its many facets — from managing finances and buying a home to achieving work-life balance — can be overwhelming.\nIn this series, TODAY’s journalists help young Singaporeans navigate this stage of their lives and learn something themselves in the process.\nSINGAPORE – As a Singapore Polytechnic student, I knew it would only be a matter of time till I had to do an internship, since it was part of the criteria for finishing my course in creative writing. But the inevitability of it didn’t make the idea any less scary to me. \nPrior to interning, the only jobs I ever worked were part-time jobs that lasted only for the duration of my holidays, a vastly different experience from a six-month-long internship in a newsroom.\nHaving to hold down a graded \"grown up\" job for six months absolutely terrified me. It felt like 22 weeks worth of opportunities to mess up.\nAnd after two rough semesters academically, I was terrified of fumbling it all up.\nSo when I finally landed an internship in the TODAY newsroom, the pressure to not mess up was immense, especially because getting fired from the internship guaranteed an instant fail for an entire semester’s worth of credits.\nYet as I wrap up the final weeks of my internship, I’m walking away with a positive outlook on my time here, having learned so many things about myself and about the professional working world. \nWeeks before my internship even started, I was already dreading the thought of it. I felt such immense anxiety about messing up at work that I wanted to avoid it all together. \nBut no matter what, the need to graduate trumped all my anxieties. Pushing my worries to the back of my mind, I pulled myself together and showed up for my first day.\nOn my first week of work, I felt like I was thrown into the deep end.\nAfter being sent to a press conference (with another reporter to shadow) on my second day and having to contact owners of big businesses on my third day of work, I quickly learned that the actual job is very different from what I learned in school.\nI relied heavily on guidance and advice from other reporters I shadowed, which was apparently the right thing to do, said Mr Ben So, founder and career coach of Emunah Coaching and Training.\nHe said that when starting a new job, it is important to know the company's structure and culture.\n“Be humble to ask your colleagues or supervisor how things are done in this company and do your best to follow,” Mr So said.\nBut as time passed, I feared the “window of time” where it's acceptable to make mistakes was closing, and I was still messing up too often.\nI had this expectation of how I should have been performing that created an extra layer of stress at work. But that shouldn't have been the case.\nMr So said that although an internship is an opportunity for employers to see if a candidate is a good fit for a full-time position, it is also a chance for the intern to experience this new environment.\n“The intern should observe the work culture and ask themselves if they truly enjoy the job scope and working with the team,” he said.\nI was focusing too much on the wrong thing, which was my own expectations, rather than the actual experience I was having. \nAnd I had to learn that messing up is an inevitability when you’re new to anything.\nMr Ng Jun Sen, one of the editors who supervise interns at TODAY, said that although it's good to have interns who are able to handle their workload well, “the ones who leave a lasting impression are those who start out with uncertainties and make mistakes… but always kept their chin up, put in the hard work and improved over the course of their internship”.\n“I expect interns to challenge themselves and strive to discover their potential. Excelling is optional, but seeing interns put in effort means everything,” he added.\nThis expectation of my work that I’d set for myself set me on the path of burning out, which hit me halfway through my stint.\nPerhaps it was also because I was not used to working for such a long period or that I was simply running out of steam. I woke up feeling tired every day regardless of how much rest I got and I felt disillusioned with what I was doing.\nWhen it comes to struggling at work, Mr So advised that interns speak to their supervisors, mentor or senior colleagues for assistance, or if they feel uncomfortable talking to someone at work about it, a career coach could also help.\nThe advice was echoed by Mr Ng who added that when facing issues, the first thing anyone should do is to understand where the issue lies, look at how others at work deal with the problem and strategise from there.\n“The best part of being an intern is that you're young, you're given many chances by default, and trying and failing is part of your growth,” he said.\nWhile I slowly got a grip of what I was doing at work, I was faced with another issue that I was unprepared for, having to do the adult thing and having a “work-life balance”.\nMr So suggested that interns or people new to working life meet up with their peers to update one another of their work adventures, spend their weekends with family, and do sports to help maintain work-life balance.\nI struggled to do any of these.\nI was unable to see my friends as often as I did when we were in school. Since most of my friends were interning as well, it was hard to find time to see each other together, even if it was just for a quick meal. \nPlanning gatherings felt like solving an equation with so many factors to account for and different schedules to accommodate.\nNot only that, I had to learn to make time for myself to just unwind and relax, be it after work or on weekends, because I found myself obsessively thinking about work even in my free time.\nTime felt like it was flying by, with all my days mushing together into one. I had only a few hours to myself after work and I wasn’t used to having so little time to myself.\nSo in an attempt to not become one of those folks whose life revolved around their jobs, I began exploring more activities to do in my own time.\nI began creating a \"schedule\" for my free time, allocating time every evening for playing my guitar, gaming or just chatting with my friends over Discord. I made sure to carve out time to relax and socialise with friends. \nOn weekends, I allocated one day to do activities and hang out with friends, and one day to shut off my brain and be lazy at home. I even picked up bouldering as a new hobby to do with friends every week or so.\nThough interning has been a rollercoaster, it has taught me so much about the job that I’ve wanted to do since I was 15, given me a taste of adult working life and allowed me to learn more about how to handle my personal wellbeing. \nAnd who knows, maybe someday after I finish my studies, I might want to join the industry full time.\n \nABOUT THE WRITER:\nLou Si Yuan, 19, is an intern journalist at TODAY."

            "Article Body": "The tears that flowed once I crossed the finish line at the 19th Asian Games on Oct 2, 2023, pretty much said it all. \nIt was the cherry on top of a magical 2023 season: I broke national records and personal bests, I championed the continent on a few occasions, heard Majulah Singapura play from atop those podiums and, sweetest of all, qualified for the 2024 Paris Olympics. \nFor context, this does not come by very often. Athletes generally don’t see this many successes and continued breakthroughs in such a short period of time. But that’s just how it is in a sport: It’s normal not to see progress for a while.      \nWith that, I have so many people to thank for a truly magical year: My coach, family, sport science team, and the list goes on. \n     \nI have myself to thank, too. I owe my success to my younger self, who had to go through years of doubt, desolation, and unlucky circumstances in order to get here. But all those experiences only made her stronger than ever before. \nA lot of people know me as Singapore’s Sprint Queen — a title I first got in 2013 when I became the first woman to run the 100m event in under 12 seconds and the 200m in 24 seconds. \nThis label gained even more traction after I clinched Singapore’s first sprint gold at the 2015 Southeast Asian (SEA) Games. Before that, we hadn’t won one in 42 years. \nThis was a pivotal time in my track and field journey. I was launched into both the athletic scene as well as the public eye, and from this point on, I got a taste of what being in high-performance sports is like. \nI stepped onto a new track, one that came with amazing opportunities, incredible exposure, and a pathway to pursue this sport long-term. \nBut it also came with a lot of expectations and a lot of pressure, both external and internal, which I was neither prepared for nor had the experience to fully understand and accept. \nPerhaps it was arrogance; perhaps it was just a lack of dealing with the immense pressures following a remarkable feat. \nRegardless of what it was, when I could not uphold the same title of SEA Games Gold Medallist in 2017, I felt like a complete failure. I thought I no longer had what it took to be Singapore’s Sprint Queen. \nAt the same time, I was coming off a less than ideal coach-athlete relationship and other life struggles, including the loss of two academic scholarships within a week of each other. I had to figure out how I was going to settle my tuition fees, along with extra cash for spending and saving. \nAll these setbacks made for some rough years as a young adult. I found myself at such a loss of what to do and who I was.\n     \nI succumbed to what others thought of my abilities, giving them the power to dictate what I should do with my life. I questioned everything about myself, to the point where I became so afraid of even approaching the start line. \nMy mind was stuck in a cloud of fear and uncertainty: Once I crossed the finish line, would another wave of disappointment kick in? Would people say I was weak, that I was not good enough?\nRight before the 31st SEA Games in May 2022, something clicked. \n“Who cares?” I realised. “Who cares what people think? Why am I allowing them to define who I am? I started track 18 years ago because I loved it — why should I let people who matter the least to me determine my next steps?” \n     \nSuddenly, my mind was clear. I knew exactly what I had to do, and how to do it. \nI started to look at my failures and mistakes less as weaknesses, but more as strengths — points of my life that I could learn from to become more of a master in my speciality, and to become a better version of myself. \nWhy bother wallowing in self-pity when there’s absolutely nothing I can do about it anymore? I can’t change the past, so why not think instead about how to do better in the future? \nI’ve never thought that resilience is something people are born with — but I did think of it as something everyone organically builds simply by experiencing setbacks, failures and mistakes. \nWhat I’ve learned is that resilience is a result of actually learning from these setbacks and failures and choosing to alter your path ahead of you for the better. \nI was no longer afraid, and I found my love for the sport again. \nFast forward to January 2024: I successfully defended my 200m SEA Games title two years in a row (2022 and 2023) and earned the gold in the 100m in 2023 as well. \nI ran the 200m in under 23 seconds for the first time, became Singapore's first Asian Champion in both events, made it to the semifinals of the World Championships, qualified for the Olympics and earned the 200m Gold and 100m Silver at the 19th Asian Games — all while setting personal bests, national and championship records in the process. \nThe best part is that I am nowhere near done.      \nI’m now training towards the next big thing: The 2024 Paris Olympics in July. I’m having the time of my life — all because I decided to live my life for myself, not for others. \nHigh expectations and tough pressures are part and parcel of being an athlete, so I now cope with it by accepting it for what it is — something that naturally occurs when achieving something great in the public eye that is simply beyond my control. \nSo, I’ve stopped trying to control the expectations, pressures, and the comments from strangers on the Internet.\nInstead, I focus on the things that I can control: My training and competition plans, my personal routines, staying disciplined and consistent in my habits, and my attitude and adaptability. \nIn professional sports, hard work is not enough.\nBeing an athlete is not confined to time spent on the track. It’s a 24/7 job, placing my sport as a priority above everything else and continually working on recovery, which is just as important as showing up to the track, if not more so.\nIt requires big lifestyle changes, and an intentional change in perspective of what I do.\nGearing up for Paris 2024, my plans for the year are made up of large sacrifices.\nI have to spend the majority of my time overseas, away from friends and family, missing events and milestones along the way. I have to stay disciplined with my time and routines on a daily basis — no late nights, no casual drinking, and eating right, all of which can be hard to maintain for months on end. \nBecause of these demands, my circle of friends has naturally grown smaller — but I’m not upset about it, because the people who have remained truly understand my lifestyle and have shown that they will support me no matter what.\nThe inaugural Singapore Resilience Study, released in September 2023 by Income Insurance Limited and Centre for Research on Successful Ageing at the Singapore Management University, categorises resilience into four domains — physical, mental, financial and social. \nPersonally, I see that all four types are important for each of us to be empowered to overcome the challenges we face in life. \nUltimately, I do not regret those seven years of hardship because they have made me into the person I am today, and I’m proud of that. \nTo anyone out there who may be struggling to find your footing again — don’t be afraid to accept your mistakes, learn from them and come back stronger.\nOne of the lessons my past struggles have taught me is to be more prudent in my spending and save as much as I can for the future. It’s true that sports careers don’t last as long as others do, but all I can do is to, again, focus on the things I can control. \nI’m thankful that I’ve gotten to a point in my career where I can see a steady pay cheque, racing bonuses and additional media engagements. I have paid back my student loans entirely, and saved up enough to begin making investments that will help me build the future I want, whatever obstacles and hardships I may face.  \nI take these lessons with me throughout every single point of my life.\nIn my sport and my life now — and in the future, when I eventually retire — my strategies will remain the same. I will focus on the things within my control, embrace every single opportunity that I get, appreciate the people around me and enjoy the process, no matter what it might be.\nRegardless of who’s watching on the sidelines of my life, it’s me on the track, putting one foot in front of the other. Only I have the power to determine what happens in my journey.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nShanti Pereira, 27, is Singapore's “Sprint Queen” with multiple national records and medals at the SEA Games.

            "Article Body": "Can you remember the last time you disagreed with somebody? \nHow did you tell them about it? What were you more concerned about — whether you were communicating your point effectively, or whether you were in danger of offending them or hurting their feelings? \nDid you tell them to their face? Or did you wait till you parted ways to drop them a text? \nDid you even tell them at all? Or did you confide your dissent only to trusted friends, knowing they would keep your secret?\nOn a recent trip with friends, we spent a week giggling our way through South Korea. \nWe drove on the wrong lane in Jeju, tried raw marinated crab for the first time in Yeosu, and gorged ourselves on street food in Seoul. \nWe slept on futons in a traditional Korean hotel and joked about being in our Jewel in the Palace era. We ziplined off the 24th floor of a Ramada hotel and made fun of ourselves for it on social media: “Your unemployed friends on a Tuesday afternoon”.\nWanting to spend more time together, we shelled out for an AirBnB large enough to accommodate us all. We got to know each other better over long conversations about our families and friends, our past lovers and partners, and our jobs (for real though, do you know what your friends actually do for work?).\nWe were having a good time. \nFor dinner on our last night, someone suggested Korean BBQ (or, as it’s known there, BBQ). \nIt’s a truth universally acknowledged that last-night dinners on overseas trips are special. People are worn in by then, happy but exhausted. Guards are let down; everything seems to draw out longer and lazier as we try to make the most of these last hours. \nThe part of the dinner where we were actually eating food transitioned into the part where we picked at the remaining “courtesy” morsels, just to have an excuse to keep talking. \nA sensitive topic came up in conversation. Nothing new — we’re generally pretty comfortable with discussing all sorts of things with each other, and had been doing so throughout the entire trip.\nOne of the group voiced an opinion they described as “preference”. I felt it was prejudice — and I told them so, right then and there. \nA debate sparked right away — not heated, exactly, but it ramped up the longer it went on. The whole group got involved. Everybody wanted to share their take on it; everybody wanted to know what was behind each other’s take. \nSoon enough, other sensitive topics were drawn into the fray. Not being one to mince words, I once again expressed a contrary sentiment — and that’s when something snapped.\nPeople lost control of their emotions. We talked over each other. Spoke in accusatory tones. Got personal.\nIt went on as we paid the bill and left the restaurant. \nIt went on in the cab ride home.\nIt went on once we were back in our AirBnB.\nAll considered, it went on for nearly five hours, give or take. (There was definitely a moment or two where I lowkey regretted our halcyon decision to get that AirBnB together.)\nWhat were we talking about? Frankly, it doesn’t matter. It could have been anything, really. \nWhat I did find myself thinking about long after that conversation had ended was the nature of disagreement.\nIt’s no surprise that a lot of people aren’t comfortable with disagreement — the very concept does inherently require some measure of tension or friction, after all. \nThat discomfort is compounded several times over when it’s in relation to a sensitive topic, and understandably so. \nThis is why politics and sexuality are big no-no’s for first-date conversations. Singaporeans, in particular, are notoriously apprehensive when it comes to talking about race and race-related issues. \nThe key concerns are always the same: It’s too easy to offend; people are too easily offended.\nBut what does it really mean to offend, or to be offended? Surely there can be no harm in expressing a personal thought or sentiment as long as it’s supported with genuine, positive intent? \nWhat if what we’re really afraid of is disagreement itself? \nHumans are communal animals. No one likes feeling alone, or like we’re being forcibly divided or separated from others. This is the entire basis and appeal of social media: Connect with people whenever you want from wherever you are! Find others who like the same things you like, so you never have to like them alone! \nBut all that communality cannot change the fact that we are individualised persons, each with our own thoughts and feelings. \nIt’s what makes human connection so powerful and beautiful. \nIt’s also the reason why we will never be able to create an environment, physical or virtual, that is completely free of disagreement.\nTo be fair, disagreement can be scary sometimes — but that doesn’t mean we have to be afraid of it. \nPicture two people living together in one house.\nDisagreement doesn’t automatically mean one of them moving out into a different house. It can simply be the occupants working together to create a new room within the house — carving out space for more of their individual selves to fit under the same roof. \nIn that sense, disagreement doesn’t have to mean opposition or divergence. Instead, it can be an avenue of diversification and deeper intimacy. \nThe key to this distinction is intention: Are we seeking total alignment and affirmation for the sake of self-assurance, or are we seeking real and whole understanding of others’ perspectives? Are we willing to make room within ourselves to hold those perspectives, even if they may be different from what we want or believe?\nIn case you’re wondering, all friendships in our group remain alive and well. \nBut towards the end of that long, long night, one of the group observed that it’s pretty rare for friends and other social groups to be able to disagree as intensely as we had done and still be able to carry on with the friendship or social connection. \nI can’t speak for each of them — but for me personally, it’s going to take a lot more than a difference in opinion to break me apart from someone I’ve made a decision to love. \nPerhaps it’s time to start trusting that the bonds we share with our loved ones are a lot stronger than we give them credit for.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nMelissa Lee Suppiah is a deputy editor at TODAY where she oversees commentaries.

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "Whenever someone asks me what I do in a bank, they’re surprised when I tell them I work with migrant workers. \nAs a university graduate with a Bachelor’s degree in business studies and finance, most people expect me to be in corporate or private banking, rubbing shoulders with high-net-worth individuals and the like.\nMy current department handles the work permit segment. When I first joined four years ago, I was concerned about the fluency of my spoken Tamil — but to be honest, I wasn’t too sure about the prospect of working with migrant workers. \nLike many of my friends and relatives, I harboured a jaundiced view of migrant workers at the time, a perception that was probably unhelpfully shaped by the Little India riots in 2013. \nMy parents were concerned as well, but nevertheless I decided to take a leap of faith and try it out. I told myself that there was a job to be done, and I would just go into this with an open mind.\nWithin the first few months of taking on my new role, my misconceptions slowly melted away. As I helped migrant and domestic workers with their account opening and banking enquiries, I found them shy, polite and appreciative of the help rendered to them. \nEven so, it was still a job to me then and nothing more. That was the case until 2020, when I completed one year in the role. \nI remember how I was put in touch with the wife of a migrant worker who had passed away from a workplace incident that fateful year. \nShe had contacted her husband’s employer to seek help for the money in his POSB account to be transferred back to India. \nThat was the very first time my department and I had to assist with a request from a deceased worker’s next-of-kin. \nFrankly, I was worried: What if I made a mistake that could hinder the speedy resolution of the request? I was also sad that a man’s life had ended — what if I couldn’t keep my emotions in check when speaking with his wife?\nShe lived in a small village in Coimbatore, a city in Tamil Nadu, India, and I had to do multiple calls with her to get the required information and documents mailed to Singapore in order to process the remittance request. \nIt was a laborious process as we had to liaise with many different parties. I also had to keep my emotions in check whenever I spoke with the widow. \nI knew I could not do much to assuage her grief, but I resolved to do what was within my means to the best of my ability.\nSo, I expedited the paperwork for the worker’s hard-earned savings to be remitted to his family in India, who urgently needed the money to get by. \nIt took a lot of work, but the wife received the funds within a month. As she expressed her relief and gratitude, it struck me then that my job wasn’t “just a job”. It meant so much more to the people on the receiving end of my assistance. \nFrom that point on, I began to see my role in a new light.\nMy team and I also partner with government agencies and non-government organisations to conduct workshops under the POSB’s Work Permit Holders Digital Literacy programme for migrant and domestic workers. \nAn important aspect of our workshops is teaching these vulnerable groups to identify scam calls and messages such as emails. Foreign domestic workers risk falling prey to scammers with fake job offers promising fast cash, while migrant workers are especially susceptible to scammers posing as government officials.\nWe typically run two workshops a month for up to 200 migrant workers at a time. For domestic workers, because of their rest days, we run workshops on alternate months for between 60 and 80 attendees. \nOne of the main challenges faced by migrant workers is the language barrier, as many of them have limited proficiency in English. This makes it difficult for them to interpret messages effectively, leading to misunderstandings and potential exploitation. \nWorking in a new environment further compounds the risks. As they are unfamiliar with local law processes, this group could be easily cowed into giving away their banking credentials when faced with intimidation or threats by “government officials”. \nAmid the rising prevalence of scams, I wanted to do more to extend and expand our digital literacy outreach to migrant workers. \nIn 2023, I initiated a “train-the-trainer programme” where I would educate a few “big brothers” and “big sisters” as digital literacy ambassadors, so that they could go out and share their knowledge with fellow workers and friends. \nSince the programme’s start, I have personally trained 40 ambassadors.\nAs I continue to become more invested in what I do, I found that my work is not just a job, but also about fulfilling a desire to help the vulnerable. \nBecause migrant and domestic workers work long hours and are often unable to visit bank branches during office hours, I would head out to condominiums, hospitals, and construction sites after office hours and even on weekends, just so I could reach out to these groups. I assist them with their banking queries and difficulties, and listen to them sharing their personal problems. \nMaking sure that my phone is switched on around the clock, I often get WhatsApp messages late at night seeking advice on a myriad of issues.\nI’ve spent the past three Deepavalis at dormitories celebrating the festive occasion with migrant workers, as well as conducting digital literacy sessions on a public holiday. \nAt the beginning, I would tell myself to draw a clearer distinction between work and my personal life, but the more people I met and the more I came to understand their concerns and issues, the more I found myself motivated to help them in whatever little way I could. \nI’ve also found friends: Last year, I invited Krishna — a migrant worker from India and one of the ambassadors I trained — to my house for dinner with my family.\nIt can be lonely being away from your loved ones on a major festive occasion such as Deepavali. It warmed my heart when Krishna thanked me for opening my house to him and allowing him to feel a sense of family on this special day.\nIn a world where self-advancement often takes centre stage, it's easy to turn a blind eye to the struggles faced by others, especially those sidelined to the margins of mainstream society. \nI’ve learnt that it’s important for Singapore to continue amplifying the voices of migrant and domestic workers by providing platforms for them to share their stories and perspectives, and to advocate for themselves, whether through art, media, or community forums.\nWe must also continue to create more inclusive environments that are welcoming and supportive of the vulnerable groups who have travelled far from their homelands and communities to build our houses and roads and look after our parents and children.\nThe past four years have taught me that life is about so much more than chasing the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. In an increasingly digitalised world with widening social and economic inequality, I believe that everyone can give a little of themselves to bring about positive change.\nIn the grand scheme of things, my efforts may be just a ripple — but even the smallest of ripples can become a big wave of change. \nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nRishma Theru, 28, is a business manager for the Work Permit segment at DBS Bank’s consumer banking group."

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "It started with a YouTube video.\nThe year was 2015: During the long wait between junior college and university, I spent my afternoons coaching softball part-time, which meant that I had ample time to kill in the mornings. \nOne morning, a cupcake tutorial by CupcakeJemma popped up on my explore page. Not a lot of people know this, but I’ve got a string of disastrous baking attempts on my record from when I was younger. Even now, I don’t really know what it was that made me want to try out that video — a need to scratch some creative itch? Boredom? A bit of both? \nWhatever it was, this particular batch of cupcakes came out great, much to my own surprise, and got positive feedback from family and friends. \nI immediately started trying out different flavours and variations, fascinated by the way the simple concept of a cupcake could produce countless end results. Within a few months, I was hooked. My baking output quickly outpaced the rate at which my family and friends were consuming my bakes.\nAt that point, I plucked up the courage to create an Instagram page to sell my bakes, soon upgrading from cupcakes to simple cakes. Receiving orders was so exciting; each one was an opportunity to feed my growing interest in baking. \nLooking back on them, I now think those first bakes were horrible — but hey, we all start somewhere. \nAll through university, I spent my weekdays in classes and my weekends baking orders. I appreciated the small side income my “hobby” provided me but, to be perfectly honest, I didn’t have any concrete idea of what I wanted to do with it. \nDoubt loomed in my mind: “Am I good enough to pursue this as a career? Where can this business go? If I commit to this, what will the next few years look like?”\nUpon graduation in July 2019, I told my mum and dad that I wanted to take a stab at turning my home-based side hustle into a full-time job. \nIt took my practical-minded parents some convincing, and I had to make some concessions: I promised them that, should the business not work out after a year, I would pack up my spatulas and find a “regular” corporate job instead. \nConfession: I wasn’t sure I was making the right decision at the time. For all my attempts at allaying my parents’ doubts, my own lingered — but all I knew was that I needed to give my passion for baking a fair shot.  \nFor the next six months, I poured countless hours into recipe development and took on as many orders as I could to grow the business. Frosted by Fang was a one-woman show, and I had to very quickly learn to wear multiple hats at once: Logistics manager, social media marketer, business administrator and customer service officer, all while furthering my own baking self-education.\nThen Covid-19 hit. \nThe world came to a standstill — but my business got a sudden boost. In the midst of lockdowns and minimised socialisation, sending care packages became the new norm, and my mixed dessert boxes, which now included brownies, cookies, tarts and more, quickly became a hit.  \nComing out of the pandemic, I did my very first pop-up at Baker X in mid-2022. It was the first time that I could interact with customers in person, a human element I had been missing as a home-based business. A couple for whom I’d done an order of gender reveal cupcakes in 2019 dropped by with their little one in tow — and it struck me hard how gratifying it was to be, through my bakes, a part of people’s lives and cherished milestones.\nBy then, I’d managed to save up enough to enrol in a two-month pastry course in Bordeaux, France — my first brush with formal baking instruction after years of being entirely self-taught. \nBeing able to work in a larger kitchen with industrial equipment sparked a new dream in me: Could I one day have my own space to bake in? The spark became a flame when I returned to Singapore and realised that my business demands had outgrown the production capacity my home kitchen could offer. \nDespite the success I’d seen up till then, Doubt’s nagging voice lingered in my head. Setting up any kind of physical store would be an uphill task unlike anything I’d faced before, comprising mounds of paperwork, logistical dilemmas and nightmares, and endless planning. But I knew the only way to overcome my reservations was to just bite the bullet. \nAfter a long and rocky location scouting process, I finally found my dream spot in Joo Seng Green, but the space itself was not fit to run a food-and-beverage business in — which meant many more months spent getting approvals for licensing, appropriate alterations and fittings, and so on. \nWith a lot of help from my family, friends and partner, the shop slowly but surely started to take shape. In August 2023, I officially opened its doors for business.\nMy little shop is the hardest thing I have ever done, and it’s still early days, but I have not regretted my decision one bit. With the addition of a physical location, the number of hats I wear has practically doubled. It’s overwhelming at times, but I have never felt more fulfilled. \nThe learning curves along the way were even steeper than I’d anticipated, but I never would have gotten anywhere without them. Every mistake allowed me to better the business and myself. \nMy mother also came onboard as my first (and only) full-time employee, handling front-of-house service in the store. As we grow older, work typically takes us further away from our parents — but I’m grateful for all the time being in the store has allowed my mum and I to spend together and how much closer we’ve gotten because of it.\nMy store also gives me the chance to get to know the residential community and even make friends with many of my newfound regulars. Frosted by Fang would not be where it is today without their generous love and support. \nSometimes I do think it would be nice to have some of the things a “regular” corporate job affords my peers — paid time off, medical coverage, weekends free to spend with loved ones, among others — but ultimately, these are sacrifices worth making in pursuit of my passion for baking.\nWhere will my little “hobby” take me next? I don’t know for sure — but I’ve learnt to accept that my old friend Doubt will still be a visitor from time to time, dropping in and making his uncomfortable presence felt. \nRushing to dismiss him in hopes that he will disappear doesn’t work, though. Rather, I’ve learnt to sit with him for a while and the questions his presence brings, so I can focus on assessing what is within my control and what isn’t. \nMore than that, I’ve learnt not to let Doubt stop me from taking action. The more I do and the more knowledge and experience I gather, the more I can build up my own courage and, eventually, my visitor will naturally take his leave. \nIt’s okay to be afraid; what matters is you do it anyway. \nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nLee Su Fang, 27, is the founder of Frosted by Fang. She has a degree in communications and media studies from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore."

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "“What do you mean, you don’t know?” \nI stared blankly at my boss, totally lost for words. \nThe footnote he was questioning me about stared back at me from the very bottom of a dense document — to some, a small oversight; to me, an indelible hallmark of my latest failure. \nIn my defence, it was among hundreds of documents I was typically assigned to read each night — but this was not the first mistake I would make at this particular job, nor would it be the last. \nThat particular meeting had been a breaking point of sorts. After it, I sat down at my desk and asked myself, for the very first time in my life: “Am I really that bad at what I do?”\nMy father is a self-made man who had climbed the corporate ladder to become chief executive of an international company. He’d ingrained in me from a young age that I should aspire to be “a scholar in the classroom, an athlete on the field, and a master in the performance hall”.\nI was the typical “model student”, graduating with straight As from secondary school and junior college while holding leadership positions in multiple co-curricular activities — captain of the rugby team; vice-president of debate club; even head prefect. \nAt university, I did a double degree in business and law, and took well to both disciplines. I graduated with first-class honours in both my degrees and emerged class valedictorian. \nAfter a short training period at a local law firm, I was invited to work for the Supreme Court, the highest judicial court in Singapore. Only the top 1 per cent of each law cohort receive such invitations, and as a 25-year-old at the start of his professional journey, I felt extremely honoured. \nI loved everything about the job. My bosses were kind, the work meaningful and fulfilling. I had amazing colleagues, many of whom I remain good friends with today. \nUp until that point, I’d never really had any significant setbacks in my life, aside from a few bumps and hitches. I naively assumed the next phase of my career would be just as smooth-sailing. \nAfter a few years, I wanted to delve deeper into the world of business. So I left the Supreme Court and joined a Magic Circle firm (the term bestowed on the five most prestigious multi-national law firms headquartered in London).\nGoing into it, I knew that navigating the jump from public litigation to private corporate work would be difficult — but I saw it as just another challenge which I would successfully tackle. After all, that was what my entire life had set me up to expect, right? \nThe reality could not have been further from my imagination. \nEach day in my new job was a struggle in a way I had never experienced before. \nI struggled to pick up a subject in which I’d had almost no prior exposure. While the firm had offered me a title appropriate for my years of practice and assigned me work accordingly, I struggled to keep up with peers and even juniors with more relevant experience.  \nI struggled to adjust to a new culture and method of learning. In my previous job, I’d been guided by more experienced seniors; here, I was expected to learn everything by myself on the fly. \nI struggled to relate to my bosses, some of whom had different working styles and priorities than I was used to. \nNearly two years and a litany of mistakes later, it was clear that I was not doing well in this job. \nDoubt overtook me — so much so that I went on an introspection exercise, calling up five ex-colleagues and close friends, and asking them to tell me what they thought my strengths and weaknesses were. \nEventually, I had to admit defeat and leave the firm. I was jaded. Tired. Discouraged, and honestly, a little bit lost as to what had happened. \nTwo months later, I joined another practice to pursue tech (something I’d always loved). I worked with startups, venture capital funds, and gaming companies.\nAnd, over time, I started to really enjoy what I do again. \nSome things that helped were a genuine interest in the subject matter, a better culture fit, and a more relatable boss — but here’s what really struck me upon starting anew.\nIt took some time, but it soon dawned on me that I had learnt and grown so much during my years of painful, uncomfortable struggle. The countless nights spent trading sleep for work, the 7.30am meetings (that usually followed a 4am late night), the harsh and sometimes unnecessarily snide remarks. \nSomewhere in the midst of all that struggle, I’d picked up far more than I even realised. Every single mechanism, arrangement, process, and type of agreement — even as I’d been drowning, bit by bit, everything was getting retained in its own way.\nEverything I had learnt then helped me to prosper in the next phase of my career. By drowning a bit (or what felt like a lot), I had somehow learnt how to swim. \nLearning something new is always hard. Sometimes, it’s really hard. \nBut that first intense period of struggle and discomfort is a necessary first hurdle to getting on track.\nGetting in shape? The first 2 km is the worst.\nStamping out bad habits? The first two months are the hardest.\nLearning a new language? The first 10 lessons are the most uncomfortable.\nBut if you keep your head down, and stick to it with perseverance and humility, everything will fall in place. Because failure can really suck — but it can be a great teacher.\nI left legal practice in 2022 to start my own tech company in the blockchain and video gaming space. The last two years have felt almost like a repeat of the two years I spent struggling and drowning in that Magic Circle firm. \nThe patterns are strikingly similar: Jumping into a new discipline; taking on new tasks and responsibilities for the first time; always feeling like I can’t catch up with everyone else who has more experience. My co-founder and I also made our fair share of mistakes as we built the company from the ground up. \nDon’t get me wrong — I still hate failing. But I now see that failure is an essential part of learning. \nIn my new role as a boss, I also find it much easier to empathise with others when mistakes are made. \nAs we step into 2024, I find myself armed with a quiet confidence that the hard work, suffering and struggle will prepare me for whatever will come next. \nOur failures don’t have to define us — with the right attitude and perspective, they can become small but valuable footnotes in our stories, enriching the pages with lessons learned and wisdom earned. \nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nNathanael Lim, 38, is the co-founder of Avium, a venture-backed gaming creator company with presences in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam."

            "Article Body": "Finding joy in motherhood seems to come naturally and easily to most new mothers. \nYet, my own experience revolved mainly around grappling with the demands of parenting, thoughts of my life solely centering on my newborn, and steadily losing my grip on sanity. \nI became a first-time mother in 2017, and suffered from postnatal depression. My focus then was just to get through each day. \nEven though my family was supportive, I still felt overwhelmed and struggled ceaselessly with anxiety and guilt. \nThis was not the first time I’ve experienced an episode of poor mental health, and I knew I had to do something. \nIn my early years as a school teacher, I had faced burnout and exhibited signs of depression. I withdrew from social interactions and lost joy in my day-to-day activities. \nDespite reaching out to professionals for help, I couldn't seem to find a way out. \nIt was through sheer determination and the support of family and friends that I eventually pulled through that dark period.\nWith no prior drawing or illustration background, I started doodling during pockets of free time between motherhood duties — a hobby I embarked on in an attempt to keep my intrusive thoughts at bay. \nI approached my art journey with an open mind, believing that consistent practice leads to progress. \nWhile I lacked formal training, I drew inspiration from other accomplished illustrators on social media who began their careers without prior experience. Their success stories motivated me to invest time and effort into honing my craft.\nThe time spent on art diverted my attention from overthinking, and I also became more mindful of my own thoughts as I learnt to slow them down.\nArt quickly became my most valuable therapeutic outlet, providing solace and aiding my emotional well-being. On difficult days, it helped me to look back on the progress I've made on my mental health journey, reminding me of my own resilience.\nI soon started an Instagram page (@a.kinderspace) as a way to document my own artworks — but I soon found many opportunities to connect with other individuals responding to my struggles, and even sharing their own personal hardships.\nI wound up creating a safe space for sharing relatable mum struggles. \nMost of my inspiration comes from people around me, inadvertently providing solace and encouragement during challenging times. \nSometimes it’s as simple as a quote that I stumble upon online or in a book, or a positive memory from my own life. \nFinding ways to cheer and motivate myself on difficult days can be hard sometimes — but the possibility of my illustrations being able to do the same for others going through tough times of their own is a powerful source of comfort and encouragement.\nMy art journey began as a search for distraction from my thoughts. Funnily enough, it has not only made me more mindful in my thoughts, but has also become a tool to advocate mental wellness — prioritising self-love and normalising speaking up about needing help. \nThe magic lies in being intentional with what we feed our minds, and acknowledging that life has its ups and downs. \nEven now, I am thankful that my illustrations serve a purpose, be it raising awareness about mental health issues or comforting and encouraging someone else in the same mental space as me.\nOur lives are a never-ending race against time.\nThe demands of work, family and personal responsibilities can create a whirlwind of pressure, leaving us grappling with the weight of expectations and the perpetual quest for balance. \nAmid the whirlwind of daily tasks and life's challenges, it's easy to lose sight of our mental well-being. \nCreativity has become an integral part of my life, providing a channel for self-expression and connection with others. \nMy first solo exhibition “Hi K, I’ve Got This: Drawing Perseverance” opened on Nov 2, 2023. My display, made possible by the Singapore Chinese Cultural Centre, offers a visual narrative for the silent battles we fight and the struggles we all endure each day. \nThe featured illustrations centre on a “bungirl” character named K, short for ‘okay’. Through her adventures, K embodies strength, resilience, and the courage to face difficulties head-on. \nEach illustration is a reminder that, despite the chaos, we possess an inner strength capable of weathering life’s storms.\nMy work has always been about embracing imperfections, self-compassion, and dismantling the stigma surrounding mental health challenges.\nBy fostering an open conversation about mental wellness, my art aims to create a space where we can find solace, connection, and inspiration amid life's challenges. For me, this exhibition is another step in my endeavour to encourage myself and others to acknowledge our struggles, and to seek support when we need it.\nThese days, I’ve learned to better regulate my emotions, and to acknowledge that each day, whether positive or challenging, contributes to my personal growth. \nIt’s okay not to be okay. Most importantly, know that no matter the circumstances, there’s always room for hope.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nPaige Lee, is an educator and self-taught illustrator advocating for mental well-being through her illustrations and words via her Instagram page @a.kinderspace. Her exhibition, \"Hi K, I’ve Got This: Drawing Perseverance\",  will be on display at Singapore Chinese Cultural Centre till May 1, 2024. "

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "Unlike the typical Singaporean kid, I was homeschooled for almost all my educational journey since kindergarten. \nMy parents initially chose this path to provide me with a less stressful and more personalised educational experience compared to traditional schooling. \nEven though I had the option to transition to a conventional school after completing my PSLE exams, I remained committed to homeschooling. \nHomeschooling allowed me to enjoy studying while pursuing my hobbies, such as writing and reading. This unconventional approach not only made learning enjoyable during my growing years, but also instilled in me the discipline to manage my time effectively.\nThroughout my homeschooling years, I used relevant curriculum programmes from the United States, which has a more widely established homeschooling scene. I learnt through pre-recorded videos and remote grading by American teachers. \nUpon completing my Primary School Leaving Examinations in 2015, I felt ready to become more independent in my studies.\nBut plans changed when the Covid-19 pandemic hit.  \nMy aspirations to attend university were put on hold when the College Board in the United States discontinued SAT subject tests globally due to the pandemic. I considered Advanced Placement exams, but the lack of prior exposure to relevant courses left me hesitant to continue pursuing self-studies. \nHaving heard of other homeschoolers taking the polytechnic route to university instead, I decided to do so as well.\nAs an avid writer and reader, human behaviour and psychology has always interested me. Thus, I chose to apply to Republic Polytechnic (RP) and secured a spot in the Diploma in Consumer Behaviour & Research course with the US high school diploma from my homeschooling programme.\nTransitioning from homeschooling to a polytechnic setting was initially daunting.  \nThough my experience with co-curricular activities and supportive social circles had equipped me with essential communication skills throughout my homeschooling years, I’m still an introvert at heart. \nI was afraid of entering a new and unfamiliar environment, one where I would be learning alongside classmates. What if I wasn’t able to get along with them?\nDespite my initial apprehension, I was very excited to develop new friendships at polytechnic, even though I was not the most outgoing person. The pandemic had created some “pent-up social needs” in me, as the multiple extended lockdowns had prevented me from attending co-curricular activities and seeing friends in person. \nInstead of focusing on my worries, I set my sights on embracing opportunities to make new friends and catching up quickly in my learning pursuits. I told myself that I would try to be as friendly as possible to every classmate I met. \nI’ve always been pretty articulate and I had no problems speaking up in class, so I was able to perform well in class participation.\nThat said, I was touched whenever my mentor in RP checked in to make sure that I was making friends and adapting well, and to answer my questions on IT matters and school fees. \nDespite the encouraging start, my polytechnic journey was not always smooth sailing. Even so, I tried to see each challenge as an opportunity for growth. \nDaily graded assignments were part of the grind, which I was not used to — while homeschooling, only tests, quizzes, and certain assignments had been graded. But my passion for writing proved extra helpful in staying on top of them.\nThe rigorous demands of regular group projects and presentations allowed me to develop new levels of endurance, confidence, and effective communication skills.\nI particularly enjoyed modules on people and psychology as I’ve always been fascinated by how people think and how their thoughts affect their actions. \nAcademics aside, poly life also offered me many other precious experiences and opportunities for broadening my horizons even further.\nIn my third year, I got an internship opportunity at a leading market research company, NielsenIQ.\nGetting to learn more about people from the marketing perspective was so exciting, and I even got to participate in the conduct of real-world market research. \nThe internship taught me more about how to communicate professionally and effectively with colleagues and to be more confident in my own abilities as I continued to grow my knowledge.\nAfter that, I had the opportunity to serve as a student leader on an international service learning trip to Batam, where we taught local kindergartners basic lessons in Mathematics, English, dance, and sports. \nDuring the trip, we had to improvise due to the language barrier. It was the first time I’d had the opportunity to reflect on how learning English can be a different experience for non-native speakers.\nThis was a valuable experience that showed me how my skills and knowledge could be put towards making a positive impact on communities in need.\nAll in all, as much as I had enjoyed homeschooling, it was fun to have classmates for once. The workload in RP could be tough at times, but working alongside friends made it more manageable.\nI graduated from RP on May 7, 2024.\nLooking back, my polytechnic experience turned out to be a transformative journey. Despite my initial concerns about the forced deviation from my original education plans, transiting to “normal” schooling had provided me with invaluable lessons, diverse experiences and meaningful connections.\nAll of these have profoundly shaped my growth both as a student and as a person. \nThe most impactful aspect of my experience at RP was the confidence I developed. It helped me not to fear changes and challenges, but to have faith in my own abilities.  \nI also learnt how important companionship could be on a big journey like education. While homeschooling worked for me, it could also get pretty lonely at times as I didn’t have anyone to discuss my work or progress with. \nBeing in RP was a good change for me, as I got to work alongside peers, and discuss and exchange ideas with them. It was nice to feel like I was part of a group. \nPost-graduation, I intend to pursue a degree in Linguistics, driven by my fascination with the intricacies of language. \nWhatever path I choose, I know that many more opportunities for growth await me. \nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nArista Loh, 20, recently graduated from Republic Polytechnic with a diploma in consumer behaviour & research. She has a passion for writing and strives to become a better writer every day."

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "My issues with my appearance first started during puberty. \nI had gone through the regular cycle of a growth spurt, marked by big changes in my height and weight; but nothing could’ve prepared me for how much my bust would grow. \nIn Primary 5, a classmate looked at me and said, “Dude, I can see your boobs. They’re so obvious, did you wear a bra?” \nI had, of course, worn a bra — but the embarrassing call-out opened my eyes to notice, for the first time, that my bust was larger than everyone else’s. I also noticed that my thighs had become thicker; the skinny, pre-puberty body I had was gone. \nIt clicked in my head that the way I looked could be an uncomfortable sight in the eyes of those around me because it went against the grain of Southeast Asian beauty standards. \nI had always been encouraged by my mum to embrace how I looked and be comfortable in my own skin. But from this point on, I suddenly realised how societal beauty standards place us all under intense scrutiny and pressure, even at such a young age. \nOver the next few years, it became more and more apparent that my figure was different. \nBeing heavily invested in fashion, I was acutely conscious of how certain clothes would look on me and the reactions it could warrant. I would pay attention to the forecasted designs from fashion week and other catalogues or style icons of the mid- to late 2010s. \nLabels like Brandy Melville caught my eye, a trendsetting brand known for catering to ultra-skinny girls. Each time I visited the store with friends, I would wait outside the changing room and look at them trying on piece after piece, thinking of how these pretty clothes could never look good on me. \nIn my naivety, I thought that the style icons of the time — Gigi Hadid, Blake Lively, Kylie Jenner — set the standard of what women should aspire to look like. I strived to replicate their outfits and appearances. Pop culture influences such as these illustrated the silhouette that I “should” have. \nIt was impossible, no matter how many diets or exercise regimes I tried. \nOne reason why is that my body looked good the way it was. I wasn’t overweight; I just wasn’t the size-zero model you see on magazine covers or when you’re shopping online. Any professional stylist would also tell you that the type of wardrobe that is suitable for you is very dependent on your figure and your features. \nWhile I understood the concept, I struggled to actively apply it. \nFor my 18th birthday, I wanted to wear a gingham-patterned crop top purchased for the occasion. When I tried it in-store, it seemed to fit — but on the day itself, my reflection seemed foreign, and thoughts of how I despised the way I looked swirled in my head. I felt “unworthy” of pretty clothes. \nAll through ages 18-22, I embarked on various diet plans and exercise regimes to achieve a figure that I could be happy with. \nIt worked out most of the time, but whatever results I obtained came at the cost of my health. There were days I would forgo entire meals just to feel “healthier”. This was a short-term solution, of course, because I would always find newer problems to pick at: ‘My nose is not small enough’, ‘My jawline can be sharper’, ‘My tummy is not flat enough after meals’.\nIn the last few years, the world has seen an increased representation of women with a variety of body shapes and types in the media, like Kat Dennings and Ashley Graham. Such representation encouraged me to work harder on positively affirming my body and the way I looked. \nI took up pilates, each session of which concluded with the instructor inviting us into a moment of gratitude for our bodies taking us through the exercise and for all it does. \nThese helped me forge a more wholesome mirror through which to see myself: “I’m thankful I have a tummy that protects vital organs like my uterus,” I started to think. “My thicker thighs support me during muscle training.”\nBit by bit, I managed to build a newfound confidence that made me feel more beautiful. I learnt that I am healthy and uniquely me, and any modification to my looks should be an enhancement of myself, rather than a “necessary” improvement. \nConfession: Despite the strides I’ve made, I still struggle from time to time — when I’m bloated after a meal, for example, or indulging in unhealthy snacks when I have not been working out for a while.      \nI take a longer look in the mirror to identify my “flaws” and how to get rid of them. Sometimes, I even have a difficult time leaving the house, because the thought of putting on an outfit that can make me feel good is a heavy weight (no pun intended). \nWhat helps a lot is remembering that being loved is so much more important than being skinny — my friends and family remind me of this every time they tell me I look beautiful even when I am overthinking an outfit.\nThrough social media platforms like TikTok, I’ve been able to see so many women of different shapes and sizes and know that my struggles with my body is a shared, universal experience. It’s comforting to see styling videos where a girl might have a bit of a tummy like me wearing a low-waist skirt, or a busty girl donning a top that heavily accentuates her curves. \nI’ve come a long way, but I’m still a work in progress. What I can share is this: If you’re struggling like me, it helps to first redefine beauty for yourself. \nTo me, beauty is no longer about a number on a scale; it’s about presenting the best version of myself to the world and doing what makes me feel good. If a simple jeans and T-shirt combination is what makes me feel comfortable, I know that I am gorgeous.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nLarissa Santhana Nair, 23, makes sense of life and its complexities through song, dance and the occasional burrito.

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "My partner and I crossed paths towards the end of 2019, while studying at different universities in Edinburgh, Scotland.\nWe were set apart from the start: He’s from Malaysia, and I’m from Singapore. But we didn’t expect to be parted from each other so soon.\nWe spent just two months together before the Covid-19 pandemic struck, forcing us back to our home countries. \nThus began a 15-month stretch of long-distance dating, divided into two legs — one from March to September 2020, and another from May 2021 to January 2022.\nHaving never visited each other’s cities, we struggled to visualise each other’s daily lives and relied heavily on video calls and photographs. But even with modern technology, connection across physical separations cannot be guaranteed. \nCountless conversations got cut short due to poor Wi-Fi or last-minute plans. Given that we hadn’t spent much time together in person, virtual communication proved tricky as we were not used to each other’s tones and reactions, which sometimes caused frustration and disappointment — the core of which was a sense of disconnection and a desire to hash it out in person. \nCoupled with the uncertainties of the ongoing pandemic, there were times it felt tortuous and never-ending.\nOn the flip side, being closed off from the outside world made us more open and vulnerable with each other. Early in the relationship, we set boundaries, discussed fears and anxieties, and swapped childhood stories.\nIn September 2020, Singapore’s borders with Malaysia were tightly shut and would stay so until 2022.\nWe chose to spend the next eight months continuing our studies together in Scotland. But the reunion, though long-awaited, initially felt bittersweet and strange. After becoming accustomed to seeing and hearing each other through video and flattened digital transmissions, meeting in person felt almost like encountering a stranger.\nWe had to get accustomed to physical habits and relearn routines, both our own and each other’s. It also felt like we had a silent agreement to cherish the limited time together. After all, we didn’t know when the next bout of long distance would start again.\nTruth be told, this made for a lot of particularly hard, isolated days during this time — but I wouldn’t exchange the toughest of these for anything. It taught me not to take things for granted, not even mundane things like getting groceries or doing laundry together.\nStill, doubts lingered in my mind: With him graduating and returning to Malaysia while I still had a year left in Scotland, how long would this last? Even if we did make it through all that, how were we going to eventually close the gap?\nWhen the eight months were up, it was a harder goodbye because there was no end in sight. I knew this second round of long-distance was going to be even tougher than the first.\nI was in my final year of university, with assignments, exams and my dissertation at their most intense. My partner found a job in Malaysia that took up much of his time. Further complicating things was an eight-hour time difference, which we had to spend much of our limited free time contending with and working around. \nThroughout it all, the uncertainty of when we could bridge the geographical gap between us weighed heavily on our minds.\nWe learned the importance of compromise, putting effort into changing our routines in order to match up free times, and communicating as much as possible. We made intentional efforts to strengthen our bond: Virtually meeting each other’s families, sharing an account for updates on days we couldn’t talk, and even starting a “count-up” log to track our time apart, which motivated us to keep going on difficult days. \nWe scheduled date nights — and didn’t skimp on them either, indulging in multiplayer Steam games, karaoke sessions, movie nights on platforms like Scener, and sending gifts and food to each other’s families.\nWe also started getting on Skype calls not to talk, but to leave a window of connection open as we went about our routines, allowing us to share mundane aspects of our lives with each other and building our shared intimacy in a way that did not impede our schedules and commitments.\nUpon graduating, I returned to Singapore in May 2022. The opening of Singapore's borders with Malaysia in December 2021 had also brought a profound sense of relief. While the physical separation remained, knowing that we were no longer restricted by closed borders was a big load off our minds.\nMy partner quickly secured a job in Singapore and moved here, a transition that presented brand new challenges: From balancing family visits in both countries to making decisions about settling down and housing arrangements, all while striving for a work-life balance.\nBeing in the same city brought comfort, allowing us to explore each other's childhood neighbourhoods, meet each other's families and friends, and immerse ourselves in each other's lives and cultures.\nDespite my partner’s constant reassurances, the sacrifices he’s made to leave his home country for mine weigh on me. He can't see his family and friends as frequently as before, and misses significant events like birthdays and funerals.\nOn my end, I try to help him plan out his leaves and flights, and accompany him whenever he goes back to Malaysia — aiming to support him while building stronger connections with his family.\nDating long-distance for as long as we did definitely affected our relationship, especially at such a young age. But it made a lot of positive impact too. \nOne example is the evolution of our communication: Moments where we struggled to understand each other's tone and body language taught us to share our thoughts and feelings with each other more directly and openly.\nOur long-distance stints have also underscored the importance of a strong foundation and friendship in a romantic relationship. Without a mutual commitment to building a strong emotional bond and supporting each other through hard days, any obstacles — geographical distance included — can feel overwhelming.\nWe're fortunate that our families have been incredibly supportive from the beginning, taking time to get to know each other over meals and consistently prioritising our needs and aspirations. It couldn't have been easy for them to watch us embark on this journey amid the uncertainties of the pandemic.\nAny long-distance relationship isn't easy, whether it’s romantic or otherwise — but they also offer plenty of opportunities that would be impossible in a “conventional” relationship. If you keep the faith and hope, the distance stops being a hindrance and becomes an incredible means of deeper connection.\nAs for me, I’ve stopped fixating on the obstacles in my way. Instead, I’m choosing to focus on how we’re going to overcome them together.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nNicole Chan, 24, is a communications strategist by trade, and a digital native by passion.

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "Growing up, I’d always felt limited in buying new things. My family was financially comfortable but never rich, and my mother had to keep a tight hand on our purse strings at times. \nUpon becoming a working adult, receiving a pay cheque and controlling how it’s used was an immeasurably exciting concept. \nStarting out, I was uncompromisingly thrifty with my hard-earned money. I used Grab rides and food delivery services only for work; I did most of my shopping on Shopee and Shein; I ate out twice a week at most, keeping it to a maximum of S$30 each time. \nBut the rigidity eventually tired me out. Endlessly scrolling through TikToks of people living their best Eat, Pray, Love lives convinced me that I should make the most out of my youth and create the life I desire. \nMoney, I fatefully decided, can be earned back — but not vibes.\nI wasted no time in changing my lifestyle accordingly: I used ride-hailing services whenever I felt like it, and at least one new piece of clothing was added to my wardrobe every week. I became a magpie – except that it didn’t have to be shiny to catch my eye and get me to open my wallet! \nSure, I would still try to save about S$200 a month, but any savings I accumulated screamed “extra spending” to me — which would eventually lead me to a financial rock bottom. \nI was on holiday in Melbourne this October enjoying the cold spring weather, the many thrift shopping options, and the delicious coffee and food. \nRunning low on spending money, I pulled up my banking app to transfer money into my travel e-wallet and stared in dismay at my phone: I had only S$20 left in my account. \nThankfully, I had extra cash on hand to tide me through to the next day, when I received my salary. But that new pay cheque did not last as long as it should have: Come Nov 1, I found myself yet again facing the exact same conundrum. \nWith only S$400 left until the next payday, I was anxious about how I’d survive the next three weeks. What about team lunches during work-from-office days? How would I afford transportation? \nI also found myself grappling with a fear I’ve never known before: This was the very first time in all 23 years of my life that I did not have a cushion of savings that I or my family could rely upon in an emergency. I berated myself for not being more prudent the months before.\nWhile I could blame a culture of consumerism, I admit that there really is something so comforting in buying something when you are having a tough time — after all, it’s called retail “therapy” for a reason.\nBut treating myself for tackling day-to-day tasks or just because “I deserve it” had turned into such a normalised coping mechanism that it had become unquestioningly harmful to my financial and mental health. \nThe self-control I’d exercised since childhood was switched off for such a short period of time, but had come so close to wrecking my life. \nI knew I had no time to waste. Immediately, I started budgeting for the rest of the month. \nInstead of eating Italian fusion food from a Tipo restaurant (about S$25), I headed to Saizeriya for my pasta fix (S$8).\nI forced myself to wake up half an hour earlier for work and scheduled all meetings 15 minutes earlier than I needed to be there in my personal calendar, and managed to avoid resorting to cabs and Grabs. \nDigging through my mountain pile of clothes, I resignedly listed the ones I knew I could instantly earn cash from on Carousell. I made S$20 in a week, financing two work-from-office meals. \nMore importantly, I embarked on a ‘No Buy November’ ban till my next pay cheque. This meant I had to turn a blind eye to the typical bevy of sales launched during this month — 11.11, Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and more. \nFrankly, I thought this would be impossible. My friends, while supportive, had a hard time believing I would be able to persevere through it as well. \nTo my surprise, this new mission became an eye-opener for me: I learnt that I can appreciate an item — bags, jewellery, even simple things like stationery — without spending money on it. \nThe one silver lining of my shopaholic tendencies? All the CapitaStar points I’d racked up went towards necessary toiletries. It inspired me to become a full-fledged “auntie” and start collecting points on other platforms with benefits. \nMy crisis management measures paid off. I made it to my next payday — with S$30 to spare.\nThroughout my no-buy ban, I saw multiple items I desperately wanted to buy in the moment — but looking back now, I cannot specifically name a single one. \nThis brought me to another revelation: On rough days, I feel justified to shop freely because I want to feel better, but with such impulse purchases, the rush of joy is only fleeting. I did not actually want the item I bought — rather, I liked the idea that I could have it. \nFollowing my brush with financial ruin, I resolved to turn my bad money habits around. \nI became diligent in tracking my expenses throughout the month with a handy Notion template. Its clear and neat categorisations help me easily understand how and where I’m spending my money. \nThis also helps me pare down on unnecessary costs. For example, this showed me that I’ve been subscribed to certain services that no longer benefit me and it might be time to end them. \nA friend of mine has a “shopping risk analysis” system, calculating each item’s cost per wear: If a bag costs S$45 and can be used at least 45 times, the “value” of that bag is approximately S$1. If an item’s “value” does not hit close to S$1, he shelves the idea of buying it. I keep this in mind now whenever something catches my eye.\nI still buy things I want — but not all of them, and no longer on impulse. \nWhen you have a goal or purpose for your savings, it helps make the scrimping worthwhile. With a dream to move abroad someday, I definitely need a good amount of savings to fall back on.\nThis may sound like a contradiction to what I’ve shared so far, but there is undoubtedly a beauty in shopping and treating yourself — when done in moderation. Each of us have our own personal style and character, and there’s no harm in expressing these in the clothes we don or the little trinkets we put up on our shelves and walls. \nHowever, I’ve learnt that responsible spending is about embracing personal style while resisting the urge to conform. Social media continues to expose me to a never-ending parade of shiny new microtrends and aesthetics, but I now understand that appreciating them does not mean I have to adopt them all. \nReal talk: I don’t think I will ever completely eradicate frivolous consumerism from my life — but I can confidently say that its hold on me has drastically weakened. \nWith good planning and intentionality, it’s possible for me to shop consciously and authentically express myself without breaking the bank.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nLarissa Santhana Nair, 23, makes sense of life and its complexities through song, dance and the occasional burrito.

            "Article Body": "Every Jan 1 in the Yamato-Leow household, soft and chewy mochi will be placed on the dining table at home – part and parcel of my family’s tradition in welcoming the Japanese New Year, also known as Oshogatsu.\nAnd typically about a month later, my household awakens to vibrant hues of red and gold as well as inverted “fu” calligraphy decorations adorning our walls, as the Chinese side of my family celebrates the Lunar New Year.\nIt is through these traditions and festivals that I am constantly reminded of how closely intertwined my Japanese and Chinese roots are. \nBut as I grew up, I am often asked which part of my heritage I identify with more.\nI learnt as a young girl how complex the concept of identity is, growing up as a Singaporean-Japanese who has also lived for a time in the United States, China and Canada, before finally moving here 14 years ago.\nToday, I understand that humans are not monolithic creatures and it is never about choosing one culture over the other. \nYet, as a kid, there were moments I felt confused as to who I was, especially when I lived in places where there were certain cultural expectations and stereotypes. \nFor example, while I was living in Singapore, the accent I picked up from living in the US and going to international schools in China led most people to assume that I wasn’t Singaporean. Conversely, when I travelled to North America, I would get compliments like “Your English is really good!”. Naturally, as a child, I would get confused about what parts of me I was meant to identify with. \nI’ve learnt that when it comes to being at peace with my dual heritage, it's not about looking at the differences between my Singaporean and Japanese backgrounds or the cultural environment I grew up in, but being able to embrace how different cultures can have amazing similarities.\nSuch as the case with the Japanese and Chinese New Years, which have similar practices such as the giving of hongbaos and or \"otoshidama\" (\"lucky money\" in Japanese) in red packets from elders to children.\nI know that I didn't belong to only one world, but I had the privilege to dip my toes into both.\nBecause I was brought up to appreciate the rich diversity of peoples and cultures around the world, I would bring that spirit with me during my travels, constantly going off the beaten track to learn more about how other people live.\nInstead of attractions that occupy the usual tourist itineraries and sit on Top 10 lists, I found myself gravitating towards places that represent the diverse heartbeat of the city or town that I was in.\nI loved the suburban Vietnamese restaurants in the US, the park playgrounds near family friends’ houses, the (super-sized) bags of snacks in grocery stores, and the various watering holes where serendipitous encounters and varied conversations happen.\nI also sought out unique experiences as a solo traveller, recently visiting Spain, Japan and Vietnam on my own.\nAs a young adult, solo travel was never about getting away, but about understanding myself better, to push boundaries and face fears head-on. Each trip is an introspection and an opportunity to grow. \nTo help travellers discover and understand the cultural significance of attractions, I worked together with a team of fellow travel and tech enthusiasts to develop Wunderguide, an artificial intelligence tour guide that helps save hours of sifting through reviews, websites, and maps across multiple apps. \nIt was this yearning to immerse oneself into the pulse of every destination that we decided to create Wunderguide not just as another travel tool, but as a bridge to help travellers easily find answers to their questions and understand their destinations.\nNevertheless, the best experiences are often spontaneous, as I’ve found. Last July, I found myself travelling to the vast steppes of Mongolia.\nThere, I would discover a wordless form of human connection while staying in a traditional ger, the yurt-like dwelling that has housed nomads for centuries.\nEvery communication with my nomadic hosts involved a tentative dance of gestures and smiles. In spite of this language hurdle, we were able to understand each other.\nWhat made the difference was the mutual desire on both sides to share aspects of our own culture, which was a kind of universal language of its own.\nThat mutual connection was how I was able to try my hand at the age-old practice of shearing a sheep with a pair of scissors. \nWhile I was clumsy in my first few attempts, my hosts responded to my earnest desire to learn their ways, and instructed me kindly as if they were teaching their own daughter how to survive in the wild plains.\nApart from the occasional laughter from the hosts when I made a mistake, there was mostly just a lot of silent gesturing. But I could sense that they shared my happiness when I finally learned the ropes.\nAdmittedly, all I had to offer in return was some of my snacks and coffee from my previous trip to South Korea, but they later returned the favour by inviting me to share with them a traditional meal of khorkhog, a type of stone-grilled meat.\nTo me, it felt like I was learning meaningfully and being accepted by another culture other than my own. Beyond the boundaries of being Singaporean or Japanese, I felt like someone more.\nMy visit to the Mongolian countryside has since become a core memory. As a 23-year-old who is now back amidst the familiar hum of urban life, I have been reflecting on my experience in the ger, trying to integrate what I learnt into my daily life. \nI’ve come to the realisation that travel is not about the miles covered, but the memories made and the life lessons picked up along the way. \nFor one, I've made an effort to be more patient, taking the time to connect with those around me even if the first step is the hardest. \nI’ve also tried to temper my urge to seek out instant gratification and be more mindful, remembering the peaceful solitude and the timeless nature of the grassy plains of Mongolia. \nI will also not forget the importance of observing and listening as opposed to filling silence with chatter, because sometimes silence can speak volumes.\nFor my fellow female solo travellers, there will of course be some trepidation being so far away from home on our own.\nApart from the oft-cited and correct advice of doing proper research beforehand about cultural norms and keeping trusted ones informed about your movements, there are also ways for female travellers to not let fear hinder genuine experiences.\nFor one, opting for homestays can be wise, as staying with local family hosts provides an intimate glimpse into the region's lifestyle and traditions.\nConnecting with other travellers also helps –  platforms like Hostelworld can help you meet other travellers. For many cities, there are Facebook groups that cater specifically to female travellers.\nIt goes without saying that safety is paramount, which is why having a friendly face in the vicinity is key.\nWhether it is the vibrant canals of Amsterdam, the bucolic Mongolian countryside, hectic Hong Kong or the tranquil streets of San Sebastian, I firmly believe that solo travel doesn't mean travelling alone.\nRather, it means interacting more with locals who can come from vastly different backgrounds. Doing so can enrich our own life and help us figure out our own place in the world.\nAfter all, identity isn't a static entity sealed within predefined societal boxes decided from birth.\nI may be Japanese and Chinese, but my identity is also the sum of all the places I've lived in and travelled to, like a patchwork of experiences and memories that define me as a person.\nAnd each step I take into a new place or a new experience enlarges this rich tapestry by weaving in new threads, including those made from Mongolian wool.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nAmelia Yamato Leow, 23, is a Business Analytics major with a love for travel, nature, and culinary adventures. Her weekends are often a blend of family gatherings, hangouts with friends, playing with her dog, working on Wunderguide, and reading a new book. Her book recommendation is Sweet Bean Paste by Durian Sukegawa, which offers the poignant reflection: “All experience adds up to a life lived as only you could. I feel sure the day will come when you can say: this is my life.” "

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "Growing up in Singapore, my life has been a colourful tapestry of diverse cultures and languages.\nMy journey has been one of self-discovery, introspection, and a profound appreciation for racial harmony.\nFrom enjoying various cuisines at hawker centres to celebrating festive occasions with friends of different ethnic and religious groups, I am thankful for living in a diverse country that celebrates multiculturalism.\nBut for those with complex ancestry like me, who find ourselves at the intersection of different cultures, it is often the case that we have to grapple with the complex concept of identity. \nYou see, my forefathers came from diverse backgrounds, including of Eurasian, Indian, and Peranakan origins. \nMy grandparents and great-grandparents lived in a typical Singaporean kampung and spoke Malay.\nOn the other hand, my maternal grandfather hailed from Pondicherry and was a Malayalee who spoke English, Malayalam, and Tamil. When he came to Singapore in the 1930s, he married my grandmother and picked up Malay conversationally. \nAnd so, while English became the sole language spoken at home by my entire family, I studied Malay in school, despite it being customary for most Indian students to learn Tamil in Singapore. \nLet me just say that I deeply appreciate how harmony between different races has been such an integral part of my family history and my own life.\nWith my mixed heritage, I take immense pride in my identity as an Indian girl. \nNevertheless, despite Singapore being multicultural, some people have found my background confusing.\nAlthough my South Asian roots primarily trace back to Tamil origins, like I said earlier, I do not speak the language.\nWhen I was younger, this caused an identity crisis for me. Unlike my friends who learned and spoke their mother tongues, and were thus able to connect with their culture through language, I couldn’t do the same.\nLanguage was just one aspect that contributed to my sense of being different. As Catholics, my family celebrates Easter and Christmas, and we do not observe Hindu festivals like Holi or Deepavali. \nI have been ridiculed for both my unfamiliarity with popular Bollywood music and films and my limited tolerance for spicy food.\nOver time, I became aware of some unfair judgements that people have made about my cultural background. \nIt troubled me greatly that my inability to speak Tamil or follow certain practices painted me as a “fake Indian”, and true enough, others have called me that before.\nI was deeply distressed by the thought of not holding up to the image that many people have about Indians. \nThankfully, I no longer hold such beliefs now. Just because I do not know how to speak Indian languages or follow cultural traditions does not make me less of an Indian. \nOver the years, I took it upon myself to learn more about Indian culture to deepen my connection with my heritage.\nThrough literature and university courses, I delved into the history of Indians in Singapore and the myriad traditions of different Indian groups such as Gujarati and Maharashtrian, I eagerly engaged my lecturers with questions that they have always graciously answered.\nFor example, I enrolled in a “South Asia in Singapore\" course at the National University of Singapore, where I learnt about the historical context and migration patterns of South Asians here spanning from the colonial era to the contemporary period. \nThe course underscored the remarkable diversity among South Asians in Singapore, highlighting variations in their origins, languages, and religious affiliations, thereby dispelling the notion of a homogeneous South Asian community.\nMoreover, I found joy in sharing my cultural journey with loved ones who have happily joined me in my visits to the museums and heritage trails. This year alone, I have visited the Indian Heritage Centre in Little India three times.\nParticipating in community events is also a wonderful way to connect with people from different backgrounds and understand different cultures. \nI regularly volunteer at my neighbourhood’s community club, and I have had the pleasure of teaming up with a diverse group of friends to create a music video for a Deepavali celebration.\nWe filmed in Little India, engaging with various shopkeepers, and immersing ourselves in their traditional trades. We embraced the spirit of Deepavali by dressing up in colourful ethnic costumes and partaking in the festivities.\nWe learned about the significance of Deepavali and the vibrant celebrations, such as preparing delicious delicacies like gulab jamun and creating Rangoli patterns using coloured powders to usher prosperity.\nAnother community event that gave me new insights were the Racial Harmony Day carnival celebrations on July 21, featuring an array of fun segments like musical performances and writing Chinese calligraphy. \nThese activities cultivated my appreciation for different cultures and revealed historical significance, like the Indian origin of Snakes and Ladders, also known as \"Parama Padam.\"\nFood stalls at the carnival offer beloved dishes from various cuisines, such as Chinese popiah and Peranakan laksa. \nIt is always heart-warming to watch others, regardless of ethnicity or religion, bonding and celebrating our multicultural society. \nSuch cultural exchange fosters a shared identity as Singaporeans. To me, this intermingling of cultures within the community is what creates a sense of belonging and strengthens social bonds.\nIt is what helps to nurture a unique Singaporean identity that is rooted in unity and acceptance.\nAt 23, with growing confidence and self-assurance in my identity, I learned that labelling individuals based on their languages or cultural practices is futile. \nInstead of labels, which serve to put people into boxes, I found that we should all welcome the idea of learning about one another's beliefs and practices because this  helps to dispel misconceptions and find common ground.\nToday, my passion for learning more about Indian culture has remained strong as I find that connecting with one's heritage is an ongoing and fulfilling process. \nDuring my summer break this year, I had the valuable opportunity to intern with the Singapore Indian Development Association (Sinda), a self-help group supporting the Indian community. \nMy days there gave me further insights into cultural activities and their significance. \nMy colleagues were touched by my desire to connect with my roots and taught me Tamil phrases eagerly, without any judgement that I wasn’t able to speak the language.\nSuch experiences not only deepened my understanding of Indian culture but also allowed me to share my background with others and fostered a mutual appreciation for different cultures. \nI firmly believe that racial harmony forms an essential aspect of the social defence pillar of Total Defence, as it strengthens social cohesion. By nurturing a sense of responsibility towards one another, we can all contribute to the well-being of the broader community and help build a united and strong Singapore.\nAlthough Racial Harmony Day is not officially observed at work or in tertiary educational institutions, I believe that it is necessary as it serves as a reminder to cherish the unique blend of cultures that coexist harmoniously in Singapore.\nIn Singapore, with its diverse individuals from various backgrounds, some of us may encounter instances of racism and discrimination.\nCelebrating racial harmony helps to foster appreciation for each other's traditions, values, and histories, enriching the tapestry of Singaporean society. It is a part of our daily lives. \n I believe this is how we can continue paving the way for a more inclusive and harmonious society.\nAs a mixed-heritage individual, my journey towards self-acceptance was made possible because I felt empowered to learn more about my own identity. \nI have come to appreciate the beauty of different cultures and recognise the importance of fostering understanding among my peers.\nIt has been a long journey but I am proud of who I am. \nLike my favourite Singaporean dish, rojak, I am a mix of various ingredients and spices, a vibrant amalgamation of cultures and traditions.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nDarcel Anastasia Al Anthony, 23, is a final-year student at the National University of Singapore."

            "Article Body": "Singapore has about 450 active ground-up initiatives, made up of groups of individuals who come together in self-organised projects to help the community. TODAY's Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young changemakers and the stories behind their initiatives. \nHere, Ms Tamara Tan Ann, 24, recounts her journey with 32 Pages, an initiative that aims to provide empathetic spaces for children to learn. What began as a volunteering stint blossomed into a programme that reshaped Miss Tan’s own narrative about her childhood.  \nI was not always drawn to children. There was a time I disliked them and saw them as immature, entitled and unmanageable. \nThis might sound strange coming from a co-founder of 32 Pages — a ground-up initiative started in 2021 that helps children build motivation and resilience in learning. \nMy change of heart was a surprise to me, too. It all began with serving children in the community.\nAs a psychology undergraduate in 2021 who was yearning for hands-on experience in the field, I sought internships that would equip me with the tools to provide therapeutic support to children and adolescents in the future.\nAfter learning ways to manage children’s behaviour and nurture their socio-emotional development, I was eager to apply these skills in a relevant setting.\nFast-forward to 2024 — Chloe Ng, Cheryl Lee and I have been running 32 Pages for nearly three years.\nWhat began as a volunteering stint to serve communities living in rental flats and to hone my skills soon morphed into a profound journey that reshaped not only my perception of children, but also the course of my career.\nOur initial programme, Little Readers: Big Dreams, focused mainly on English literacy for children aged four to 10.\nIt was met with tantrums, inattention and other classroom avoidant behaviours that tested our teaching prowess.\nThis pushed us to confront a pressing need we saw within children in these communities — emotional resilience.\nRecognising this gap, we modified the programme to integrate socio-emotional growth as well, to develop motivation and resilience in learning among children.\nWhile our curriculum incorporates diverse tools — ranging from storybooks and worksheets to crafts and games — the crux of our approach centres on adult modelling.\nWe see ourselves as our children’s role models, leading by example to show them how to navigate the world with empathy and resilience. In essence, we as adults shape their journey through our own actions and examples.\nToday, 32 Pages has served more than 100 children across three neighbourhoods — Redhill, Henderson and Bukit Panjang — with the help of a supportive voluntary community of more than a dozen members who feel as strongly about our children’s potential.\nWe have also received support from partners such as South Central Community Family Service Centre, Leng Kee Community Club, and We Love Learning Centre, among others.\nThe most impactful story for me comes from my interaction with a five-year-old boy who quickly became the nightmare of every volunteer during our time at Bukit Merah. He was the “naughty kid”, “problematic child” and “hyperactive boy”.\nIt was difficult to work with him; he was disobeying instructions by refusing to sit properly and not taking part in our activities. It was after working with him for quite some time that I realised the problem. We were not listening to him.\nI should have known this; I was once a child who felt like her opinions were sidelined and actions were misinterpreted as defiance. \nRather than reprimanding him for his outbursts, I made it a point to sit with him and hear his side of the story. Over time, as I listened, he reciprocated in engagement and participation, and even began to enjoy our shared reading sessions.\nMy experience at 32 Pages has taught me that children fall behind not for a lack of resources, but because they associate learning spaces with negative experiences and feelings. \nThe places we inhabit and the people we meet influence the stories we tell ourselves — about who we are and the people we can become.\nThat is why we also train our volunteers to build meaningful relationships and hone emotional literacy — to allow children to feel heard in their struggles.\nOther times, the struggles we faced were more practical.\nOur programme relies heavily on the dedication of our volunteers, who enable us to provide one-to-one support for our children. Yet, sustaining this weekly commitment over a 10-week period, alongside full-time studies or jobs, is no easy task.\nWhat keeps us going is the improvement we see in children, such as witnessing them take deep breaths to soothe tantrums and having them share their lives, worries and aspirations with us.\nFor children, suppressing these feelings translates into “challenging behaviour”. Instead of recoiling at such outbursts, I have found it empowering to treat these moments as opportunities for understanding what might be holding them back from learning.\nWe believe our work also helps build up a generation of adults who can provide an empathetic space for children to grow. It not only encourages us to withhold personal judgement and model empathy towards children, but also towards ourselves.\nOver time, I’ve come to realise: I didn’t like children. It was because I felt disliked as a child. This was a personal narrative that fuelled my desire to support others who shared similar experiences.\nHowever, even though personal stories inspire us to foster change, it’s the stories born from that change that will keep us going.\nAs changemakers, instead of dwelling on our personal past, we should focus on future narratives — new narratives that unfold within the lives of those we serve, the volunteers who join us in our mission, and even deep within ourselves.  \n\nABOUT THE WRITER: \nTamara Tan Ann, 24, is the co-founder of 32 Pages and works full-time as an associate psychologist. She graduated from the National University of Singapore in 2023 with a psychology major and communications and new media minor. She is passionate about building empathetic and meaningful relationships with children that inspire self-growth and resilience. \n32 Pages is supported by Bagus Together, an initiative that helps changemakers and ground-ups start and sustain their work.\n\nIf you have an experience to share or know someone who wishes to contribute to this series, write to voices@mediacorp.com.sg with your full name, address and phone number."

            "Article Body": "I refer to TODAY’s report on why the 2026 Commonwealth Games is struggling to find a host.\nWith the 2026 games seemingly doomed to be cancelled due to lack of a host, the Commonwealth of Nations may want to consider decentralising future events to several host cities instead.\nThis can significantly reduce the costs of hosting the games, particularly the need to  build new facilities which risks being underutilised after the event.\nSeveral different cities, or even small nations, can bid for hosting of one or more sports which they have more confidence in managing.\nIt could be a discipline popular in their own country or region, or a case of them having existing infrastructure that are well placed to host the events.\nGiven the global spread of Commonwealth countries, it should not be too difficult to find various hosts that can accommodate a schedule where the weather is conducive for competing.\nWhile the economic benefits are less for the individual hosts, so are the costs and risks.  With different events conducted simultaneously in different cities, the Games can be completed in a shorter period too than the typical 10 days or more presently.\nWhile it means sportsmen and sportswomen from different disciplines may be in separate parts of the world, it may allow greater interaction among the fewer numbers onsite at each host city. \nUltimately, this approach provides opportunities for more cities and countries to host events of the Commonwealth Games and encourage participation from those which have never done so.\nSome dilution of commercial sponsorship can be expected, but this may spur more attention on the sports themselves and enjoyment of simpler but more personal experiences of bringing people together.\nThere is no way for the Commonwealth Games to compete with the Olympics, or specialised sporting events like World Aquatics or the World Cup for football.\nPerhaps a paradigm shift to focus more on member participation and meaningful camaraderie will help it establish its own niche to remain relevant.\nHave views on this issue or a news topic you care about?

TODAY’s Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young Singapore residents who have chosen careers in manual trades and are thriving. \nHere, Mr Vigneshwaran Gunasegaran, 39, talks about his transition from an army regular to a career in the rail industry. The Institute of Technical Education graduate, who has spent 10 years with train operator SMRT, works the graveyard shift and oversees track access for engineers and technicians.\n\nI started my career as an army regular, serving as an infantry leader and then a trainer at the Specialist Cadet School.\nAfter a decade of service, I embarked on a transformative career shift from carrying rifles to holding a portable radio to manage MRT track access with train operator SMRT.\nDuring my army days, I had fond memories of the years when I took the first train in the morning from Paya Lebar to Joo Koon station to report for duty at Pasir Laba Camp.\nI have always been amazed by the punctuality of our trains and the smoothness of the rides captivated me, instilling a deep appreciation for the efficiency of the rail services. It was this admiration that spurred my decision to join the rail industry and contribute to its excellence.\nMarch 10, 2024 marked a significant milestone as I celebrated my 10th anniversary at SMRT Trains.\nI started out as a technical officer in a team overseeing re-signalling work and my duties included testing communications-based train control.  \nIn 2018, I switched to a new role to become a ground controller.\nThis involved coordinating track access at a specific interchange station along the North-South East-West Line.\nContinuing my journey of professional growth, I moved the following year to work in the Operation Control Centre, where I currently serve as a track access controller.\nIn this role, I am tasked with controlling and authorising track access of all stations on the North-South East-West Line and ensuring adherence to safety protocols when SMRT engineers and technicians carry out their daily maintenance on the tracks, which is in the middle of the night when the trains are not running. \nI monitor track access by using the company’s Track Access Management System which gives me a clear overview of my colleagues on the tracks as well as their movements, so that I can ensure that these abide by safety protocols.\nBefore track access is given at any point, I have to go through various levels of checks with my colleagues in the Operations Control Centre to ensure that traction power is off, safety protection arrangements are in place and engineering trains stabled at worksite.\nOtherwise, this would mean that my colleagues could be exposed to a risk of electrocution at the trackside and be seriously injured.\nMy highest education qualification is a National ITE Certification in Electronics Engineering (Computer Technology) from the Institute of Technical Education but I hope to be able to pursue a diploma related to rail engineering through a SMRT’s educational advancement programme in the near future.\nBalancing the demands of night shifts with familial responsibilities has been challenging but fulfilling.  Since my job requires me to work from about 9pm to 6am in the morning, I plan my schedule well in order to manage my work and spend time with family and friends.\nIt was initially not easy as my children were young when I first joined SMRT, but with proper time management, I was able to juggle both my work and family responsibilities. I’m lucky that my family and friends see my passion and commitment towards work and support me wholeheartedly. \nAs I work at night, I must constantly be alert and attentive on duty as any delay in my response to any track-related issue could impact the safety and timeliness of our operations.\nAlthough my job may be considered a blue-collared one, I find it rewarding because I can see tangible results from my efforts.\nFrom safeguarding colleagues on the tracks to ensuring seamless journeys for commuters, each day presents an opportunity to make a meaningful difference.\nLooking back at my journey in SMRT, I am constantly reminded of the profound impact our work has on the community.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER:\nVigneshwaran Gunasegaran was an army regular for 10 years before he joined SMRT, where he is now a track access controller. Married with two children, his hobbies are bowling and badminton."

TODAY’s Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young Singapore residents who have chosen careers in manual trades and are thriving. \n\nHere, Mr Noel Ng, 31, recounts his decision to study hairdressing at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) and his journey towards becoming a salon owner managing a team of 24 stylists.\n \nIt has been 16 years since I first picked up a pair of hair scissors, and I’ve not looked back since.\nIn secondary school, I wasn’t motivated in my studies and struggled to pass my exams.\nMy best subject was Design & Technology. This made me consider doing something that was skills-based at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE), instead of continuing with my O-Levels.\nA new hairdressing course at ITE College East caught my eye.\nAt first, my parents were sceptical when I told them of my choice. They felt hairdressing was not a reputable industry and were worried for me.\nI explained to them the possibilities if I became a successful hairstylist, and they relented.\nHaving seen how far I’ve come, I think they are relieved that I’m doing well.\nI started my Nitec in Hair Fashion and Design in 2008.\nIt was tough at first — cutting hair is not as easy as it seems! My lecturers kept lessons enjoyable though. \nThe facilities at ITE — including a fully-equipped salon where we could learn everything from hair styling to colouring — also helped keep me motivated, as did the support I got.\nBack then, I practised on my family and friends — cutting their hair along a HDB corridor, with perspiration and hair all over my face. I supposed they liked it since they came back for more. That gave me more confidence to pursue my “art”.\nIn 2010, I was selected to be part of Team Singapore at the 8th WorldSkills Asean in Bangkok and pit my hairdressing skills against other youths in the region. I had to train intensively before that, and I’m proud that it paid off — I earned a Gold medal.\nIn 2011, I travelled to London for the WorldSkills’ international leg. This meant competing with the top-performing youths of each participating country. It was an eye-opening experience being able to represent Singapore on the global stage. I was glad to bring home a Medallion for Excellence.\nI completed my first Nitec in 2010, and graduated with my second in hair and scalp therapy in 2012. \nMy first job was a hair assistant. I was later promoted to stylist and moved around a few salons over the next few years. However, it was always my dream to open my own salon.\nIn 2016, that dream finally came true. With some savings, and plenty of support from my family, I opened Harts Salon in Bugis.\nAs a salon owner, I have a lot more responsibilities. I have to provide for my team, get customers in, manage people, and generally make sure things run smoothly.\nTo attract customers, I turned to social media marketing, showcasing our services and whatever was trending in the industry.\nThe effort paid off and soon, I was getting back-to-back appointments.\nBefore I expanded, I was attending to three to seven customers a day. It was a challenge to meet their expectations and I did worry at times that they would not like what I have done for them.\nThese days, my challenge lies more with managing and training my team of stylists. I started out with a team of four and I’ve steadily expanded it to 24 across three salons.\nWith a large team like this, it’s not easy paying attention to the individual stylist’s performance, but I try my best.\nI’m still growing and seeking out new ideas so I can stay ahead in the industry, for example by keeping in touch with the latest hairstyle trends.\nOperations-wise, I make sure there is transparency, and emphasise the need for good customer service among my team.\nAs an ITE graduate, I’m committed to nurturing talent and providing opportunities for fellow alumni in the industry. For example, before Covid-19 hit I was going back to ITE on an ad-hoc basis to share my experience with students. \nI have also hired some ITE grads at my salon, and I'm proud that a few of them have advanced to higher positions elsewhere! \nFor those looking to join the industry, you must enjoy hairdressing. When you start out, you are at the bottom rung but with perseverance and determination, you can be successful.\nABOUT THE WRITER:\nNoel Ng, 31, is the owner of Harts Salon located in Bugis. He also co-owns Hint Salon at Tanjong Pagar and Hei Ardour at Orchard Road. He believes that a good hairstylist is like a surgeon operating on hair — and can earn just as much as one. Outside of work, his favourite pastime is searching for good food.\nIf you have an experience to share or know someone who wishes to contribute to this series, write to voices@mediacorp.com.sg with your full name, address and phone number."

This came as a shock to me as I had been in a senior leadership role for nearly three years and had brought in significant revenue for my employer — a global company in the creative industry.\nI was informed that the reason for my retrenchment was “financial challenges” and it was not a “reflection of my past performance or contributions”.\nI asked about severance benefits, and was told I would not be getting any because the company was “not in a financially healthy position”.\nI have appealed for a payout in line with the Ministry of Manpower (MOM)’s recommendations — generally up to a months’ salary per year of service for employees who have served for at least two years — and am still waiting for a response. \nRetrenchment benefits are not enshrined in Singapore’s labour laws.\nAs mentioned, MOM gives only broad guidelines. Any severance amount depends on what is provided for in one’s employment contract, or paid out of good will — not because of legislation.\nSadly, my contract didn’t include any such provision.\nA friend urged me to speak with the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management who referred me to the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices.\nBoth officers who spoke with me were sympathetic but ultimately said the same thing my company’s Human Resources told me — that they can only point my company to best practices — and could not enforce anything.\nMy story isn’t the only one.\nThe recent high-profile retrenchments at Lazada and Google have exposed a weakness in Singapore’s labour laws, which experts acknowledge are geared towards supporting companies.\nIn the case of Google, affected staff were luckily offered a package that was “comparable” to retrenchment benefits in the United States.\nIn Lazada’s case, employees were offered two weeks’ salary per year of service. The Food Drinks and Allied Workers Union, which represents its workers, is pushing for more.\nFor perspective, I’ve worked as a Singaporean in Britain and Australia. Both these countries do have workplace laws that protect employees in the event of retrenchment.\nIn Australia for example, if you are made redundant, there is provision of at least four weeks’ pay if you have worked with a company for at least a year.\nIn Britain, employees get a payout if they’ve been working for a company for two years or more. This ranges from half a week’s pay to one-and-a-half week’s pay per full year of work, depending on age.\nThese practices give employees a safety net so that they can continue meeting financial obligations while searching for new jobs.\nAs a country that has ambitions to be a regional business hub, I urge MOM to strengthen the legal protection for employees here.  \nIf we are unable to strike a fair balance in the employment relationship, I worry about how competitive we will be in attracting and retaining global talents.\nHave views on this issue or a news topic you care about?

            "Article Body": "Singaporeans are increasingly seeking out meaningful, skilled labour, amid a growing push for better recognition and pay for such professions. TODAY’s Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young Singapore residents who have chosen careers in manual trades and are thriving. \nHere, Mr Ho Boon Ping, 34, who started an air-con servicing business in 2019, recounts the highs and lows of his journey. After seeing how blue-collar roles are in demand overseas, he says that they deserve the same recognition in Singapore.\n \nWhen I was young, I thought studies were not important and neglected them. Not surprisingly, my N-Level results were not great.\nWhile browsing through the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) website for courses I could apply for, it occurred to me that with Singapore being such a hot and humid country, we can’t live without air-conditioning.\nSo I opted for a Nitec in Facility Technology (Air-Conditioning & Refrigeration), which I started in April 2010. \nDuring the course, I went on an exchange programme at Box Hill Institute in Melbourne, Australia, where I saw women and many locals in blue-collar jobs.\nI was even more surprised to hear that plumbers, electricians, and HVAC (heating, ventilation and air-conditioning) technicians were in demand in Australia.\nIt made me hope that such jobs can achieve the same level of recognition in Singapore. \nIn May 2013, I started working for Stulz (Singapore) — a German air-conditioning services firm — as a service engineer.\nDuring my interview, I frankly told the hiring manager that I did not have much experience. He was more than willing to train me, so I got the job. \nThere, I learnt a lot about computer room air-conditioning and how temperature, humidity and airflow can affect machine performance. \nStulz also sent me to Hamburg, Germany, for a week of training at its headquarters.\nIt was an eye-opening experience. There, I also noticed that many of their technicians are locals as well.\nI stayed on with Stulz for six years, during which I also completed a part-time Higher Nitec in Marine and Offshore Technology as well as a part-time diploma in Building Services and Fire Safety from Ngee Ann Polytechnic. \nIn 2018, my sister was hospitalised for eight weeks due to a lung infection. She couldn’t work after that and had to depend on the family.\nThat was when I started thinking about leaving my comfort zone to help take care of my sister.\nI didn’t plan much — I resigned in May 2019 to look after her and rest. It was then that I decided to set up my own business as I love hands-on work and going to different job locations. \nIn December 2019, I started Comfort Cooling Services, which provides air-conditioning and repair services.\nUnfortunately, Covid-19 struck just two months later. During the lockdown, I did some freelance work in building and servicing to get by. \nFrom there, I slowly built my customer base. I had zero connections so it wasn’t until mid-2021 that I started getting regular clients.\nI know many people are sceptical when engaging contractors to service their air-conditioners. I told myself I had to build up a business that provides honest and quality service. \nMy ITE lecturers taught me good installation work, and I used that to guide me while building my business. \nWhen my customers engage my services, I won’t push unnecessary add-ons such as topping up refrigerant gas annually. \nThis is a common contractor suggestion that is not necessary as long as the air-conditioner is installed properly and working fine. \nA typical day will see me servicing air-conditioners at different locations and sometimes meeting new customers, who get to know of me through word-of-mouth.\nIt’s very satisfying for me as I feel that I learn something new every day, even though I have been doing this for a while.\nMy biggest challenge is having to get over my fear of heights, especially when I have  customers in older Housing and Development Board flats with no air-conditioner ledge.\nI have to use a safety harness to climb out of the flat to check or top up the refrigerant.\nIt gives me great satisfaction when my customers give me good feedback on my work, and when I manage to solve their air-conditioning problems.\nTo me, machines can’t do a hands-on job like mine. You need to be able to think on your feet. I feel that there will be great demand for skilled workers (plumbers, electricians, HVAC technicians and so on), especially when fewer people are taking up such jobs.\nFor those thinking of going into this line, have faith in your skill and do what you are happy with.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER:\nHo Boon Ping, 34, runs his own business — Comfort Cooling Services — and provides air-conditioning and handyman services such as plumbing, replacing of taps, water tank accessories, and electrical switches.\nIf you have an experience to share or know someone who wishes to contribute to this series, write to voices@mediacorp.com.sg with your full name, address and phone number."

            "Article Body": "Given how costly it is to undergo driving lessons and tests and how relatively affordable our public transport system, this TODAY journalist had never seriously considered getting a driving licence — but recent events have prompted a change of heart, even if he still doesn’t plan to own a car.\nWhenever the subject of cars comes up in conversations with friends, the same thought always comes to my mind: Is it really necessary to be able to drive in Singapore?\nSingapore is well-known to have an efficient and world-class public transportation system. Having spent my entire life relying on trains and buses to get around, I’ve always wondered why so many people complain about how expensive it is to own a car here, but yet still choose to spend thousands of dollars to earn a driving licence when they may never own a car.\nGiven how costly it is to undergo driving lessons and tests and how relatively affordable our public transport system is, obtaining a driving licence had never really been something I seriously considered.\nHowever, recent events have prompted me to have a change of heart — even if I don’t plan to own a car.\nBelieve it or not, even on a tiny island like Singapore, some places remain relatively inaccessible for public transport users. \nI vividly recall an instance where I had to attend a social gathering event after work at a certain government building at Mount Pleasant. \nAt first glance, the usually reliable Google Maps told me that it was only less than 10 minutes’ walk from the nearest bus stop. \nTo my horror, the walk led me through an unforgiving uphill slog. It seemed never-ending, especially after spending more than eight hours in the office hunched over a desk. \nJust a few minutes into this trek, my laptop that I carried in my bag started to feel like it was made of solid rock. \nBy the time I arrived at my destination, I was drenched in sweat. My thighs were aching for days after. \nMount “Pleasant”? As if.\nHilly mini-route marches aside, even a leisurely visit to some of my favourite downtime destinations these days is still not easy or convenient. \nEast Coast Park is one example, as there are no straightforward ways of getting there using public transport, especially on weekdays.\nSure, you can always get anywhere by hopping into a cab or pulling up a ride-hailing app on your phone. \nBut it’s likely fair to say we all have our own nightmare experiences with surge pricing and difficult drivers who refuse to go the extra mile when asked nicely, or even cancel booked rides for no rhyme or reason. \nCars bearing car-sharing brand logos are becoming more common a sight on our roads as well as in my own neighbourhood.\nEven though I can’t use car-sharing, their prevalence has led me to do my own research into why more Singaporeans are turning to them.\nFlexibility is one key pull factor for me — being able to use the services just for a short trip to a friend’s house at another ulu place or a full day spent running various errands.\nAffordability is another. Since I would not be a regular road user, the overall cost of renting a car, as opposed to owning one, would be more in my favour. I wouldn’t need to bear costs for maintenance, insurance, taxes and so on.\nFinally, there’s convenience. \nMost car-sharing services are accessible through mobile apps — a plus for me, as I already rely upon smartphone apps for most of my daily routine tasks, from setting my alarm, paying for meals and other purchases, to even grocery shopping.\nMuch like any young Singaporean, I love travelling once in a while to get away from the bustling cityscape.\nI’ve been fortunate enough to witness the breathtaking landscapes of Iceland and Arizona in the United States, among other memorable trips.\nOne thing I’ve never been able to do is a road trip, driving for days on open roads through beautiful natural landscapes with incredible sceneries round every corner.\nA destination high up on my road-tripping bucket list would be New Zealand. For me, it's just second to Iceland, which I had been to on an organised tour group that did not feel as satisfying as I'd anticipated.\nI’ll admit: Listening to road trip stories of friends and watching travel videos on social media, the Fomo is starting to set in. \nPerhaps some places are much better off explored on the road by driving, instead of in a tour bus filled with 20 others.\nWhen getting around different places in groups with family and friends, carpooling has been my go-to option most of the time. \nHowever, during Hari Raya visitations this year, I noticed the exhaustion setting in on the faces of the full-day drivers tasked with commuting the same group of people from one house to another — a total of seven destinations over at least five hours. \nWatching them fight off yawn after yawn, I felt a pang of guilt. \nI wondered: “Would it be better if I gave them a break and took over the wheel for a bit?”\nWhile it’s true that situations like these do not occur too often, as I get older, I’m starting to think that it would be nice if I could, once in a while, offer some help with ferrying my relatives around for family events.\nHaving tied the knot not too long ago, images of a possible future with kids in it have started flashing in my head. \nHow would I get a toddler to daycare, and pick him up at the end of the day? Would I want to have my (potentially rowdy) kids running around on a crowded train or bus? \nIf my family were indeed to get bigger, other necessities will also come into play — larger grocery loads, additional furniture, and more. Perhaps in this possible future, the increased practicality and convenience of private modes of transport would be well worth the additional monetary costs.\nAll this considered, it might just be time to step out of my comfort zone at last, and into the driver’s seat.\nHere's hoping the numerous driving lessons that will be occupying my schedule for the next few months will be a good investment of my time and, more importantly, my money.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nSufiyan Samsuri is a journalist at TODAY."

            "Article Body": "Online content on love and relationships such as the \"orange peel theory\" can be fun, but if you find yourself routinely turning to social media fads as a real-world litmus test for your partner, perhaps it’s a sign to hit pause and reflect, says this communications strategist.\nJust a few months ago, women took to TikTok in droves to share videos of themselves testing their partners’ love by asking them to peel an orange. \nIt was funny to watch this fad play out — Singaporeans even put their own spin on it by asking their partners to peel prawns instead. But it also makes one wonder how much weight we're putting on these touted ideals when we put our phones down.\nHaving grown up in the digital age, I've always been drawn to social media for guidance on everything from career to food, and relationships. With just a tap or scroll, we can easily access bite-sized advice tailored to our specific concerns. \nIn a world where time is of the essence and instant gratification is the norm, the quick fixes offered online are very appealing to modern young adults dealing with relationship dilemmas. \nBut I’ve begun to notice how toxic Internet dating content can seep into our real lives, subtly perpetuating harmful stereotypes and eroding the foundation of healthy relationships. \nFor women, such advice often trends towards glorifying jealousy, fixating on superficial signs like texting habits, and equating love with material wealth. \nOn the flip side, men are fed toxic messaging that discourages vulnerability, pressures them to become dominant “alpha males”, and promotes manipulative tactics like delaying responses to texts. \nTake, for instance, the catchy mantra-turned-meme: \"If he wanted to, he would.\" It seems simple — if your partner cared about you, he would act accordingly. \nBut people aren’t that simple. There are dangers that come with attempting to streamline the complexities of human emotions and motivations into a binary equation such as this.\nFood-related challenges, such as the quirky “orange peel theory” and the more recent “ketchup challenge” — which entails cleaning up spilled ketchup on camera — are designed to test a partner's devotion through trivial tasks. \nBut can we really judge the strength of our relationships based on such arbitrary acts? \nCreating unnecessary scenarios just to put our partners on display for public scrutiny and judgement is not only dehumanising but also undermines the trust and respect essential for healthy connection and intimacy. \nIt doesn’t help that many young adults are already under implicit pressure to measure the success of many aspects of their lives against what they see on social media. \nThe tendency to compare oneself to others is natural — however, social media amplifies the negative impacts of such comparison, especially among youths who spend a lot of time scrolling through peers' profiles. \nFor young people, repeated exposure to idealised portrayals of love and dating online can create feelings of inadequacy or insecurity, leading to discontent or disappointment in their own relationships. \nSome of my own friends have gotten caught up in replicating “relationship milestones” to the point where it became all about ticking off certain boxes: Posting perfect couple photos, marking anniversaries in unique, flashy ways, or staging elaborate displays of affection. \nIn chasing these external validations, we risk losing sight of what truly matters: The genuine emotional connection and compatibility we share with our partners.\nPopular social media platforms such as TikTok and Instagram run on algorithms that favour viral content. Trends that promote sensationalised or exaggerated relationship advice often pick up steam quickly and easily, quickly racking up millions of views.\nBut such content often lacks the depth needed to navigate the subjective nature of human relationships.\nSnappy catch phrases do well with gaining traction on social media, but don't consider personal struggles, communication barriers, geographical locations, or the fact that everyone expresses love differently. \nPerhaps it’s more useful to view catchy phrases and advice soundbites as food for thought.\nFor example, while TikTok videos of users testing out the orange peel theory saw millions of viewers tuning in, the theory’s popularity seemed to be overwhelmingly limited to girls and women — a group that is typically taught from a young age to prioritise and anticipate others' needs without complaint or concern for our own. \nCould it be that a seemingly arbitrary request of peeling an orange isn’t showing us if our partner loves us or not, but rather reflecting our own desire for our unvoiced needs to be met?\nIn the midst of the noise, how do we discern what's helpful from what's harmful? Here are some tips that I rely on.\nFirstly, exercise critical thinking. \nConsider the content's tone and approach: Who are they speaking to — a generalised group of people, or a specific type of individual in a specific type of situation? Are they promoting healthy communication and mutual understanding, or do they rely on popular but trite wisdom, or deceptively simple solutions? \nLook for sources backed by professionals, such as licensed therapists, or relationship experts with verifiable credentials.\nI've personally found a couple of accounts that I really resonate with, like @thesecurerelationship and @your.being. They're run by certified psychologists and relationship experts who offer genuine, evidence-based advice. \nLastly, never underestimate the power of open communication and mutual understanding in relationships. \nRegardless of what strangers are saying, the voice that matters most is that of yours and your partner's. Approach conversations with honesty, vulnerability, and a willingness to listen. \nIn the real world, a relationship between two persons demands open communication and mutual understanding, not snap assumptions based solely on actions prescribed by strangers or digital trends. \nLet's leave the oranges and ketchup in the kitchen, and focus on the real, authentic moments that can strengthen our bonds in a healthy way.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nNicole Chan is a communications strategist by trade, and a digital native by passion.

            "Article Body": "\"Being an introvert, I could never bring myself to approach a stranger and engage in small talk. It felt unnatural and fake,\" writes the author, a UX designer. Here's how she managed to make networking less nerve-wracking for herself.\n \nHave you turned down invitations to networking events? Or attended a conference only to leave immediately after the scheduled speakers wrap up on stage, so that you can avoid the post-programme mingling?\nI have. \nBeing an introvert, networking made me cringe and my stomach churn. It made me want to turn and flee — and I often did.\nFor the first 15 years of my professional life, I avoided networking like the plague. \nOn the few occasions I absolutely had to attend a conference or an industry event, I mostly stood around awkwardly, watching some people breeze into the crowded room and effortlessly strike up a conversation with others like long-lost friends. \nI could never bring myself to approach a stranger — or worse, a group of strangers — and engage in small talk. It felt unnatural and “fake”. \nOver time, I convinced myself that networking just wasn't my cup of tea.\nTwo years ago, I embarked on a big career transition from procurement to user experience (UX) design. To improve at a faster rate, I wanted to meet more UX designers to learn about their experience and to seek feedback on my portfolio. \nFor once, I felt the push to reach out to others in the industry. I knew I had to do something to overcome my discomfort with networking.\nSo, for the first time in my life, I attended a networking event entirely out of my own volition. \nAnd I did it alone.\nMy heart was pounding fearfully as I stood by myself and scanned the crowd for a friendly face. \nI eventually mustered the courage to approach someone — a small business owner pivoting into UX design.\nWe ended up having a great conversation about our respective career transition experiences. \nIt turned out that she was also a user of my agency’s digital platform, so as a bonus, I managed to get some customer insights too.\nAfter crossing that first hurdle, I felt more at ease and confident, and it became easier to initiate conversations with the others at the event. \nAt the end of the day, I left the event happy, with a whole slate of new connections.\nThat day brought me to a realisation: By reframing how I felt about networking, I was able to let go of my self-doubt and insecurities.  \nInstead, I now see networking as just another skill that we can practise and get better at — just like learning a new sport or a new language.\nI also see how valuable networking can be. It can help you to open new doors, learn something new, or just to make new friends.\nTruthfully, I still feel awkward at the start of each event — but by the end, I always have something valuable to take away with me when I leave. \nHere are some tips I picked up over time to make networking less nerve-wracking for me.\n#1: Know your ‘why’\nTo reduce your social anxiety, go in with a broader objective than purely to “network”. \nAsk yourself: Why are you attending this event in the first place? Take the pressure off yourself by redirecting the focus to other people or things.\nFor example, I attend events that focus on key topics or feature speakers that I’m already interested in. When I’m going to an event with the purpose of learning something, the “networking” part becomes less of a sticking point in my head. \n#2: Start with small goals \nAre you networking in a bid to score a job referral, or to make 10 new connections? \nIf lofty goals such as these seem overwhelming to you, you can always start small. Aiming to make just one new connection can be enough. \n#3: Make genuine connections \nNetworking can often feel “fake”. It can feel like you’re going around trying to promote yourself to people you don’t know — and that can be extremely uncomfortable for introverts like me. \nIt doesn’t have to be this way. \nIntroverts often excel in active listening, and they thrive in intimate, small settings. Use that strength to your advantage, and seek to make genuine connections. \nFor my part, I strive to approach new connections with a curious mindset: With each new person I meet, I aim to learn at least one interesting thing about them. This makes the engagement meaningful and reduces the discomfort about making “small talk” with strangers for no real reason. \n#4: Prepare and practise \nStarting conversations can be daunting for many introverts.\nOne reason for my anxiety was that I was just not prepared enough. I never thought about how I was going to introduce myself, what questions I would ask, and how I would exit the conversation. \nPreparing and practising beforehand can give you that extra boost of confidence. \nOver time, it will become more natural and you will find that you don't need so much practice before the event. \n#5: Go alone\nThis may seem counterintuitive. After all, you’re already anxious about networking. Shouldn’t you attend such an event with a friend or someone familiar for support? \nHear me out. \nIn my experience, whenever I go to an event with a friend — especially another introvert — chances are the two of us will end up spending the entire time engaged in conversation with each other. We miss out on opportunities to connect with other people. \nGoing alone pushes me out of my comfort zone, so that I have more reason to take the first step to interact with someone new.\nLet’s say you went out on a limb and attended a networking event alone, doing your best to employ the tips and tricks above. It’s possible that you may still fail to meet anyone new. \nIf you didn’t manage to make any new connections, or if you didn’t even make it to the mingling portion of the event (like I struggled to before), don’t be too hard on yourself. \nIt’s not the end. There’s always another opportunity. \nLike with learning any new skill, what’s more important is that after each attempt, you reflect on what went well and how you can do better. \nIf you did manage to meet new people, give yourself a pat on the back. Note down what you did to help you achieve that, and think about how you can repeat it or improve further upon it the next time round. \nAs with any skill, the only way to get better and strengthen our confidence is to allow ourselves to practise and learn from our own mistakes. \nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nFiona Lee is a former procurement professional turned UX designer in the public sector. She now crafts digital experiences for individuals and businesses."

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "As artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI continue to rapidly evolve and reshape our lives, safeguarding our children has never been more critical. \nEarlier this year, the chief executives of five major social media companies testified in a US Senate hearing on Big Tech and the online child sexual exploitation crisis, sparking a heated debate on child online safety and mental health. \nCurrently, researchers vary in their views on the effects of technology use on children's well-being. That said, what we do know is that social media use and mental health problems in youths have increased in tandem; more and more studies are finding links between the two in several contexts. \nWhat all experts seem to agree on is that tech industries and governments alike need to work to create better online environments for our children. \nIn the midst of all this, the integration of AI into various digital platforms and services has introduced new complexities to the online safety landscape. \nAs parents, guardians, and caregivers, we need to understand both the potential benefits and risks associated with AI and equip ourselves with the knowledge and tools needed to navigate these complexities effectively.\nHere are some ways in which AI complicates things:\nEnhanced personalisation: AI algorithms used by popular streaming platforms analyse user data to recommend content tailored to individual preferences, potentially exposing children to inappropriate material beyond parental control.\nDeepfakes and manipulated content: AI enables the creation of hyper-realistic deepfake videos. This allows malicious actors to fabricate content that can deceive and harm children, such as fake celebrity endorsements of dangerous or illicit materials or altered news clips spreading wrong or misleading information.\nAlgorithmic bias: Social media platforms employ AI algorithms that may inadvertently amplify biases against certain demographics, resulting in discriminatory content distribution and fostering negative perceptions among children based on factors like ethnicity, gender, or socio-economic status.\nPrivacy concerns: AI-driven smart toys and devices, such as smart speakers and interactive dolls, often collect and store children's personal data without robust privacy protections, raising concerns about unauthorised access, data breaches, and potential exploitation by third parties for targeted advertising or identity theft.\nWhile AI introduces new challenges to online safety, it is also a promising tool in bolstering online safety measures with its advanced algorithms that can swiftly analyse vast amounts of data, allowing for the rapid identification and mitigation of potential threats and harmful content. \nHere's how AI can be leveraged to enhance online safety for children:\nContent moderation: Platforms like TikTok and Instagram use AI algorithms to automatically flag and remove inappropriate content, such as violent or explicit videos in violation of their community standards, ensuring a safer browsing experience for young users.\nAdaptive parental controls: Apps like Google Family Link and Apple Screen Time employ AI algorithms to analyse children's online activities and adjust parental controls accordingly, allowing parents to set limits on specific apps, websites, or screen time based on their child's age and behaviour.\nCybersecurity solutions: AI-driven cybersecurity software like CrowdStrike and Halcyon  utilise machine learning algorithms and generative AI to detect and block online threats, such as viruses, malware, and phishing attempts, protecting children's devices and personal information from cyberattacks.\nDigital well-being features: Platforms like Apple iOS and Android devices offer digital well-being features powered by AI algorithms that monitor screen time, track app usage, and provide insights into device usage patterns, helping parents and children maintain a healthy balance between online and offline activities.\nWhile AI-driven solutions and regulations can contribute to maintaining online safety, parents and caregivers also need to get closely involved. Here are practical recommendations on how to further enhance your children's online safety:\nEstablish open communication: A recent survey by the Ministry of Communications and Information highlighted that parents are not always aware of children’s online gaming activities. It's essential to establish a supportive and open dialogue with your children about their online experiences. Continually encourage them to share what they enjoy about these activities and to ask questions where they’re unsure, fostering an environment where they feel comfortable discussing any concerns or incidents they may encounter. \nPrioritise digital literacy for the whole family: Digital literacy impacts the necessary skills needed to thrive alongside AI and to be resilient both online and offline. Begin by educating yourself about various aspects of technology, including AI, and best online safety practices. By teaching family members, especially children, about responsible online behaviour — such as respecting others’ privacy and protecting their own, avoiding cyberbullying, and critically evaluating information — they can navigate the online world responsibly and identify potential risks and threats.\nCo-create rules around usage: Nurture a collaborative approach within your family to co-create boundaries and rules regarding screen time, appropriate content consumption, and online interactions. Rely on expert guidance to create these rules and regularly review and adjust these guidelines as needed to ensure they remain relevant and effective in promoting a healthy and balanced digital lifestyle for everyone. \nLead by example: There is mounting evidence that how parents use digital media can have a big impact on their children’s development. Be mindful of your own online behaviours and habits, as children often model their behaviour based on their parents'. Set a positive example as a technology role model by promoting quality tech use for your children. This can involve dedicating phone-free time each day to do activities with your child or choosing online activities together that are educational and enriching, like playing games, exploring videos and tutorials on hobbies such as painting, crafts, gardening etc.  \nStay informed and engaged: Engage with your children's digital experiences to understand their behaviour, enabling you to monitor any sudden and unexpected changes in mood and well-being. Rather than avoiding new technologies like AI out of fear, it’s important to stay updated on the latest trends and developments, so you can both appreciate their vast possibilities while maintaining safety for you and your kids in this new digital age.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nDr Gayathri Haridas is a policy manager at public policy consultancy Access Partnership where her work focuses on the impact of digital technologies on society.

            "Article Body": "The author, who suffers from spinal muscular atrophy, says new drugs could greatly improve his quality of life. Even so, he’s in no hurry to take costly medications to which continued, consistent access cannot be guaranteed due to the exorbitant price tag.\nAt this year’s Committee of Supply debate, Nominated Member of Parliament Ong Hua Han asked the Ministry of Health (MOH) to consider extending financial help for patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) to access disease-modifying treatments. Such treatments improve patients’ quality of life, but are not full-fledged cures.\nHe cited a crowdfunding campaign by Singaporean games journalist Sherry Toh, who is trying to raise S$375,000 for a one-year supply of the drug Evrysdi (risdiplam), an oral medication to be taken daily. Evrysdi is the only treatment option registered with and approved by our Health Sciences Authority.\nAnother treatment, Zolgensma, is a one-time gene therapy, but must be administered before a child turns two years old. It costs upwards of S$2 million. \nChildren in Singapore have access to Zolgensma on a compassionate use basis. A few have managed to benefit from this drug, following successful crowdfunding campaigns to raise the millions of dollars needed.\nSMA, which I am also affected by, is a congenital neuromuscular disorder in which the nerve cells that carry messages from the brain to the rest of the body weaken and die, causing progressive muscle weakness. \nMost patients are unable to stand or sit unsupported. As the disease worsens, problems with swallowing, speaking, and breathing occur.\nSMA is a rare disease — according to a 2023 MOH statement, there are only about 40 to 50 patients in Singapore. It is also terminal.\nI’ve never been one to sugarcoat or romanticise my condition. The fact is: It sucks. \nI can’t do many things most people would consider routine, like moving around independently or eating delicious food. Even the simple things that I can do for myself take huge reserves of energy, and I find myself tired and in discomfort all the time.\nBecause of SMA, I will never experience many wonderful facets of life: A rollercoaster ride; a night out drinking at the bar; having a kid and teaching him to play football.\nWith the advent of disease-modifying treatments (DMTs), especially when administered to a young child who is still in the early stages of the disease, these things are no longer a pipe dream.\nChildren in the United States who were given Zolgensma as newborns several years ago are now running around schoolyards with their friends — something that would have been unfathomable a decade ago.\nCloser to home, Ms Toh noted on her campaign page that her ability to swallow water improved after she received a complimentary three-month supply of Evrysdi on a compassionate basis from manufacturer Roche. \nBefore, she would have taken about 52 seconds to drink a given amount of water. After starting on the drug, her time decreased to 16 seconds. \nDMTs have changed the SMA landscape forever. But every discussion on DMTs in Singapore runs into the same issue: Cost.\nIn the US, insurance covers the cost of DMTs and allows ready access to those who need it. \nHere in Singapore, though, patients have no option at the moment but to figure out a way to pay the exorbitant price tag on their own.\nHere are my rough calculations: If I want to get treated with Evrysdi, I would have to work my white-collar office job for more than five years to save up enough for a single year of treatment.\nThis is why I’m ambivalent about even starting on the drug, which relies on taking consistent doses in order to sustain its effects.\nWhat happens if I no longer have access to this costly drug? The joys and freedoms, and the improvements to my quality of life it would bring — all those positive effects would go away in an instant.\nIt seems really cruel to put myself through that. And so, I’d rather not commit to the treatment while financial cost is still the biggest stumbling block to my continued access to it.\nI don’t enjoy having SMA — but after 26 years, I’ve come to terms with it. I’ve become used to living my life while working around the ever-increasing limitations my disease places on me.\nI’m in no hurry to plunge myself into a situation where I have to constantly worry about running out of money to buy medicine, or be subject to the trauma of finding myself robbed of my newfound strength and independence all over again.\nDon’t get me wrong: I’m not saying I don’t want medicine that could better my life.\nIf our health insurance system suddenly became like the US’s overnight, and I could access Evrysdi with little worry about the price, I would take it in a heartbeat.\nBut the reality is that our system is set up completely differently. It’s not my intention to “fix” our system with this piece — plenty of other highly qualified writers and experts have suggested solutions to the affordability problems facing rare disease treatment.\nFor example, the Rare Disease Fund (RDF) could potentially help SMA patients afford DMTs, if SMA gets added to the list of diseases it covers.\nBut even if so, the RDF has a very small quantity of funds available to it, and a growing quantity of demand on these funds. SMA is just one of a whole constellation of rare diseases out there, and treatments for all of them are just as expensive, if not more so.\nIt would of course be ideal to help every patient who needs support — but we don’t live in an ideal world. Funds are finite. There are only two options: Be selective in who gets help, or get more funds.\nGetting more funds is, in turn, a whole other can of worms because of opportunity cost. \nIf the government allocates more money to the RDF, that’s money taken away from some other use or need, like education or assisting the elderly or cushioning the impact of inflation on the lower income. \nAt the governmental level, I trust Singapore is doing the best it can for the RDF.\nThat brings us back to being selective in who gets help. \nUnfortunately, allocating resources is, by nature, a zero-sum game.\nLet me put it this way: If the RDF has to choose between subsidising treatment for me or a young child also suffering from SMA, I’d rather medical help goes to the kid.\nStopping his SMA progression at a much earlier stage means he will retain more of his physical abilities and strength. \nHe will have his whole life ahead of him, giving him a much longer runway to do lots of amazing things that I can only dream of.\nWhile we figure out how to address the funding gap, one intermediate step I do wish for the authorities to consider is to make SMA testing more prevalent in Singapore.\nMany developed nations screen newborns for SMA through a simple blood test. According to Novartis, which developed Zolgensma, 45 per cent of babies in Europe are tested for SMA at birth. This compares to 44 per cent in Australia and an impressive 80 per cent in Taiwan.\nEarly detection of SMA is crucial in the age of DMTs because the sooner the patient begins treatment, the better the outcome in the long run.\nBesides rolling out more widespread newborn screening for SMA, I’d like Singapore to dream even bigger: Introduce routine carrier testing for the gene that causes SMA. This is also possible through a simple blood test.\nI understand from my relatives’ experiences with starting a family that, currently, couples are advised to get tested for the gene only if they have a family member with SMA like me.\nBut with one in 40 people carrying the SMA gene, there are actually many people out there who are blissfully unaware. All it takes is for two of them to procreate, and their child will have a 25 per cent chance of having SMA.\nI personally always encourage my newly married friends to ask for the test before having kids. \nIf couples are aware of their carrier status before they try for a baby, they will be in a better position to make an informed decision on whether to go ahead with reproductive efforts or consider alternatives such as adoption.\nUltimately, SMA is a devastating disease which incurs costs that go far beyond the financial. The physical and psychological toll it takes on patients and their families cannot be quantified.\nMaking any decisions regarding SMA — or any other rare disease for that matter — is a highly personal affair involving a complex interplay of each individual’s dreams, fears, beliefs, values, and life circumstances.\nThere are no easy or correct answers, but with the knowledge we have available to us at any given moment, we can make the decision that feels right for us, and then make the best of it.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nJonathan Tiong, 26, works in corporate communications and employee engagement.

            "Article Body": "Moving out as a young single is undoubtedly costly, but why do Singaporeans judge others for how they choose to manage their own money as well as their mental and emotional well-being? A TODAY deputy editor explores the question: What if it’s not really about numbers in bank accounts, but about our ideas of “failure”?\nFor young Singaporeans, the Covid-19 pandemic brought on several changes to life as we’d known it. Most learnt to adjust to remote work — some irrevocably so. Many picked up new hobbies and interests that pre-pandemic busyness had kept them from pursuing.\nAnd some realised that they just can’t live at home anymore. \nThis week, TODAY’s mental health series Gen Zen explored the difficult dilemmas young singles face in deciding whether or not to move out of their family homes due to strained relations. \nYouths and mental health experts weighed in on how living independently can affect one’s well-being in both positive and negative ways: No one to bug you with endless nagging and questions, thumbs up! No one to help you with housework and chores, thumbs down. \nGiven that young singles choosing to move out has long been a contentious topic in Singapore, perhaps it’s only natural that the column sparked a debate from readers and other members of the public.\nDespite the mental health benefits laid out by both this piece as well as many others already published on the subject in recent years, many felt that for young Singaporeans, the cons of moving out still far outweigh the pros.\nLet’s be real, these people said, there’s no way any amount of mental or emotional gain can make the financial cost of living independently worth it — especially as this cost continues to climb amid economic squeezes and pressures.\nEven if you manage to make enough to afford rent, said these dissenters, you may not actually be ridding yourself of the stresses that accompany living at home.\nThey pointed out that in your desperation to escape friction or tension with your family, you could end up saddled with bad housemates or, even worse, a “nightmare” landlord. Same problem, different roof.\nAll in all, this camp advised: Don’t make the mistake of giving up long-term financial gains for short-term peace of mind.\nEven so, many others stood by the intangible benefits of living away from one’s family.\nIt’s not only about getting away from unhealthy or toxic situations, many said, but to gain some healthy growth and independence that would better prepare and ease one into full adulthood.\nA few rebutted the potential problem of difficult roommates or landlords by highlighting that such situations are useful opportunities for acquiring and practising various skills required for living harmoniously with others — undoubtedly valuable knowledge for Singaporeans, given the way our country’s land constraints require most of us to live in close quarters. \nSome shared how moving out early had greased the wheels on their progression into living with their current partners or spouses.\nSeveral added that living away from one’s family also makes it easier to have a love life — an unquestionable boon for Singapore, surely, given youths’ rising rates of singlehood and the downward slide of our birth rate.\nMoving out is a big change for anyone at any stage of life. For this — and for any other major decision, really — the scale on which we balance the pros and cons aren’t weighted the same way for everyone. \nFor some, the benefits of moving out far outstrip the costs. For others, the price of freedom and independence will never be justified. \nEven so, why do we feel the need to judge others for how they choose to manage their own money, as well as their mental and emotional well-being?\nOne Reddit user, AivernT, put this forth as the underlying “crux” of the entire debate: “We are so conditioned to hyper-optimise our finances to hit every milestone that any deviation appears to be considered a failure.”\nFrom this perspective, what we’re really worried about isn’t numbers in bank accounts. It’s about how we internalise our fellow Singaporeans choosing to make what we personally perceive to be a mistake — choosing “failure”.\nBut why is this such a sensitive trigger for us?\nSingaporeans are well conditioned to avoid and guard against failure. As a small nation with grand ambitions and limited resources, we haven’t had much chance to enjoy a large margin for error, historically speaking. \nBut now, nearly six decades into independence, our countless achievements speak for themselves. Singapore’s rise-and-grind culture has also earned us a global reputation for unparalleled hustlerdom. \nPerhaps we’ve done more than enough to earn ourselves a little breathing room. Some space to take a step back instead of letting all that conditioning prod us into deploring each other’s individual decisions, even when we don’t personally agree with the logic behind each one.\nRetooling the overwhelming instinct to avoid failure at all costs starts with retooling our understanding of what “failure” even is. \nA couple of responses offered up a new lens through which to calculate the cost-benefit analysis of moving out: Improving one's mental health environment may be a boost to one’s ability to perform far better in the workplace — which, in turn, could drastically improve one’s financial prospects. \nTo one person, renting may be “throwing away money”. To another, it could be a crucial investment not only in their current well-being, but also their future growth. \nOf course, it’s still important to make wise decisions in life — keeping in mind that “wise” may look different for each one of us. \nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nMelissa Lee Suppiah is a deputy editor at TODAY where she oversees commentaries.

It is typically a treat at their favourite restaurant or gift of their choice.\nSo imagine one Malaysian student's surprise when he received not one, but two baller gifts for his good results.\n17-year-old Faris scored an impressive 6As in his SPM examinations, which is equivalent to the O-Levels in Singapore.\nThe Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) is a national exam that all fifth-form secondary school students in Malaysia have to sit for. The results were released on Monday (May 27).\nIn an Instagram video posted by Faris' mum, Malaysian entrepreneur and influencer Liana Rosli, she is seen presenting the excited teen the keys to his new ride, a grey Mercedes Benz, as well as a cheque of RM10K (S$2.8K). It is not mentioned if the car is brand new.\nFaris was shocked when he saw the figure on the cheque, to which his mum said: “It’s okay. Just take it.”\nThough Faris did not get straight As, Liana said the \"results were more than enough\" for her, and emphasised that his achievements were more significant than the gifts.\nFaris also shared the video on his socials, thanking his mum for being a constant pillar of support.\n“You were always there when I felt down and alone. Thank you for always praying for me,” he wrote.\n“My mum has given me everything and there is nothing I can do in return but make her smile,” Faris added.\nRecently, Liana also made the news after her house was broken into, losing around RM3.5mil (S$1mil) worth of jewellery and luxury items. Part of the loot was later recovered.\nLiana has since expressed a desire to relocate due to safety concerns.\nPhotos: lianarosli_official/Instagram, farisanakmama/Instagram"

Just take it from Chris.\n“5566 was so famous, we were all so jealous! You guys attended every charity event we held!” he exclaimed.\nA shy Tony then said: “Yes, it seems like we appeared at every important event at that time. We once held a fan meet at the Merlion, and to date, I believe we are the only ones who have done something like that. We performed at the area in front of the Merlion, and the fans queued way past the [Esplanade] bridge to get our autograph.”\n“It was really wild,” agreed Chris, who then asked: “How long was the group together before you guys decided to go solo?”\nTony explained: “We always had an arrangement where we would fly solo, but never disband. We would get together when there were jobs for us as 5566.”\nChris mentioned rumours of discord within the quartet, with reports claiming that the members didn’t get along.\nTony elaborated: \"Back then, we were only in our early 20s, and our boss planned everything for us. We were young, and worked towards a common goal. However, when you reach a certain age, there are things you want to do, and you start to realise the meaning of life. It really came down to our choices.\"\nHe then brought up former band mate, Sam Wang, who has sat out from the group’s activities since 2016. “I feel like that can also be attributed to choice. He felt like the things he wanted to do [were different] and he did not want to be with the rest of us anymore,” explained Tony.\nChris concurred: “You’ve all grown up, and it’s impossible that you guys still share the same dream. The things you want to do will change, and there’s no right or wrong to it.”\nWhen asked about the “low moments” in his career, Tony revealed: “It was when 5566 just ended (in 2008). During that time, all the jobs strangely stopped coming as well. I was left with a few ad hoc jobs.\"\nTony once said in an interview that he had used up all his savings in the three years after the group disbanded. His life hit another low following his much-publicised divorce with actress Angel Han in 2015.\nWhile he did not mention said difficulties during his conversation with Chris and Kym, Tony shared that it was only after he began hosting more shows that things started to get back on track.\nIn a behind-the-scenes interview, Tony revealed: “Many years ago, when we released our last album (in 2008), although we didn’t say we were disbanding, we had completely stopped our activities as a group.”\nThree of the group’s members —Tony, Zax Wang, and Jason Hsu — reunited in 2016 at the 51st Golden Bell Awards. They have since appeared as a trio on other programmes and held concerts in both Taipei and Singapore in 2019.\nTony continued: “It’s all thanks to our fans that we’ve been able to get together again, hold our concert, and record a new song. Plenty of time has passed but it feels like nothing much has changed.”\nPhotos: mewatch\nWatch the full episode of Dishing With Chris Lee on mewatch, or catch it below. "

Only then did Yao Yao retrieve her packages.\nThe actress has since issued an apology for her behaviour. \nYao Yao explained that due to her busy work schedule and frequent travels, she had \"neglected to handle [her] daily affairs properly\". \n\"But that's not an excuse and I have reflected on myself and will settle this as soon as possible,\" she assured.\nYao Yao then promised to be accountable for herself in future and would ask her family to assist in paying her maintenance fees promptly. \n\"I'm really sorry for causing trouble to neighbours and the building's management committee,\" she said.

I also spoke Mandarin for the series, which made it very comfortable for me,\" he said. \nIn case you're wondering what he meant by \"being himself\", Weiming, who suffers from diabetes, is also wheelchair-bound in real life after having his left leg amputated in 2022.  \nPost-amputation, Weiming starred in English drama 128 Circle as drinks stall uncle Larry. In the show, Weiming wore a prosthetic limb. \nThe actor, who rose to fame after playing Ah Cai in '80s Mediacorp drama Neighbours, was also asked how he feels about the new generation of actors these days. \n\"They're smooth like a pond loach,\" he said sternly. \nHe added that they deliver their lines very well, but \"lack emotion\" and \"have no cadences or inflections in their voices\". \nWeiming said their efficiency in delivering their lines means there are very few no good takes and so they can end work early. However, after decades in the business, he knows that's not how acting is supposed to be like.\n\"Back when I was acting in Neighbours, I thought shooting 10 scenes in a day was a piece of cake and that acting was so easy. Thankfully, there were seniors like Ke Sha Fei and Cai Ping Kai who reminded me to not be so 'smooth' when acting,\" he recalled. \n\"It's important to not stutter, but we need to know when to pause and add layers to our performance.\"\nWeiming went on to share that he was supposed to act in a movie a while back, but he turned it down because of the pay. He was offered $1000 a day for a role that has no lines.\n\"I remember a conversation I had with late local actor Wang Sha. Back then, he asked me how much I charge for my getai performances, and I said I would quote them $500 for hosting. [Wang Sha] sighed: 'Silly child, if you only ask for $500 now, it would be very difficult for you to raise your price in the future. Even those with conscience will only pay you a little more',\" recalled Weiming. \nIt's why Weiming has learnt to value himself more. \n\"Since they are willing to approach me, it means I still have value. I don't have a manager so I need to fight for myself to be treated reasonably,\" he said. \nThis is perhaps also why Weiming, who's divorced and has two kids — a 37-year-old daughter and a 17-year-old son with his ex-wife — doesn't want his son to step into showbiz, though he was once approached to star in a drama.\nAccording to the actor, he rejected the offer for his son as he didn't want his son to enter the industry at such a young age.\nWhen he was told that his son looks exactly like him, Weiming laughed: \"He really resembled me when he was in secondary one or two. But now he's so fat, he's 100kg!\"\n\"If he stands in front of me, he can block me completely. I beg him to lose weight and exercise more! How can he be so fat at such a young age,\" he said. "

            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — She loved drinking bubble tea and whenever she felt stressed at work, she often snacked on “healthy” granola bars and fruit snacks.\nEven though she told her dentist that she always chose reduced-sugar food items and that she was diligent about her oral hygiene routine, she was having several oral health problems at the age of 30.\nDr James Ho, founder and chief executive officer of GPlus Dental Center and G Dental Center, said that despite the young officer worker was having cavities and gum inflammation, which made her swollen gums bleed easily whenever she brushed her teeth.\nThe enamel surface of her teeth also showed signs of erosion, leading to tooth sensitivity.\nFor many Singaporeans, snacking throughout the day is not just a casual indulgence; it is a way of life. However, the frequent consumption of sugar-laden treats and beverages has come at a cost to their oral health.\nCoupled with poor dental habits, it is no wonder that a significant proportion of adults here have to deal with oral health problems and retaining their natural teeth as they age.\nThe latest National Adult Oral Health Survey in 2019 revealed that around a third (35 per cent) of Singaporeans aged 21 and above suffer from untreated dental caries.\nAdditionally, a staggering 94 per cent of adults were found to have gum disease, which if left untreated, can progress to more severe conditions and even tooth loss.\nIn 2020, the National Dental Centre Singapore (NDCS) launched the Oral Health Movement 8020, a pilot programme that encourages people aged 40 and above to maintain at least 20 of their natural teeth beyond the age of 80.\nIts pilot study involving 780 adults aged 40 and above found that around 17 per cent were in the orally pre-frail or had tipped into the orally frail state. This means that a decline in oral function affects their ability to chew, swallow and speak.\nA key factor contributing to oral frailty is the number of remaining teeth.\nDr Chan Pei Yuan, the programme lead for the Oral Health Movement 8020, noted that the programme has brought attention to the low awareness and prioritisation of oral health among Singaporeans.\nDr Chan also pointed out that the National Adult Oral Health Survey found that more than a third (34.4 per cent) of the adults surveyed visited the dentist only when they experienced a problem with their teeth, mouth or dentures.\nRegular cleaning and preventive care are key to keeping your teeth and gums healthy.\nDr Lee Wan Zhen, head of the periodontics unit with the department of restorative dentistry at NDCS, said: “Those who neglect regular dental check-ups and fail to address cavities in their early stages are at risk of losing their natural teeth permanently.”\nDr Ho cautioned: “Delaying dental care can worsen cavities, requiring invasive treatments like root canals or extractions, while untreated gum disease may lead to costly procedures such as preventable gum surgery or tooth loss.\n“Similarly, ignoring a cracked tooth can result in infections, necessitating expensive treatments like dental crowns or root canals.”\nThe dental experts listed below some common habits that are bad for your teeth and gums, along with what you can do to save your teeth and improve your oral health.\nSome people who are trying to lose weight believe that snacking or grazing on small meals throughout the day helps to boost metabolism rate.\nNot only is this not a proven claim, it is bad for your teeth because taking frequent small meals or snacks throughout the day does not give saliva enough time to neutralise acids in the mouth.\nHowever, being constantly on the move and juggling demanding work and personal schedules may mean that many younger adults tend to snack, rather than adhere to proper mealtimes, he said.\n“They also have a higher tendency to skip meals or have irregular meal patterns, since they eat when they feel is convenient to them.\n“Saliva production typically increases during meal times. Skipping meals or frequent snacking, especially when you snack outside of regular mealtimes, means there will be less saliva to help rinse away food particles and neutralise acids in the mouth, increasing the risk of cavities and gum disease,” he said.\nDr Lee from NDCS explained that while eating or drinking, especially foods high in sugar or acids, the pH level in the mouth becomes more acidic, meaning the pH level becomes lower.\nWhen the pH levels fall below a certain critical level, the enamel that is the hard outer structure of teeth starts to dissolve.\n“Snacking throughout the day exposes teeth to a constant source of sugars that can be used by the oral bacteria to produce acids.\n“With frequent snacking, this acidic environment can persist for an extended period below the critical pH level (of 5.5), thereby providing ample time for acids to erode enamel and dentine (the middle layer of the tooth) and weaken teeth.\n“If snacking replaces meals or if snacks are low in water content, it can result in low salivary flow. Reduced saliva flow means less protection against acid attacks, increasing the risk of tooth decay,” Dr Lee added.\nWHAT YOU CAN DO:\nHave regular meals at fixed timings. This results in fewer acid attacks on the teeth, compared to continuous snacking, Dr Lee said.\n“Meals consumed at regular hours are followed by a period of time before the next meal, allowing time for saliva to neutralise acids and re-mineralise teeth between eating episodes,” she explained.\nDr Ho said that continuous chewing — for at least 20 minutes — during regular mealtimes stimulates higher saliva flow.\n“Saliva contains essential minerals like calcium and phosphate, which help in the re-mineralisation process, repairing early signs of enamel erosion and decay.”\nDr Lee advised having three balanced meals a day and if needed, to take oral health-friendly snacks in between (see point below).\nPopular sugary snacks and drinks that are sticky and chewy such as kueh, glutinous rice balls, mochi and bubble tea with its add-on gelatinous items in the form of jelly and tapioca balls tend to adhere to teeth, filling crevices and spaces for extended periods of time, promoting bacterial growth.\nEven dishes such as fried carrot cake with sweet dark soya sauce, mee siam and mee rebus has high sugar content.\nA diet high in sugar, acidic foods and beverages can contribute to tooth decay and erosion. This can weaken the enamel surface of teeth, making teeth more susceptible to cracking and also lead to tooth loss over time.   \nThe types of food and drinks considered acidic are citrus fruit such as oranges, vinegar-based salad dressings and health products such as apple cider vinegar.\nDr Lee said that people who engage in an active lifestyle or play sports regularly might consume isotonic energy drinks, which can be high in sugars and acids.\nPeople may also drink sweetened caffeinated beverages such as instant coffee or caffeinated energy drinks to stay awake, most of which contain sugars, she added.\nBesides weakening tooth enamel, excessive sugar intake fuels bacteria in the mouth that can cause cavities.\nWHAT YOU CAN DO:\nPick nutritious snacks that are low in sugar and acids, while high in nutrients such as fibre, calcium and vitamins. Some examples are:\nDr Ho also said that although the choice of snacks may be important, it is not just acidic or sugary foods and beverages that may solely and directly affect oral health.\n“In the aftermath of snacking, take care of food particles that can become lodged between teeth, which promote bacterial growth and increase the risk of dental issues.\n“Post-snacking oral hygiene practices can help to reduce potential oral health problems. Do what is practically possible, like swishing water in your mouth after meals.\n“To minimise direct contact between sweet drinks and teeth, consider using a straw, which can reduce the risk of enamel erosion and tooth decay.\n“To minimise plastic, there are eco-friendly stainless steel straws and bamboo straws alternatives,” he added.\nThe dentists also suggested consuming sugary or acidic food and drinks as part of a meal — for example, at the end of the meal — rather than as snacks throughout the day or a standalone snack. The increased saliva production during meals would help neutralise the acids.\n“Try to avoid snacking right before bedtime because saliva production decreases during sleep, leaving teeth more vulnerable to acids.\n“If you must snack at night, opt for a small low-sugar snack, drink water and brush your teeth afterward,” Dr Lee advised.\nDr Ho pointed out that some research suggested that brushing teeth immediately after consuming something acidic can damage the enamel, so it may be advisable to wait around 30 minutes before brushing.\nHowever, removing food that stick between teeth should be done right after meals, either by flossing or even using a toothpick, he said.\nIf you do not drink enough plain water throughout the day, it can lead to a dry mouth, increasing the risk of cavities due to reduced salivary flow, Dr Lee said.\nWHAT YOU CAN DO:\nStaying adequately hydrated — with plain water — is essential for maintaining saliva production and good oral health.\nRinsing the mouth with water after consuming sweet beverages and food can also reduce teeth’s exposure to sugars and acids.\n“It helps to dilute and to wash away some of the sugar and acid residues, which can lessen the risk of tooth decay and enamel erosion,” Dr Ho advised.\nWhen munching on hard, crunchy food, it is advisable to exercise caution because that is a common cause of dental emergencies such as cracked teeth or lost fillings.\n“Hard, crunchy snacks can be detrimental to dental health as they can cause microscopic fractures in tooth enamel. In this hot weather, I also caution my patients against chewing on ice cubes,” Dr Ho said.\nExamples of hard food items that can cause such tiny fractures over time include nuts, potato chips or certain types of biscuits such as pretzel biscuits.\nThat said, the extent of damage can vary, based on other factors such as dental health, enamel strength and some eating habits.\nFor instance, teeth grinding, trauma from accidents or sports injury may weaken the tooth structure. Or habits such as cracking open chicken bone or crab shells using teeth can also cause stress fractures to accumulate on teeth, which may result in cracked or split teeth over time, Dr Lee said.\nFor denture wearers, consuming hard, crunchy snacks can be problematic as well.\n“These snacks can exert excessive pressure on dentures, leading to discomfort, soreness or even damage to the dentures.\n“Also, hard food may cause dentures to become dislodged or loosen, increasing the risk of injury to the mouth or throat,” Dr Ho said.\nAnd on one other point, Dr Ho emphasised that “teeth are not tools”. Use the proper tools intended for opening packages and bottles or to crack hard nuts.\n“Once, a patient told me that whenever she could not rip a snack packaging apart, she would use her teeth instead.\n“I strongly advise not to use your teeth to open bottles, packages or perform other tasks because it can lead to chipping or other damage,” he said.\nWHAT YOU CAN DO:\nDr Ho has the following tips for minimising the risk of cracked teeth while eating harder or crunchy food.\nDr Chan, a consultant at the department of restorative dentistry in NDCS, said that for people with teeth grinding or clenching habits, managing stress or using a mouthguard can help prevent cracked teeth and preserve natural teeth.\nThen, there are parafunctional habits such as clenching of teeth, frequently chewing on hard foods, which can cause problems.\nWearing a mouthguard when playing sports or doing high-impact activities such as skateboarding is also helpful.\nRegular dental check-ups are essential to detect and treat any emerging problems, which can prevent dental problems from progressing  and leading to tooth loss later in life, Dr Chan added.\nNot brushing and flossing properly, or missing spots when cleaning allow plaque to build up on teeth and gums.\nBrushing and flossing are integral in preventing tooth decay because they remove the “food source” for the bacteria that causes tooth decay.\nIf there is a thick biofilm of dental plaque, saliva cannot penetrate between teeth to help re-mineralise and reverse some of the acid damage on teeth, Dr Lee said.\nUrging young adults not to delay or neglect routine dental check-ups due to their busy schedules, Dr Ho said that this group of adults may have the perception that they are healthy and do not see the need to visit their dentist regularly.\nThis is not true at all.\nImproving oral health requires a joint effort between home oral care and guidance provided by a dentist, he added.\nBesides detecting and treating issues early, a dentist can also give personalised instruction on how to brush and floss your teeth properly based on the person’s dental profile.\nWHAT YOU CAN DO:\nDr Ho advised dedicating three to four minutes to oral care routine at least twice a day using a fluoride toothpaste.\nIncorporate flossing into your daily routine to clean between teeth and remove plaque from areas that your toothbrush may not reach.\nSelecting the right dental products matter, too.\nUse a toothpaste with fluoride to help neutralise harmful acid and strengthen the enamel.  \nDr Ho advised choosing a toothbrush with soft bristles and consider using an antiseptic or fluoride mouthwash as a form of supplementary oral care.\nAddressing the misconception that brushing harder or using a hard bristle brush removes more plaque, he said: “We sometimes hear dentists say, ‘Don't brush your teeth like you are scrubbing the kitchen floor’.\n“This is to emphasise to patients the need for gentle, circular motions rather than harsh scrubbing.\n“Using hard bristle brushes and brushing too vigorously can be harmful to oral health rather than beneficial.”\nDr Ho also said that although some studies may suggest potential risks of long-term mouthwash use, such as cancer, the evidence is inconclusive.\n“Using mouthwash with fluoride regularly is beneficial after brushing and flossing. If you have just had oral surgery, and your dentist advises that you use mouthwash containing chlorohexidine, then you should do so.\n“Always consult your dentist and voice out any concerns that you may have. It is important to cultivate a trusting relationship with your dentist by having open communication,” he said.\nSchedule regular dental visits at least once a year, or as advised by your dentist. Dr Ho said that it is advisable to, where possible, try to stick with a regular dentist.\n“Dentist-hopping could perhaps lead to delay in detecting and treating dental issues and cause more permanent damage down the road.”"

            "Article Body": "Please be advised that the articles delve into trauma-related topics that may be triggering to the reader.\nSINGAPORE — Adverse childhood experiences are potentially traumatic events that occur in a child’s life before the age of 18.\nSome of them are harmful and obvious when there is abuse and maltreatment. Others are less apparent but equally traumatic such as enduring pain from an injury or prolonged hospitalisation, not fitting in among peers and emotional neglect from parents.\nIn children and teenagers who are still growing physically, cognitively and emotionally, these early adverse experiences can leave a negative imprint on their development, behaviour and health right into adulthood.\nIn an ideal world, every child will grow up safe, loved and supported. Yet, painful and distressing experiences are sometimes unavoidable, and not every child has the inner resources and capacity to bounce back on their own from the shock or hurt.\nSo what are the signs to watch for in children and teenagers who are traumatised? And what can be done to help them recover from an adverse childhood experience or traumatic event?\nOne thing is clear and especially crucial: The presence of a safe and nurturing environment and equivalent relationships. Just one consistent adult figure who can provide love and care is the key to help them start healing.\nHowever, an important step is to first acknowledge the occurrence of a traumatic experience, because healing cannot begin in silence or denial.\nAdjunct Associate Professor Daniel Fung, chief executive officer of the Institute of Mental Health (IMH),  said: “We need to recognise that there was a potentially traumatic event and help the child to deal with it.\n“There’s a saying that a burden shared is a burden halved.\n“I've seen a number of children where the parents are really in denial of something that has happened in the family when it's clear that there was abuse. And that’s painful for the child.”\nAlthough different children may process a traumatic event differently, some tell-tale signs to pay attention to are:\nResearch from the Singapore Children’s Society found that having one or more consistent, safe attachment adult figure in the child’s life can help the child bounce back after adversity.\nIn the absence of parents, these adults may be other family members, family friends, school counsellors, teachers, befrienders, mentors or neighbours.\nWhat if parents or immediate family cannot provide support or continue to be the source of trauma, for example, in cases of child abuse or ill-treatment?\nSenior clinical psychologist Jeremy Heng said that in such cases, professional agencies such as Family Service Centres and the Child Protective Service under the Ministry of Social and Family Development will work with other adults in the child’s life to establish safety.\nHe added: “Having someone who trusts in you, who tells you that whatever negative things that have happened is not your fault, that you are safe, are loved and wanted, that you belong, are good enough and that the future is hopeful.\n“These messages help ground a child and give them an opportunity to develop healthily and thrive in spite of their adverse childhood experiences.”\nMr Heng is the deputy head of Sunbeam Place at Singapore Children’s Society, a residential home for abused and neglected children.\nThere, for example, the residential care workers are parental figures for many of the young residents. Not only do they provide care, they also gently guide them to correct their mistakes using “teachable moments”.\nMr Heng illustrated how it often takes a village to support traumatised children: An eight-year-old was referred to Sunbeam Place after prolonged harsh physical punishment and emotional rejection by her parents.\nWhen she was first admitted, her intense emotional and behavioural outbursts often meant that she was biting, punching and scratching the staff members.\nA group people were roped in to give the necessary support: A psychologist, residential care workers, a child development team and social workers.\n“Currently, the teenager (now aged 14) is thriving in secondary school and is vice-captain for her sports co-curricular activity. She copes well with distress and relational conflicts, using her preferred emotional regulation strategies,” Mr Heng said.\n“She also encourages and takes care of younger residents (at Sunbeam Place)who struggle with managing their difficult emotions because they remind her of her younger self.\n“Most importantly, she is going home to her family in the next few months because both the professionals and her family have expressed confidence in a safe and stable reunification.”\nReferring to Singapore Children’s Society’s research, Mr Heng said that when children who perceived that they had no one or only a few people whom they can turn to for emotional support, those who were exposed to more adverse childhood experiences had more of what is known as “internalising problems”, which are the feelings that develop internally such as anxiety, social withdrawal and depression.\nWhen they perceived that they had more people to turn to, they were less likely to experience these feelings.\nMr Heng said that receiving the appropriate intervention after a traumatic event is critical. This is to ensure that the child feels safe and is not in immediate danger or harm.\nIt helps the child make sense of what has happened and reduce the likelihood of psychological troubles later.\n“No other intervention may be effective if the harm continues,” he added.\nClinical psychologist Claire Ng from IMH said that trauma-focused work with children often involves working closely with families and communities.\n“A large part of the work is helping children and families understand the impact of trauma on children,” she said.\n“This helps families develop empathy for the child who may have difficulties regulating their emotions and behaviour after experiencing trauma.\n“Another important part of the work is also helping caregivers understand how to help the child feel safe, both physically and emotionally.”\nMs Ng is with IMH’s department of developmental psychiatry and the forensic rehabilitation, intervention, evaluation and network development services (Friends).\nTrauma Systems Therapy is one form of therapy used that actively involves the caregivers and communities to support the child:\nAn approach called Trauma-informed Positive Behavioural Interventions and Supports (TI-PBIS) is used in the residential care setting at Sunbeam Place under the Singapore Children’s Society.\nIt is a system of care that equips children with adaptive behaviours that help them regulate their emotions and form positive social connections.\nTo promote social connections, each of its six dormitories is set up to resemble a typical Singaporean household, with a living room, study room and bedrooms.\nThe residents have daily routines and activities that are mundane but critical in promoting positive behaviour and social interaction, Mr Heng said.\nFor example, having meals together and sharing about their day, deciding on activities to do as a group and studying together.\nBesides letting the residents feel they are safe and loved, can trust others and have control, the recurring positive interactions allow them to “unlearn” maladaptive interaction patterns such as being aggressive to protect themselves, and to learn healthier ways to relate to others.\n“They also learn skills to tolerate distress and regulate themselves using more effective and healthier methods.\n“This is why having one or more consistent safe and trusted adult attachment figures is so critical to scaffold, guide and promote the learning of necessary skills to support the recovery of these children and youth,” Mr Heng explained.\nIn Singapore, various programmes are in place to support traumatised children. The following are just a few of them.\n1. INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH\n2. SINGAPORE CHILDREN’S SOCIETY\nMs Ang Jia Yi, a counsellor at Yishun Family Service under the Singapore Children’s Society, said: “The aim is to reduce the likelihood of individuals developing more severe distress and trauma symptoms. The majority of them return to normalcy with adequate support.”\n3. KK WOMEN’S AND CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL\nDr Yeleswarapu Padmini, senior consultant with KKH’s department of child development, said: “(Information on) the history of non-accidental injuries could come from one of the parents, community agency supporting the family or from preschool if they have identified any signs and symptoms suggestive of any non-accidental injuries.\n“At the same time, a detailed evaluation of the child and information gathered by the medical social worker as part of the social evaluation would also be considered.”\nDr Padmini added that children who are exposed to adverse childhood experiences often come from families that have competing needs. These may include financial concerns or the child’s caregiver could have mental health ailments.\nOne of the advantages of receiving help through the Anchor programme is that the interventions are carried out in the family's home. \nThe team — consisting of various professionals — comes up with individualised plans to address the specific challenges that the child and family have. \nFor example, children exposed to a significant traumatic event will get support from a psychologist who can provide more trauma-focused interventions.\nFor children with health or developmental problems, they will be supported by paediatricians and allied health professionals. \nMs Ng from IMH said that humans are innately wired to seek connection and learn about themselves, others and the world through the eyes of their early caregivers.\n“If a child can rely on safe, reliable caregivers to meet their needs, they develop a mental model of the world as a safe place.\n“This perception of a secure base allows them to explore the world with confidence, develop healthy relationships, manage setbacks effectively and so on,” she explained.\nUnderstanding the impact of adverse childhood experiences and the struggles that families face spurred Morning Star Community Services to launch a free evening “drop-in” service in 2016.\nThe child may be dropped off at the centre where it runs its CareNights programme, which supports lower-income families in need who require care for their children on weekday nights.\nThis gives parents time at night for work or to take courses to improve their skills. This also allows them to get a respite for families going through a difficult time such as those undergoing divorce or attending to critically ill family members.\nCareNights also conduct parenting workshops and organise parent-child bonding activities such as outings and birthday celebrations for children who attends CareNights and their families.\nA large proportion of families that place their children with CareNights are single-parent households. It currently supports 63 children across four centres.\nMr Lemuel Yanos Baculanta, the programme’s assistant manager, said: “Supporting parents is crucial in addressing and mitigating adverse childhood experiences because parents play a vital role in shaping a child’s environment and experiences.”\nAs for the children, the programme’s aim is also to provide a secure and nurturing environment for them where they feel secure and accepted, and are heard and understood.\nA recent case that Mr Baculanta encountered is an eight-year-old girl, whose father was put up at a nursing home due to deteriorating dementia. He had shown verbally violent behaviour.\nThe mother, the sole breadwinner in the family, works extra hours at night and during weekends to make ends meet.\nConfused and frustrated by the changes, the girl confided in a CareNights mentor that she had thoughts of self-harm and was curious about a “happy pill” (presumed to be a drug) that she had discovered while watching content fromYouTube.\nThe mentor immediately advised the child’s mother to limit the girl’s access to such online content. After learning about her daughter’s thoughts of self-harm, the mother also communicated the self-harm concerns to the school counsellor.\nEmphasising the importance of having trusted adults in the child’s life to buffer the impact of adverse childhood experiences, Mr Baculanta said: “Currently, the child is thriving and starting to express joyfulness despite her family situation. She feels more confident and secure, knowing that there are people (CareNights’ mentors and volunteers) aside from her family who are concerned for her well-being.”\nDr Fung from IMH said that even with such an ecosystem around a child, and social agencies and organisations may be able to provide tangible help and support, they still cannot provide the love that families can give.\n“There’s a need for love, but love is not something that I can prescribe, though I wish I could,” the child psychiatrist added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- RoundBox@Children's Society (Toa Payoh): 6259 3735 (Mon to Fri, 9am to 6pm)\n- Vox@Children's Society (Chai Chee): 6443 4139 (Mon to Fri, 9am to 6pm)\n- JYC@Children's Society (Jurong): 6566 6989 (Mon, Wed and Fri, 8.45am to 5.45pm)\n- The Fort@Children's Society (Radin Mas): 6276 5077 (Mon to Fri, 8.30am to 5.30pm)"

Another passenger died from severe burns days later.\nThe tragedy would go on to change Ms Diyana’s childhood. \nOnce “the playful parent” she looked to for fun activities, her father became solemn and reserved after that, isolating himself in a room at home most of the time. \nDespite her young age then, she sensed that something had changed drastically.\nNow aged 23, the entertainment producer and filmmaker has written and directed a short film called Paper Planes, Don’t Always Soar — inspired by her childhood experience living with her father’s post-traumatic stress.\nShe told TODAY: “My mother, the only adult at home, and I were constantly vigilant and alert.  \n“We had to halt our daily routines because certain triggers, like the smell of fire or a lit gas stove while cooking, the scent of frangipanis or even my baby brother crying, would set my dad off, leading to anger, irritation or aggression.”\nThe scent of frangipanis was linked to the burial, funerals and deaths of her dad’s friends and colleagues.  \nShe added: “As a child, it took me a while to comprehend and accept the change in him.” \nGrowing up with a parent who was mentally unwell, she recalled the difficult period during her childhood: “Unlike my friends who spent their days playing, I found myself taking a more mature role early, supporting my mother and caring for my little brother. \n“At the time, it felt unfair, a childhood somewhat ‘lost’.”  \nEven though this experience is deeply personal, Ms Diyana’s early struggles with adversity are not uncommon. \nEvery two in three adults in Singapore have experienced at least one adverse childhood experience in their lives before the age of 18. \nThis was among the key findings of a study here published in the Child Abuse and Neglect Journal in 2020 — the first Singapore study on adverse childhood experiences. \nThe study was part of the Singapore Mental Health Study 2016 conducted by researchers at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH).\nThe term “adverse childhood experience” refers to a potentially traumatic situation or event that a person may face or witness while growing up. \nLiving with a household member who is mentally unwell is just one example. \nResearch into potentially traumatic events in childhood has highlighted their far-reaching harmful effects, which may persist well into adulthood. \nHowever, not all types of adverse experiences are obviously traumatic, and not every child is affected in the same way.  \nSome may be able to manage the situation, whereas others require support and help.  \nAdjunct Associate Professor Daniel Fung, chief executive officer of the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), said: “For example, when you’re young and you have an illness that keeps you in hospital for two months.\n\"You recover from the illness but that separation from your family could be quite traumatic, and may have repercussions in the longer term. \n“That can also be considered potentially traumatic although on the surface, it doesn't appear toxic, but that could potentially be a traumatic event.”\nIn the 2016 IMH study, the most prevalent adverse childhood experience reported was emotional neglect. Around 46 per cent of the adult respondents experienced this.\nThis was followed by: \nChildhood emotional neglect is when the child’s emotional needs are consistently overlooked, ignored or not adequately met by their caregivers during the formative years.  \nWhen asked what emotional neglect might look like in families, Dr Fung from IMH said: “In today's Singapore context, it would mean that there might be adults around but they are not providing (love and) care for the child.” \nIn a separate study by the Singapore Children’s Society, which surveyed 270 pairs of caregivers and children from low-income families from 2017 to 2019, the common adverse childhood experiences the children faced were:  \nMs Toh Sze Min, a research officer with the Singapore Children’s Society, said: “As the sample of children were from low-income families, some possible reasons where these adverse childhood experiences were common could be that children from these families might have lived in neighbourhoods that were less safe. \n“They might have been bullied in school because they were not able to fit in with their peers due to the family’s low income. \n“Individuals in multi-stressed populations were more vulnerable and at higher risk of offending behaviours that may lead to (serving time in prison).” \nDr Yeleswarapu Padmini, senior consultant with the department of child development at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH), said that exposure to adverse experiences during the critical early years of life can have significant and lasting effects on cognitive development, and how the person regulates behaviour and emotions.\n“These can contribute to difficulties in learning, social interactions and ultimately, have an impact on educational and employment outcomes in the long term.” \nLeft unchecked, experiencing hardships in childhood can cause toxic stress. \nClinical psychologist Claire Ng said that while some level of stress can be “healthy for development”, stress that is unrelenting, pervasive and overwhelming becomes detrimental. \n“Psychological stress is considered ‘extreme’ when it overwhelms the child’s internal capacity and inner resources to cope,” she added. \nMs Ng is with the department of developmental psychiatry and the forensic rehabilitation, intervention, evaluation and network development services at IMH.  \nLikening extreme stress to a car engine that is revved up for long periods every day, Ms Ng explained: “Eventually, it results in wear and tear that heightens the risk of stress-related physical health issues. \n“This (type of stress) is particularly problematic for children as they are undergoing critical developmental periods. \n“Toxic stress can affect the brain’s developing structure. This means it doesn’t just affect the child’s current well-being, it also has lasting effects on their capacity to tolerate stressors in the future.” \nFor example, children who were maltreated were found to have:\nFindings from research into the long-term health effects are just as troubling. \n“Exposure to adverse childhood experiences increases the chance of health problems in adulthood, ranging from cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune disorders, cancers, mental health problems, among others,” Dr Padmini from KKH said.\nMs Toh from Singapore Children’s Society said that findings from its aforementioned 2017 to 2019 study have shown that children who were exposed to more adverse childhood experiences tended to have “poorer life satisfaction, school engagement and social-emotional competence”.  \nNew research based on a nationwide sample of more than 25,000 pairs of twins in Sweden reinforced this. \nThe Swedish study found that the effects of adverse childhood experience were “dose-dependent”, with each additional adverse experience associated with 52 per cent greater odds of any psychiatric disorder later in life. \nThe study was published in the Jama Psychiatry peer-reviewed journal last month. \nThe IMH study found that experiencing just one adverse childhood experience placed the person at a considerably higher risk (3.7 times more likely) of developing a mood or anxiety disorder, compared to those whose childhood were unblemished by an adverse event. \nThose with an adverse childhood experience was also 4.2 times more likely to have suicidal thoughts, and plan and attempt suicide. \nThe effects of an adverse childhood experience may not end with the victim: Past trauma can affect subsequent relationships and leave an imprint across generations. \nMs Ang Jia Yi, a counsellor at Yishun Family Service at Singapore Children’s Society, said that parents who have experienced childhood trauma themselves may normalise adverse experiences or struggle to recognise that there are healthier alternatives for their children. \n“They may unknowingly perpetuate patterns of trauma within the family and expose their children to similar adversities,” she added. \nDr Fung from IMH said that intergenerational transmission of abuse can result in changed behaviour and perception of what normal relationships are. \n“For example, for someone who has been coercively abused, whether physical or sexual, they may view relationships as centred around satisfying the needs of the more powerful caregiver. \n“When they become caregivers themselves, they may relive that kind of trauma on the next generation, becoming abusers themselves. \n“If you study paedophilia and other kinds of sexual disorders called paraphilias, there often is a history of some level of abuse of a similar nature in the childhood, though not all (have experienced childhood abuse),” he added. \nMs Ng the clinical psychologist wanted to stress that not all abuse victims go on to become perpetrators themselves. \n“Many victims go on to thrive and experience post-traumatic growth (positive changes after exposure to trauma) where they go on to live meaningful lives.” \nNot everyone who has had a rough childhood suffers irreparable damage, but the potential fallout is significant enough such that researchers and experts are working to find ways to mitigate its effects. \nIn Singapore, there are programmes and interventions in place to support traumatised children. (More details will be available in the second part of this series.)\nExperts told TODAY that it is crucial to address adverse childhood experiences and provide appropriate intervention as early as possible. \n“Trauma-focused work with children often requires working close with families and communities. \n“A large part of the work is helping children and families understand the impact of trauma on children,” Ms Ng said. \nDr Fung said that education is key. \nUnderstanding what would potentially traumatise a child and its potential impact are an important preventative step. \nSo is the presence of safe, secure, nurturing relationships in the child’s life, particularly when times are tough. \n“Even if a child has gone through a potentially traumatic situation, providing a safe, secure and nurturing environment is actually protective,” Dr Fung said. \n“Suppose there’s an accident and the child (is the sole survivor). Can you still save the child (from potential long-term effects of trauma)? \n“Yes, you can, if there’s a caregiver who loves them. Maybe a grandparent who can keep them safe, nurture them and help them process what has happened.” \nMr Jeremy Heng, senior clinical psychologist and deputy head of Sunbeam Place at Singapore Children’s Society, a residential home for abused and neglected children, said: “From what we know from research and our work at Children’s Society, the other most important factor is having one consistent safe attachment adult figure, or more, in the child’s life.” \nDespite his mental health struggles after surviving the plane crash, Mr Amir’s love for his family came through later. \nA combination of medical intervention, therapy sessions and unwavering support from family and friends helped him and his family heal. \nMs Diyana said: “There wasn’t a singular defining moment that marked the turning point in my dad’s recovery.\n“Instead, it was more of a gradual realisation, a click of understanding that I had observed in him that resonated deeply with me.\n“Slowly but surely, we began seeing glimpses of his old self returning.” This was about two years after the disaster. \nShe recalled that their relationship improved when she was around five years old.\nIn the short film Paper Planes, Don’t Always Soar, Ms Diyana tried to capture that subtle yet profound shift with a scene of her family huddling together after a storm. \n“It symbolised not just the aftermath of a literal storm but also the emotional and psychological challenges we had weathered together,” she said. \n“It felt as if my dad suddenly saw us and understood that he wasn’t alone, that we were all there, willing to support him through his struggles. \n“That realisation seemed to act as a catalyst for him to begin opening up, allowing himself to be vulnerable and to lean on us as he took steps towards recovery.” \nToday, the family has not just “moved on” from the experience; they grew and became stronger as a unit. \n“My relationship with my dad is better than ever now. It’s evolved into something truly special… open, fun and deeply connected. \n“We enjoy each other’s company and we find joy in the simplest of moments together,” Ms Diyana said.  \nHer father’s battle with adversity shaped her own approach to handling life’s challenges. \nShe recalled feeling scared whenever her baby brother cried because that would trigger her father. She would also put on a brave front and help out at home, such as fold her own school uniform.\nLooking back, she realised that she ended up spending more time at home after the incident, and that made her closer to her mother and little brother. \nShe said that she never felt resentful or bitter. To her, it felt like they were all going through a difficult situation together. \nIt taught her the value of patience and understanding. Instead of reacting impulsively in times of adversity, it was crucial to pause, reflect and look past the surface of the problem, she added. \n“With hindsight, I see the immense impact it had on my personal growth. The experience accelerated my maturity, equipping me with a depth of understanding and empathy that has been invaluable through my teenage years and into adulthood. \n“It taught me to navigate complex situations and understand people beyond the surface,” she said. \nShe also saw how important open communication was in overcoming hard times.  \n“I’ve come to realise that trying to navigate trauma or any problems in isolation only amplifies the pain and can hinder healing. Speaking up and confiding in people I trust has been important. \n“It’s a reminder that sharing our burdens doesn’t make us weaker but opens the door to support and insight.” \nThat was why she made the film. “Making the film was not just a creative outlet for me, but a deliberate effort to communicate and connect (with people) on issues often shrouded in silence. \n“My hope is that by sharing these stories, we can illuminate the shared aspects of our human experience, encourage others to speak up, seek support and find solace in the fact that they are not alone.”\nPaper Planes, Don’t Always Soar will screen at an Institute of Mental Health event next Saturday (April 20) from 10.30am to 12.15pm. \nMs Diyana Amir, Dr Daniel Fung, Ms Claire Ng and other mental health experts will discuss the impact of intergenerational trauma on youth mental health.

            "Article Summary": "People are moving less while obesity rates have gone up, a recent health survey in Singapore found.\nBarriers in modern life, such as having not enough time and a focus on other priorities, make it harder for people to be motivated to exercise.\nFrom an evolutionary point of view, the body tends to take the easy way out to accomplish tasks, an expert said.\nA psychologist and personal trainer gave psychological and practical tips on how to overcome inertia.\nHaving jobs that demand a lot of our time.\nWork-at-home arrangements that limit incidental movement.\nFamily obligations such as caregiving responsibilities.\nFestivities such as Christmas and Chinese New Year that disrupt routines, making it challenging to get back to some form of exercise.\nIndulging in rich foods during major seasonal celebrations can lead to feelings of lethargy and guilt, further deterring motivation.\nIn the pre-modern world, having adequate energy was crucial for survival.\nIn the Paleolithic era (also known as the Old Stone Age), humans endured strenuous labour, using their energy primarily in hunting and gathering.\nThey also rested as much as possible to save up energy for the next round of demanding activities .\nLifestyles have changed in the past 10,000 years from the late Paleolithic era to the present.\nIn modern times, technological advancements have made life more convenient and we no longer move as much for survival.\nHowever, the human body has not adapted at the same pace and still operates according to ancient survival instincts.\nThis tendency to \"conserve energy\" and rest thus makes it challenging to initiate physical activity.\nInstead of rewarding yourself each time you do something good, this method involves delivering reward at irregular intervals.\nMr Boh the psychologist pointed out that the intended effect of not knowing what you may get is why some people become addicted to gambling.\n“They don't get their reward all the time, but it is the thrill of getting a reward, a win, that makes it so addictive.”.\nTo increase motivation for exercise, use the same technique — randomising the chance of a reward.\nFor example, you can tell yourself, ‘After I exercise, I will toss a coin. If it’s heads, I’ll give myself a reward but if it’s tails, then none’.\nThe reward can involve something that you like, such as unwinding with a movie or treating yourself to a small gift.\nOr mix it up with longer-term weekly or monthly goals, and then aim for a larger reward such as investing in new exercise clothing or going for a massage.\nEngage in some positive self-talk.\n“The brain has a way of believing something that you say,” Mr Boh said.\n“With exercise, you don’t have to pretend to like it. But do tell yourself, ‘It’s not easy but I can handle this’.\".\nMr Boh is referring to simple exercises such as brisk-walking or a slow jog, “not Olympic endeavours such as running a marathon or lifting 100kg”.\nEngaging in positive self-talk encourages the brain to continue to sustain effort in doing challenging things.\nWith consistency, exercising can become a habit, akin to brushing your teeth.\n“After exercising consistently for a while, you may notice feeling more energetic, fitter and lighter,\" Mr Chia said.\nExercise provides a dopamine boost, providing an immediate mood boost and sense of accomplishment after a workout .\nDopamine is a hormone and neurotransmitter that plays a role in giving feelings of pleasure, motivation and learning.\nIt may feel frustrating and difficult at first, but the amygdala (part of the brain involved in reward learning and motivation) will slowly create arousal and gradually, the brain will perceive it more positively, Mr Boh said.\nBefore starting an exercise session, visualising a positive outcome can help boost motivation.\nThis may be imagining how good you will feel, eating a healthy meal or getting a deeper post-workout sleep.\n“Mental savouring can increase dopamine for most people, especially for those who are half-hearted about exercise,” Mr Boh said.\nThis may not work for some people who dislike exercising.\nFor this group, visualise what might happen if you continue to remain sedentary and avoid exercise: Getting a stroke or heart attack or cancer.\n“The fear will then nudge them a bit because some people may get motivated by fear, though, it’s not always the best (method),” Mr Boh added  .\nThat generate visible results, usually as part of a structured exercise plan.\nThat the person enjoys such as dancing (cue Madagascar's dance track) or swimming.\nA good rule of thumb is to include structured exercise 80 per cent of the time and activities or sports that you enjoy 20 per cent of the time.\nFor example, play basketball once a week alongside a routine of running or strength training four times a week.\nFor people who like company or socialising, have a workout buddy or sign up for group exercise classes or join a sports club.\nA workout buddy can keep you accountable to your goals .\nFor people who find it hard to be more active due to family obligations, exercise together as a family.\nIt can become time spent to bond, to catch up with each other and share a healthy post-workout meal .\nPrepare to exercise in advance, put it in your diary and choose a convenient location such as a gym or walking route near your home or workplace.\nInvest in simple equipment such as a yoga mat or a set of dumbbells if needed.\nRather than start off with an hour-long session of high-intensity exercise, take small manageable steps with lighter ones first",
            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — “I like to move it, move it,” the signature tune from the animated Hollywood film Madagascar goes.\nAnd health experts want you to know that it is really just moving your body in some way that counts when you want to start building your fitness level — no matter how short a duration, no matter if your marathon-running friend will scoff at your effort.\nBecause after a while, when you get into the groove and sustain it, biological functions will take care of the rest.\nIt has been drilled into us that physical activity is good for us and exercising regularly provides many benefits including better mental and cognitive health. \nResearch has shown that sitting all day and a sedentary lifestyle can kill us fast or raise cancer risks. And nothing beats some ailments and stress like a good workout, which gives us natural painkillers and mood-boosting chemicals.\nYet, many people are still not moving more or getting enough exercise.\nFitness professional Joel Chia said that sedentarism is a “pandemic”, given that people are moving less. He is a certified personal trainer and senior dietitian at Novi Health, a specialist medical centre that provides personalised solutions to manage chronic health conditions. \nThe National Population Health Survey 2022 released here late last year showed the same thing about physical activity levels.  \nIt found that the percentage of Singapore residents engaging in sufficient total physical activity — say, at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity physical activity — has gone down from 84.6 per cent in 2019 to 74.9 per cent in 2022.\nThis was chalked up to reduced commuting from hybrid work arrangements after the Covid-19 pandemic.\nAt the same time, obesity rates have increased by almost 35 per cent in the past decade — from 8.6 per cent in 2013 to 11.6 per cent for the 2021 to 2022 period.\nSo, what is stopping people from mustering the motivation to exercise?\nVarious barriers found in modern life make it hard for people to carve out the time and will to get moving.\nMr Chia gave some examples:\nRegistered psychologist Gerald Boh said that younger adults, in particular, may have “present bias” — the tendency to prioritise the rewards they can get now over long-term future benefits. \n“If you (tell them) that not exercising increases their risk of cardiovascular disease, a young person may say, ‘I’m still young enough that I can wait’. \n“Younger people will always have other more urgent priorities that they would want to take care of, like career, setting up a family, their finances.\n\"It’s not like they think that health is unimportant but rather, they don’t think it’s urgent enough yet.”\nMr Boh is the clinical director and principal psychologist at Okay-to-Chat, a private mental health service that uses a combination of face-to-face and e-counselling platforms. \nHe is also an exercise psychologist with PsyFit, which uses psychology, counselling and physical activity to improve health.\nPerhaps the most interesting research on why people find it hard to get started on exercise is that your brain is just not wired that way.\nWe want to rest more because it is an evolutionary mechanism.\nAssistant Professor Ivy Yeh from Nanyang Technological University has research expertise in biological anthropology, which is the study of human biological variation and evolution. \nShe and Mr Boh have these to say collectively:\nAsst Prof Yeh believes that chronic and lifestyle-related diseases such as diabetes will become even more prevalent in the next few decades, considering that the modern diet is richer in sugar compared to that in olden times.\nShe said: “Our innate tendency is always to seek the easiest path to accomplish tasks, yet the convenience may not always align with what’s best for health.\n“We may be increasing in lifespan, but more important is our ‘healthspan’ that is the number of years spent living an active lifestyle and doing what we enjoy in old age.”\nNow that we know why exercising — or even just moving more every day — does not come naturally to us, here are some psychological techniques to help increase and sustain motivation.  \nMr Boh advised against setting outcome goals such as “I want to lose weight”.\nInstead, set behavioural goals that are achievable and action-oriented such as \"I will brisk-walk for 30 minutes, five times a week for 12 weeks\".\nCertain types of physical activities tend to boost and sustain motivation, making regular exercise more sustainable.\nThese include exercises:\nHere are some tips from Mr Chia the personal trainer:\n“A partial workout still counts as exercise. Instead of a full hour of exercise, for example, try doing push-ups first thing in the morning,\" Mr Chia said.\n“Don’t count your exercise minutes; make your exercise count.” \nMr Boh emphasised that in getting people to increase their activity levels, “some exercise is better than none”. \n“If you can do more, that’s better. But the main idea is to keep moving because we have to look at physical activity in totality — exercise is just one aspect. \n“If you sit in a chair for 10 hours a day and brisk-walked for 30 minutes, you may gain some benefits from the brisk-walking.\n\"However, certain risks from sitting the whole day may not be remediated. \n“So we encourage people to just move more, without consciously (overthinking) it,” Mr Boh said.

            "Article Summary": "Detecting and treating cancer early improves treatment and survival outcomes .\nHowever, it can take months or even years before the person with cancer experiences any symptoms.\nDepending on various factors, some cancers' symptoms show up early, while others may remain hidden until the disease has spread.\nRegular screening and being alert to persistent or unexplained signs can help identify cancer early, doctors said.\nA 38-year-old told of how her cancer diagnosis was delayed for months because she thought her symptoms were due to stress and anxiety",
            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — It is well known that the earlier cancer is detected, the better chance of treating and surviving it.\nCancer that has spread becomes more complicated to treat, with those in the advanced stages generally having poorer outcomes. \nPeople whose cancer treatment is delayed by even a month have a 6 to 13 per cent higher risk of dying — a risk that continues rising the longer treatment is put off, a study published in 2020 in peer-reviewed medical journal The BMJ suggested. \nAs developed and affluent countries see higher cases of cancer among young people, it is becoming important that this group be made more aware of cancer symptoms so as not to get a delayed diagnosis.\nAs it is, a late diagnosis continues to be the norm in many cases despite advances in medicine. \nFor example, between 2018 and 2021, the majority of lung, stomach and pancreatic cancers were diagnosed in the later stages, based on data from the Singapore Cancer Registry Annual Report 2021. \nEven for colorectal cancer, which is among the most common cancers in Singapore, more than half of the diagnoses were after the disease advanced to Stage 3 and Stage 4.  \nJust how long can someone have cancer without knowing that something is seriously wrong? \nIn conjunction with World Cancer Day that was on Feb 4, TODAY asked doctors why some people may not be aware that some cells in their body have gone rogue, and what are the early signs not to ignore.\nMany factors can affect how early or late the cancer is detected: The type, where it is located, its speed of growth and the uptake for certain cancer screenings, the doctors said. \nDr Melvin Look, medical director of PanAsia Surgery and specialist in gastrointestinal cancer surgery, said that it may take “months or even years” before a person experiences any symptoms. \nHe explained: “All cancers initially start at the microscopic level. Because it’s so small, it’s both asymptomatic (no symptoms) and undetectable. \n“As the tumour slowly increases in size, it may still remain asymptomatic unless a person undergoes special screening tests to look for it.” \nEventually, the cancer grows and progresses to the “symptomatic-detectable” stage, Dr Look said.\n“The symptoms are usually due to the size of the tumour itself, causing a lump that can be painful or painless. \n“The lump can also cause secondary effects like bleeding or blockage of the organ cavity where it is located.” \nFor example, cancer of the upper gastrointestinal tract such as the oesophagus or stomach can cause vomiting, pain or difficulty swallowing.\nAs the cancer spreads to the rest of the body, it can cause symptoms specific to the organ. For example, back pain can be a sign of secondary cancer in the bone, Dr Look added. Secondary cancer is cancer that has spread from where it first originated.\nHow early symptoms show up may depend on where the cancer is located and the speed of growth.\n1. LOCATION OF THE CANCER OR ORGAN \nExplaining why some patients may not feel pain at first even when the cancer is growing, Dr Look said that a cancerous growth starts to cause pain or discomfort only if it invades the nearby nerves or cause a physical compression or obstruction to the organ.\n“If the cancer is in an organ that has a lot of space like the stomach, the mass needs to be very large before it causes symptoms.\n“On the other hand, a very early cancer can become symptomatic if it is located in an area that is visible, such as skin cancers, or they happen to produce alarming symptoms (such as bleeding from the nose in nasopharyngeal cancers),” Dr Look added. \nAnother example of a cancer that is hard to detect early due to its deep-seated location is ovarian cancer.\nDr Samuel Ow, Singapore Cancer Society’s council member and chairperson of the society’s community health committee, explained: “It’s because the ovaries are very small organs floating in the depths of the pelvis.\n“On the internet, you’ll see that many people call ovarian cancer the ‘silent whisperer’, so when the patient is diagnosed with ovarian cancer by the time she has symptoms, it’s often at stage three or four.”\nDr Ow is also a senior consultant with the department of haematology-oncology at National University Cancer Institute, Singapore.\n2. SPEED OF TUMOUR'S GROWTH\nDr Look said that some slow-growing tumours, in the thyroid or prostate for example, can remain asymptomatic for a very long time.\nDr Ow said: “Slow-growing cancers may not just be organ-specific. Even for breast cancer, there are slower-growing types of breast cancer and faster growing types. \n“For example, triple negative breast cancers are more aggressive than mucinous breast cancer and tubular breast cancer, which are very slow-growing.”\nSome people may disregard symptoms due to the mindset that “it won’t happen to me”, Dr Ow said.\n“Young working individuals who are typically healthy and exercise will not be thinking that they develop cancer, but can they happen to them? Yes, of course.” \nCancer was not on 38-year-old Nicole Tan’s mind when she started having unusual symptoms of swallowing difficulties and chest tightness late in 2020. \n“I went for medical check-ups and the doctors didn’t find anything abnormal, so I assumed that it was stress related and attributed it to anxiety. I didn’t think that it (was anything serious) at my relatively young age,” she said. \nBy April the next year, Ms Tan could no longer keep any food down, vomiting whenever she tried to eat and drink. She was rushed to the emergency department. \nIt turned out to be oesophageal cancer. The oesophagus is a long muscular tube that moves food from the throat to the stomach.\n“I was shocked and in disbelief for the first hour or so,” she said of what happened after she learnt of the cancer, which was at stage two or three.\nDr Look, who treated Ms Tan, said that many patients ignore symptoms because they think it is related to something commonplace such as stress or indigestion.\n“Young people, tend to delay seeking medical attention because they wrongly believe that cancer only happens in older people. Unfortunately, the incidence of cancer in younger people are in fact on the rise in Singapore,” Dr Look said.\nFor example, the age-standardised incidence rate of cancer in the 15 to 34 age group rose by more than 40 per cent — from 27 per 100,000 population between 1993 and 1997 to 39 per 100,000 between 2013 and 2017. \nThis is based on figures from the Singapore Cancer Registry 50th Anniversary Monograph. \nSome people have “a fear of knowing” and are in denial about their health concerns, Dr Ow said. \nHe once encountered a patient whose breast tumour grew so large (to about 16cm) that it broke through the skin. \nThe woman, who was in her 60s, said that she thought her skin was red as she had rubbed medicated oil and scratched it. Despite being within the recommended age for breast screening, the woman had never gone for a mammogram. \n“The reason why the cancer was detected was because she developed severe anaemia that made her breathless. Any lay person will know that it’s abnormal, to have something erupt from the breast,” he added. \n“I think deep down inside, these patients know (that something is wrong).\n“For (the breast cancer patient), her husband had passed away from pancreatic cancer a year before. I think that had been a traumatic process for her. \n“I suspect that the condition she faced had occurred while she was caring for her husband as well, so probably she was trying not to deviate from her role as a caregiver.” \nThankfully, not all hope was lost for the woman, whose cancer was at Stage 3. She underwent treatment and surgery.\n“Happy to say that it’s been eight years since, and she remains well,” Dr Ow said.\nIn Singapore, there are national screening guidelines for colorectal, cervical and breast cancer. These are common cancers that have proven screening strategies that affect outcomes.\n“The reason for screening is because we are trying to cause what we call a stage shift,” Dr Ow explained. \n“(Cancer) screening is supposed to try to shift the needle, from a later stage to an earlier stage, with the idea that the treatment for the cancer will become less complicated, potentially cause less burden on the healthcare system and also improve overall quality of life and lifespan.”\nThe doctors also advised people not to ignore symptoms, especially if they have gone on for some time. \n“The key words are ‘unexplained’ or ‘persistent’,” Dr Ow said. \n“If you notice constitutional symptoms (a group of symptoms that affect many body systems) like constantly feeling tired or fatigue, unexplained weight gain or weight loss, feeling bloated, constantly feeling full or having a poor appetite, it may not be a bad idea to get a medical assessment.” \nDr Look pointed out that many early cancers remain in the symptomatic-detectable stage for a long time before they become advanced. \nFor example, in a clinical study he did for his patients with stomach cancer, up to 30 per cent of the early cases remained in this stage for more than a year before they progressed to the advanced stage. When these patients saw Dr Look, they already had symptoms for up to a year. \nThe symptoms for stomach cancer may include indigestion, nausea, vomiting, upper abdominal pain and heartburn.\nUrging patients not to ignore their symptoms, no matter their age, Dr Look said: “The potential window for diagnosis and cure is therefore significant as long as we do not ignore our symptoms.” \nCurrently in remission, Ms Tan wished that she had been more aware of how to care for her health. Her advice to young people is to listen to their body and advocate for their own health, especially if there are suspicious symptoms.  \nBringing up the point that alarm bells may not ring for doctors in general because the prospect of cancer in a younger person was hardly thought of as common in the past, she said: “Do not neglect the early signs, and go beyond the basic check-ups even when doctors may dismiss you because you are a young adult.”\nLearn more about cancer at Our Tampines Hub from 10am to 8pm on Feb 17 and 18. The event is organised by the Singapore Cancer Society to celebrate its 60th anniversary in conjunction with its annual World Cancer Day Carnival.\nEligible members of the public can each get a pair of faecal immunochemical test kits to collect stool samples and book their screening appointments at the Singapore Cancer Society Clinic in Bishan.

            "Article Summary": "Members of Parliament from the Government Parliamentary Committee for Health has filed a motion to do more to tackle mental health.\nIt is to call for a whole-of-Singapore effort in advancing mental health and well-being.\nDr Wan Rizal Wan Zakariah from the committee explains why the team has put this up for when Parliament sits the week of Feb 5.\nHe talked about his personal experience of supporting his wife through her postnatal blues and the importance of having a support network.\nHis hopes are that mental health screenings will be the norm one day, and that people have strong links to a caring community with shared interests",
            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — When Dr Wan Rizal Wan Zakariah and his wife had their fourth child in 2017, he thought that he would be better prepared to walk his wife through the throes of postnatal blues.\n“You know, having a fourth child means you’re quite an ‘old bird’ already, lah,” the 46-year-old said, using a term that refers to someone who is well-seasoned. His wife is three years younger than him.\n“You know that your wife will go through postnatal depression probably, and you’re more or less geared up… you know how to help her out,” he continued.\nThe Member of Parliament (MP) for Jalan Besar Group Representation Constituency was speaking to TODAY on Friday (Feb 2) before Parliament sits next week. \nHer condition then had not been medically diagnosed, he added, but even with some experience and preparation, having their fourth child was an especially difficult period for the couple, because his wife’s postnatal blues lasted for six months — much longer than he had expected.\n“And for that whole duration, I think it was quite tough because she was always down. And as much support as I was giving her, I had three other children who also needed their mum.” Their four children are now aged 17, 14, 11 and seven.\n“Under pressure” to care for his wife and young children then, Dr Rizal expressed gratitude to close friends to whom he could confide and be heard.\nWhat helped the family through that period was having a community and strong support network, he remembered.\n“Although I had to really hold the ship together, I was not alone. I had my parents, I had my in-laws and everybody came in and they became a very strong support system, and that’s why I believe strongly in this.\n“If you really want to improve mental health in Singapore, it’s about getting that support network strong.”\nThis is why, together with four other MPs from the Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) for Health — Dr Tan Wu Meng, Mr Yip Hon Weng, Ms Mariam Jaafar, and Mr Edward Chia — he has filed a parliamentary motion to call for a whole-of-Singapore effort in advancing mental health and well-being.\n“The essence of the motion is a heartfelt call for unity in nurturing a society where mental well-being is a shared journey, emphasising compassion, understanding, and collective action for the holistic health of every Singaporean,” he said.\nOn why the team had filed the motion, Dr Rizal said that each committee member had their own areas of interest and collectively brought together a “broad kind of expertise”:\n“For me, it was mental health and… (Ms Mariam’s) in tune with the nuances of the youth, and mental health comes up quite high on the list. Dr Tan Wu Meng, he’s a doctor, so he’s seen his fair share of mental health issues within the community, too.”\n“But if you look across (the board), all of us really believe that mental health is something that is very pertinent… and it has always been an issue deep within our hearts,” he added.\nIn October last year, the Government launched the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy, which aims to build up the country’s mental health ecosystem to offer accessible clinical care to people who need it.\nEven though Dr Rizal believes that the national strategy is a good move “in the right direction”, strengthening the community element would be a key focus for the GPC for Health, because they are looking to build on the national plan.\n“I’m glad that we are all moving in the right direction... it’s all about just refining it. I think the key word I want to use for our motion is that we want to refine. It’s not about revamping a strategy,” he said.\nReferring to the 2012 Community Mental Health Masterplan and the 2007 National Mental Health Blueprint that came before the latest national strategy, Dr Rizal added: “We always, in a way, refresh and update (our approach) simply because of the way our community changes over time, and the nuances need to be adapted accordingly.\n“And for us (in the GPC), many of us have been speaking about this for the longest time, and I thought it was timely that the strategy came out and we are able to further the strategy’s plans.”\nDuring the interview, apart from talking about the motion the GPC had filed, Dr Rizal also spoke about his motivations for being a long-time advocate for mental health.\nRecounting the period when his wife was experiencing postnatal depression after they had their fourth child, Dr Rizal recalled two things they did when his wife was struggling: He taught his three older children to help support their mother, aside from relying on an external network of family and friends for support.\nDr Rizal told TODAY that what really got him interested in the sphere of mental health and well-being was when he was an officer in the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) during his National Service days.\nAttending to suicide calls as an SCDF officer was an “eye-opener” for him, and it made him more cognisant of mental health conditions and how people wanted to be heard.\nSince becoming a parliamentarian in 2020, he has spoken extensively about mental health and well-being, often defaulting to the acronym “LAST”, short for literacy, accessibility, screening and time-outs.\n“If someone were to fall, we know how to provide first aid for the cut, right? You wash, then you put some ointment, and maybe you put a plaster over it.\n“But what if your friend, someone close to you, has a mental health issue that you probably need first aid for and we don’t have that capability?”\nHow society is going to construct that first aid, is an area to delve deeper into, he said.\nSome key hurdles that remain in advancing mental health and well-being in Singapore include overcoming stigma associated with mental health illness, learning to provide support for individuals and their caregivers, and strengthening individuals’ support networks, he added.\nOn how Singapore can specifically “go further” in deepening its strategy, Dr Rizal offered some starting points. They include normalising mental health screenings and expanding one’s mental health networks to include a community with shared interests.\n“If we can equate physical health screening to mental health screening and we make it a norm, I think that would be my greatest dream come true,” he said.\nJust as physical health screenings tell of an ailment or condition, which then allows for directed solutions to be taken to treat it, Dr Rizal hopes that mental health screenings can offer people greater clarity on how they may better their mental health and well-being.\nBesides these, he also expressed his hopes for mental health time-outs to be normalised.\nHe suggested focusing on an added element of “spiritual health”, a topic that emerged in his conversations with the community and engagement sessions with young people.\nNoting that spiritual health was one of seven dimensions of wellness in well-being research, Dr Rizal spoke of the importance of having an “all-encompassing” approach to such healthcare.\nEmphasising that spirituality was not to be conflated with religious faith even if it could encompass it, he instead likened this aspect of spiritual health to having a “certain direction in life based on a certain set of principles” to help one stay on one’s path.\nOn strengthening one’s support network, he spoke of expanding this beyond one’s circle of family and friends to also include building a community that has shared interests.\n“The next frontier is really that: We need an empathetic community that understands mental health, that supports one another, and provides opportunities and platforms to share openly.\n“So one of the things we really feel strongly for is shared spaces — shared safe spaces — and I think it’s very important.”\nThis may be connecting with others through shared interests in gardening, sports, or the arts, he added.\nUltimately, his hope for the mental health landscape in Singapore is to create a community that is resilient, knowledgeable about mental health literacy and, finally, able to apply this knowledge to help one another.\n“And I think the idea is that for those who need help, they’re able to get help without stigma, without fear.”"

            "Article Body": "An expert from Bioskin sheds light on this common skin condition and its multifaceted causes.\nYou’ve likely encountered these common beliefs: “Only teenagers get acne”, “Popping pimples gets rid of them more quickly” or “Acne is caused by eating too much chocolate and greasy food”.\nThese notions often trivialise the complexities of acne and can be misleading, said Ms Chanel Tay, assistant training manager at Bioskin, an established beauty salon in Singapore. Acne, she explained, is primarily caused by factors such as excess oil production, clogged pores and bacteria.\n“While cleansing helps remove surface dirt and oil, acne can still occur due to factors like hormonal imbalances and genetics. Over-washing or harsh scrubbing can irritate the skin and exacerbate acne,” she added.\nContrary to popular belief, acne affects individuals of all ages, including adults. “Hormonal changes, stress, diet and genetics can all contribute to acne development beyond the teenage years,” shared Ms Tay. “Hormonal acne is linked to the overproduction of sebum (an oily substance in skin glands), which clogs pores. Though often unavoidable, hormonal acne can be treated to prevent future breakouts.”\nFor individuals genetically predisposed to acne, Ms Tay recommends taking a proactive approach to managing acne. This includes selecting non-comedogenic products that won't block pores or worsen breakouts, as well as scheduling regular facial treatments.\nAs for popping or squeezing pimples, Ms Tay cautioned that this may worsen inflammation, increase the risk of scarring and spread bacteria, leading to more breakouts. “It’s best to leave pimples alone and allow them to heal naturally or seek professional treatment,” she advised.\nWhen it comes to diet choices playing a role in acne development, Ms Tay said that chocolate has been unfairly blamed as a trigger for acne, but there is limited evidence linking chocolate consumption directly to acne.\nGreasy foods themselves are also not the main culprit behind acne breakouts. According to Ms Tay, these foods are often eaten together with high-carbohydrate meals, which can trigger acne by promoting inflammation and influencing hormone levels.\n\nConsuming simple carbohydrates like refined grains and sugars can cause a rapid spike in insulin levels. The increase in insulin prompts higher levels of androgen hormones and IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) in the bloodstream. Consequently, this hormonal surge accelerates skin cell growth and boosts sebum production, contributing to clogged pores and acne.\nMAKING INFORMED DECISIONS TO IMPROVE SKIN HEALTH\n\nFor acne sufferers seeking a comprehensive treatment programme, Ms Tay recommends Bioskin’s Skin Purifying Face Treatment, which prioritises advanced technologies and specialised products over traditional extraction methods to tackle acne.\n“Our non-invasive approach includes using ultrasonic exfoliation to clear debris from the skin and draw out excess oils, whiteheads and blackheads, followed by a high-frequency device to kill germs and bacteria that cause inflammation,” Ms Tay explained.\nThe key ingredient used in this 10-step treatment is professional-grade salicylic acid, which penetrates the skin to dissolve dead skin cells, regulate oil secretion and lighten blemishes.\nTo address acne concerns effectively, Ms Tay emphasised the importance of examining the factors that contribute to acne development. “While we cannot alter our genetics or hormone levels, we can manage certain lifestyle choices that influence acne breakouts,” she said. “This includes maintaining good hygiene practices and adopting a balanced diet.”\nIn addition, Ms Tay recommends establishing a comprehensive skincare routine that encompasses gentle cleansing, moisturising and the use of non-comedogenic acne treatments. Individuals should also prioritise adequate rest, regular exercise, proper hydration and effective stress management to boost overall skin health.\nNew customers can try Bioskin’s Skin Purifying Face Treatment at a special price of S$38* (before GST). Terms and conditions apply.\nIndividual results may vary."

            "Article Body": "In the age of artificial intelligence, the Singapore Institute of Technology is harnessing its potential to reshape education through a competency-based approach. \n“In the realm of education, artificial intelligence (AI) is not just a tool,” said Professor George Siemens, chief scientist of Southern New Hampshire University’s Human Systems – an organisation that builds resources to respond to the systemic impact of AI on learning and wellness. “It is a thinking partner, one that changes our cognition.” \nRecognised for his pioneering work on how technology influences education, Prof Siemens was speaking at the recent CBExchange APAC 2024 in Singapore. Organised by the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) in partnership with the Competency-Based Education Network, the conference gathered thought leaders to explore the evolving landscape of education in the digital age.\nIndeed, AI is not just transforming industries but also recalibrating the labour market and precipitating a shift in core competencies. This rapid evolution presents a challenge for the education sector in bridging the widening gap between the skills of today’s workforce and those required by the job market.\nThe solution, according to Prof Siemens, lies in embracing a new educational approach, one increasingly recognised as vital in our AI-driven era: Competency-based education.\nA NEW PARADIGM OF LEARNING \nIn competency-based education, mastering skills and knowledge isn’t just about what you know but how well you apply it. In today’s dynamic job market, characterised by rapid technological advancements, this educational framework proves both agile and responsive.\nAddressing a pressing concern in modern education, Prof Siemens underscored the challenge universities face in assessing the authenticity of student performance. “With AI’s ability to generate assignments, how do we accurately assess student capabilities?” he said.\nCompetency-based education offers a compelling solution by shifting the focus to practical skill application rather than mere acquisition. Within this framework, proficiency in utilising AI itself becomes a competency that students will have to master in order to achieve their learning goals effectively.\nMoreover, this educational approach is designed to align educational outcomes with the evolving demands of the job market. By leveraging AI’s capabilities, curriculum development can be tailored to match real-world workforce requirements. This backward-design methodology ensures that educational pathways directly address the skills gap, enhancing graduates’ employability.\nDuring her presentation at CBExchange APAC 2024, Associate Professor May Lim, assistant provost (Applied Learning) at SIT, shared how competency-based education and stackable micro-credentials revolutionise learning. “With the help of AI and big data, we can quickly gather industry insights, enabling educational institutions to refine their offerings to equip students with the relevant skills to meet tomorrow’s challenges,” she said.\nEMPOWERING ADULT LEARNERS THROUGH AI \nSIT spearheaded the competency-based education model last year with the launch of its Applied Computing degree programme. Alongside, it introduced stackable micro-credentials and recognition of prior learning as key components of its adult education offerings. \nAssoc Prof Lim said: “As a forward-looking university, it’s crucial that we embrace change and offer flexible and accessible education pathways. This is vital for adult learners juggling multiple commitments while pursuing further education.”\nThe integration of AI’s adaptive learning technologies provides opportunities for highly personalised education, allowing content delivery that can be adapted to each learner’s pace and preferences. It also broadens the spectrum of assessment methods while ensuring comprehensive feedback. Assoc Prof Lim explained: “AI tutors can transform the feedback process by offering multifaceted perspectives, unlike the traditional method that relies on a single source.” \nA unique challenge encountered by students pursuing stackable micro-credentials is the asynchronous nature of the lessons, which allows for self-paced learning. “While independent learning offers flexibility, we recognise the value of collaborative learning. This is where AI peers can come into play alongside human peers with different schedules. This can make the learning process more interactive and supportive while accommodating the hectic schedules of adult learners,” she elaborated. \nNAVIGATING ETHICAL FRONTIERS WITH INTEGRITY\nAs educators explore the vast potential of AI, ethical considerations remain paramount. Stressing the necessity for openness and clarity in AI-related processes, Assoc Prof Lim said: “Ensuring transparency in how data is utilised is fundamental for building trust between students and educational institutions.”\nExpanding on this ethical imperative, Prof Siemens added: “Every phase – from data collection and model building to deployment and assessment – demands meticulous attention to safety, equity and ethics. It is critical that technological advancements contribute to a learning environment that is both fair and secure.”\nLooking ahead, Prof Siemens envisions AI as a catalyst for deeper inquiry into the human condition. “We’re at a crossroads, questioning what it means to be human in a technology-driven world,” he mused. “The hope is that AI will guide us in asking the right questions about human identity – and in so doing, elevate our understanding and enrich the human experience.”   \nLearners who are keen to upskill themselves can discover the array of courses offered by the Singapore Institute of Technology."

            "Article Body": "Shopee aims to deliver a seamless and reliable experience from order placement to fulfilment. \nLast September, as the weather grew increasingly hazy, Mr Gerald Lim, a computer programmer, knew he had to act quickly to find a solution. \n“My child, who is sensitive to airborne particles, was struggling with persistent sniffles,” he explained. “I urgently needed an air purifier to improve indoor air quality, especially on days when the environment turned less favourable.” \nBrowsing the assortment of vouchers and promotions on the Shopee mobile app, Mr Lim discovered the guaranteed next-day delivery (NDD) option. “Thanks to the NDD service, the air purifier arrived at my doorstep the following day,” he said. \nMr Kel Jin Chua, director of Shopee Singapore, highlighted that the introduction of NDD last August reflects the company’s commitment to enhancing customer experience and meeting the growing demand for expedited delivery options. “Shopee is focused on delivering effective solutions for pressing needs, such as securing a last-minute gift or replacing a faulty mobile phone,” said Mr Chua.\nHOW NEXT-DAY DELIVERY WORKS\nSince the launch of the service, Shopee has been working with logistics partner, SPX Express, to ensure the swift delivery of orders when customers opt for NDD as their delivery method. At SPX, a round-the-clock process facilitating NDD begins in the late afternoon and continues till nightfall. During this time, drivers collect parcels from sellers and transport them to SPX’s sorting centres where they are sorted overnight by specialised machines. \nParcels are scanned at each stage of the journey for accurate record keeping. For instance, upon reaching the sorting centre, they undergo both weighing and scanning procedures.\nPost-sorting, parcels are grouped by delivery areas and matched with their respective delivery bag or pallet. Thereafter, they are moved to delivery hubs across Singapore. Drivers load parcels into vans and embark on their delivery routes by 8am. \nFrom meticulous sorting to the precise coordination of delivery routes, each step is designed to ensure the timely arrival of customers’ orders.\nCOLLECTION POINTS FOR CONVENIENCE\nIn addition to NDD, Shopee provides access to 2,000 collection points located throughout Singapore, including minimarts, mobile phone stores, opticians, lockers and shopping malls. This option is ideal for customers who anticipate being unavailable to receive their deliveries at home.\nStructured to prioritise ease, most Shopee users will be able to find a collection point within a five-minute walk from their home or workplace. The most popular collection points serve over 300 Shopee customers daily and the number is set to rise.      \n     \nMr Lim often uses the Shopee collection point at a nearby convenience store when buying small items. “Since I’m not always at home, picking up my purchases on my way back from work is really convenient,” he said.\nTo optimise his limited time at home on weekends, Mr Ravi Singh, a full-time national serviceman, purchases necessities like toiletries and household goods on Shopee once or twice a week.\nHe, too, has reaped benefits from using the Shopee collection point service: “Shipping costs quickly add up when I buy items from multiple sellers, so it helps that delivery to collection points is free.” \nMr Singh retrieves his parcels from the convenience store located beneath his block. “Not only is the process hassle-free, I also have peace of mind knowing that my purchases are securely stored at the shop,” he added.       \nRECEIVE YOUR 4.4 HAUL IN A JIFFY\nAt major shopping events such as the 4.4 sale, users can anticipate an expanding array of products eligible for NDD.\nAmid the bustling excitement, shoppers can rest assured that Shopee remains dedicated to delivering orders promptly. \nSaid Mr Chua: “At Shopee, we place shoppers at the heart of all we do. Based on feedback obtained through Shopee chat and emails, we consistently adapt our features and services to meet evolving needs and provide users with an enjoyable online shopping experience.”\nSelect Shopee’s guaranteed next-day delivery option when making a purchase and enjoy the platform’s exceptional service and convenience throughout your online shopping journey.\n "

            "Article Body": "The National STEM Championship showcases young innovators going beyond book smarts to pit their analytical, scientific and communication skills against one another.\nIt’s the time of the year again when secondary school students in Singapore dive into challenges that reveal how science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) impact our lives.\nFormerly known as the National Science Challenge, the National STEM Championship (NSTEMC) aims to highlight emerging technologies and spark a passion for STEM subjects among students and the wider public.\nIn addition to the usual quizzes and tasks, NSTEMC participants are thrust into real-world scenarios during Onsite Challenges, where they must devise innovative solutions within a tight timeframe.\nDr Wu Yan, principal scientist at the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), commended this year’s finalists for their demonstration of critical thinking and creativity. “They sought innovative approaches and drew from personal experiences to tackle problems, showcasing a remarkable ability to think outside the box.”\nSURPRISES AND SECOND CHANCES\nThe victors of this year’s NSTEMC were the students from Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) (ACS (I)). The first, second and third runners-up were the students from Raffles Institution (RI), Raffles Girls’ School (RGS) and Temasek Junior College (TJC) respectively. All the teams comprised 15-year-old Secondary Three students.\nAny one of the finalists could have won – or been eliminated – thanks to the competition’s hands-on interdisciplinary focus, which demanded quick thinking and resourcefulness.\nACS (I) member Emmanuel Soon recalled the team sacrificing weekends and after-school hours to develop a prototype for a solar dryer using limited materials. As team member Ken Yokota Soh revealed, they diligently pored over videos and challenges from past competitions.\nYet, unexpected twists, like the task of constructing ball-and-stick models of organic molecules from memory during the quarter finals, took them by surprise. “After the time was up, we had only built one model,” recounted team member Reyes Lee.\nTo secure a spot in the grand finals, the ACS (I) team relied on the Wildcard Round, a crucial second chance. Said team member Aiden Lim: “It opened our eyes to the scope of the challenge and drove us to produce our best work and expand our scientific knowledge.”\nRGS, too, got a shot at redemption during the Wildcard Round. Teammates Claire-Leia Ng and Janhvi (who goes by one name) made a nerve-wracking dash to complete numerous tasks and questions on topics spanning zoology to programming in under one hour.\nThe team’s elation upon learning of their advancement to the grand finals was palpable, as they realised that their efforts had finally borne fruit.\nCOMMUNICATING STEM TO A WIDER AUDIENCE\nThe NSTEMC placed a premium on strong collaborative and communication skills, ensuring that participants could convey their knowledge in easily understood presentations and responses.\nJudge Dr Aniq Ahsan, a scientist at the Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology at A*STAR and technical advisor to the National Climate Change Secretariat at the Prime Minister’s Office, enjoyed the creative team presentations, which included start-up pitches, commercials and skits. Another judge, Dr Li Jingmei, group leader of the Laboratory of Women’s Health and Genetics at A*STAR, appreciated how teams crafted compelling narratives to bring scientific concepts and equations to life – some even incorporated aspects of Singapore’s history.\nFellow judge Assistant Professor Yvonne Gao, Centre for Quantum Technologies at the National University of Singapore, agreed, noting the teams’ confidence and their ability to articulate strategies and scientific rationale.\nAPPLYING STEM PRINCIPLES TO THE REAL WORLD\nDuring an Onsite Challenge visit to the National Kidney Foundation, the teams had a firsthand look at how STEM advancements improve patients’ lives. “The teams demonstrated a keen interest in learning and actively engaged with the experts and facilities they visited,” said judge Dr Lee Song Choon, director of KidsSTOP, Events and Engagement, at Science Centre Singapore:\nIndeed, the RI team said that the championship has inspired them to pursue STEM careers aimed at improving future standards of medical care and welfare.\nAddison Ang expressed his fascination with medical technology, while Harry Zhong Zihe noted that the study of medicine is a meaningful pursuit. Linus Ong hopes to explore precision medicine – which creates targeted, personalised treatment based on a patient’s data – while Swaagat Bikash Saikia is keen to explore natural language processing to create data-driven models that can address global community challenges.\nJudge Dr Felix Lena Stephanie, senior lecturer at the Nanyang Technological University’s School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, said the annual NSTEMC is a celebration of innovation, creativity and collaboration among young minds.\n“Viewers should tune in, not just to see the impressive technical prowess on display, but to be inspired by our nation’s emerging STEM leaders.

            "Article Body": "Level up your confidence with compression wear and waist trainers that provide contouring solutions for women at every life stage.\nIn an age shaped by digital influences, the relentless pursuit of unrealistic body ideals fuelled by media exposure and societal norms has thrust an unnecessary weight on women.  \nIn an effort to democratise body shaping, Ms Jas Chua launched Lazywaist Co, a solutions-based shapewear company. “Shapewear can be harnessed as a tool of empowerment. This led us to create a line that is backed by science and can help women feel and look better in a safe manner,” said Ms Chua. \nMATERIAL MATTERS\nGuided by the principles of effectiveness, comfort and a personalised approach to body contouring, Ms Chua’s goal was to make shapewear accessible to women in all seasons of their lives. \nOne key factor that enhances the wearability and versatility of Lazywaist’s products is the meticulous selection of material. “Our compression shaping range featuring The Slim (high-waisted sculpting pants) and The Sculpt (an arm-shaping top) is crafted from the same medical-grade material used by South Korean plastic surgeons in post-liposuction compression wear,” she said. \nShe pointed out that numerous patients in South Korea who had undergone liposuction were required to wear compression garments continuously for a minimum of 72 hours. As such, it was imperative for the material to be moisture-wicking, comfortable and lightweight. \nSimilar attention to detail went into developing The Fix, a double-layered zipper shaper that targets the midsection.\n“The Fix is crafted from neoprene, a material commonly found in wetsuits. In addition to being soft and lightweight, neoprene naturally retains heat. Women who wish to enhance sweat production during a workout session can consider wearing the garment under their gym-wear,” said Ms Chua.  \nBeyond its functional qualities, shapewear can also feel luxurious. The Desire, a contouring underwear from the Lazywaist collection, touts intricate lace detailing, lending it a sumptuous finish. \nEFFECTIVE COMPRESSION WITHOUT DISCOMFORT\nCompression wear refers to snug, elastic clothing designed to compress and provide support to underlying tissues in the body and limbs. This concept is thought to mitigate the effects of gravity and promote improved posture and wound healing.\nSuch garments are widely used in sports to boost blood circulation and ease muscle swelling after workouts, and harnessed in medical therapy to address conditions such as varicose veins.\nLazywaist’s compression range offers compression levels that closely resemble those found in medical-grade compression wear. “Doctors typically prescribe compression wear with levels at 40mmHg and above while our products feature compression levels of 35mmHg. This slightly lower figure ensures comfort for daily wear while still providing nearly identical benefits,” explained Ms Chua.\nIllustrating her point, Ms Chua shared that The Slim is expected to provide double the compression compared to regular yoga pants.\nLazywaist’s compression and shapewear range is a favourite among air stewardesses, offering support during long periods of standing and helping them maintain a sleek physique in their fitted uniforms.\nThe Lazywaist collection has been put to the test by a diverse group of women, including four mum-influencers – Ms Mongchin Yeoh, Ms Cheryl Chin, Ms Melissa Koh and Ms Selina Ong – who shared their experience at the brand’s launch on Sep 19.\nFirst-time mothers Ms Yeoh and Ms Chin have discovered The Slim to be a valuable addition to their regimens.\nFor Ms Yeoh, it has become an essential companion on long-haul flights, ensuring improved lower body circulation. She reflected: “I’ve noticed a reduction in water retention and my body appears less bloated.” \nMeanwhile, Ms Chin has integrated The Slim into her fitness sessions, boosting compression during her gym and Pilates workouts. Additionally, it helps her achieve a more streamlined figure.\nPOSTPARTUM BODY SHAPING\nIt is important to align one’s shaping objectives with the right shapewear, especially when addressing a specific need such as postpartum body shaping. Ms Chua shared that the postpartum period is often regarded as “a golden phase of recovery”, characterised by pelvic expansion and “a more adaptable body state”, making postpartum binders beneficial in contouring and supporting the abdominal area. \nWhile waist training is a common practice in European countries, there are limited products designed to suit the Asian physique in the market, said Ms Chua.\nFor this reason, Lazywaist developed a waist training collection tailored for Asian body types, comprising The Fix and The Shape (a waist trainer with nine-steel boning). “The latter is ideal for new mothers, serving as a postpartum binder to gently sculpt the waistline by tucking in ‘tummy pouches’,” she explained.\nMs Yeoh shared that she paired The Shape with Lazynote, an in-house eight-week waist training programme with prescribed specific wear hours. “When used in concert, the regimen offered effective waist support. Just a few hours of daily wear made me feel like I was on my way to reclaiming my pre-pregnancy shape,” she said.\nA third-time mother, Ms Koh revealed that the Lazywaist range marked her introduction to waist trainers and compression wear. “The team encouraged me to progress at my own pace with Lazynote and I still managed to achieve pleasing results,” she said.\nTo round out a holistic postpartum shaping routine, women can incorporate The Slim into their regime – these sculpting pants can help manage postpartum swelling in the thighs, hips and calves due to their compression properties.\nIn support of new mothers, Lazywaist has curated a special postpartum bundle for full-body contouring.\nAnd to facilitate the breastfeeding experience, women can try the seamless and wire-free Love-me-Tender nursing bra. Engineered with comfort and convenience in mind, the bra features an ultra-soft breathable nylon-spandex blend and includes sewn-in padding, making washing hassle-free without the need to remove separate pads.\n“I’ve tried various nursing bras in the past but Love-me-Tender stands out as the most comfortable and cooling option. I appreciate how the bra provides support without underwire,” said Ms Koh. \nSHAPING GOALS ACROSS LIFE STAGES\nWomen of all life stages can benefit from wearing shapewear regularly or for special occasions. “The advantages include having better posture and enhanced confidence, resulting from a sleeker and more polished appearance,” said Ms Chua.\nMum-preneur Ms Ong, a co-founder of a luxury hair salon, is a fan of The Shape for its ability to refine her silhouette. She said: “I wear it daily and appreciate the posture and back support it provides, especially since I spend long hours on my feet in heels at work.”\nAcknowledging that unrealistic body standards can have detrimental effects on an individual’s self-image, Ms Chua believes that embracing yourself no matter your body type is the first step to feeling good. \n“Good shapewear can give you that extra boost by helping you fit better in clothes, but true beauty arises from finding contentment within yourself,” she said. \nTo meet your shaping objectives, browse the full Lazywaist shapewear range online.
