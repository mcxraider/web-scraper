            "Article Summary": "For the attempted rape of his step-daughter, a 41-year-old man was sentenced to jail and caning.\nHe also molested the girl in the bedroom where his other young children were present.\nThe victim was aged 11 to 14 during the period when these happened",
            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — A 41-year-old man was sentenced to six years and seven months’ jail and eight strokes of the cane on Wednesday (May 29) for the attempted rape and molestation of his step-daughter, then aged 11 or 12.\nThe man pleaded guilty to aggravated attempted rape of a person aged under 14, as well as outrage of modesty.\nBoth the offender and his victim cannot be named due to a court order to protect the victim’s identity.\nThe man's sentence was backdated to his date of arrest on May 18 last year.\nCourt documents showed that the man had been in a romantic relationship with the victim’s biological mother since 2004, and later moved in together with them and lived as a family.\nThe victim, who was between five and six years old then, treated the man like a father figure.\nThey moved houses multiple times over the years — in 2010, they moved in with the man’s parents in the Chua Chu Kang district and later moved to a rented bedroom of a flat in Geylang in 2013.\nThe man and the victim’s mother registered their marriage in 2015.\nThey have four other children born between 2005 and 2013.\nSometime between 2010 and 2011 at about 2am to 3am, when the rest of the family was asleep in the living room of their home, the man woke up the victim and took her to the kitchen toilet.\nHe did so knowing that the victim, who was aged between 11 and 12 at the time, was quiet in nature and would follow his instructions.\nThe man tried to have sex with her but failed to do so after multiple attempts. He then sexually abused her.\nIn September 2013, when the victim was 14 years old, the man struck again to molest her when they were in the bedroom.\nMost of the victim's step-siblings were watching television in the same room when it happened.\nThe victim’s mother was not there.\nIn April 2014, when the man was sent to jail for separate offences, the girl realised that the sexual acts committed by him were wrong and confided to her mother about what had happened.\nCourt documents did not specify the nature of the offences for which the man was jailed at this time.\nThe girl later ran away from home and said that she was too scared to go home because the man would soon be released from prison, court documents stated.\nThe victim’s mother filed a police report in May last year, on the advice of a social worker.\nThe man was arrested the same month.\nOn Wednesday, Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Daphne Lim sought a jail sentence of between seven years, three months and seven years, five months — together with nine strokes of the cane.\nShe told the court that the man had abused the trust and authority of being a father-figure to the victim and sexually exploited the victim.\n“The man had also brazenly molested the victim in the presence of his other young children, at her home, where she should have been the safest,” DPP Lim added.\nIn mitigation, defence counsel Michelle Tang from law firm Nakoorsha Law said that the man had pleaded guilty early, sparing the victim from more suffering of testifying in court if the case had gone to trial.\nMs Tang also said that the victim had since forgiven the man for what he did.\nDistrict Judge Koo Zhi Xuan said that the sentence imposed was proportionate to the man’s criminality.\n“It is a reminder that we live in a society that cannot tolerate any form of abuse against young and vulnerable victims, especially from someone they trust.”\nFor the attempted rape of a person under the age of 14, the man could have been jailed for between eight and 20 years and received at least 12 strokes of the cane.\nFor outrage of modesty, he could have been jailed for up to three years, fined, caned or been given any combination of such punishments."

            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — A man who set off a box containing 25 shots of fireworks near a block of flats in Yishun last month was ordered to pay a S$5,000 fine on Tuesday (May 28).\nNoor Azhar Abdul Abas, 40, pleaded guilty to discharging dangerous fireworks.\nThe incident took place at a grass patch near Block 644 Yishun Street 61 on April 9, the eve of Hari Raya Puasa, at about 10.40pm.\nAn eight-second clip of the incident posted by a resident was published on video-sharing platform TikTok, which showed the fireworks going off in the housing estate. The video has since been removed. \nNo injuries were reported.\nThe court heard that in March this year, Noor Azhar bought a box of containing 25 tubes of fireworks labelled “Happy Boom Shoot” from an unknown person in the Geylang area. \nHe planned to use them during the Hari Raya Puasa celebrations the following month.\nOn the eve of Hari Raya Puasa, he discharged the fireworks at the grass patch in Yishun, with the fireworks hitting about 10-storeys high and lasting for about two minutes. Court documents did not state if this grass patch was near Noor Azhar's home.\nDue to the commotion and spectacle caused by the discharge of the fireworks, members of the public became alarmed and called the police, who managed to trace Noor Azhar through surveillance cameras in the area.\nThe remains of the fireworks were then seized for analysis.\nTwo video clips of what happened around the Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats were played in court.\nOn Tuesday, Deputy Public Prosecutor Norman Yew sought a S$5,000 fine as punishment. He told the court that Noor Azhar’s actions had caused unnecessary alarm to residents, adding that there was an element of premeditation.\nDuring his mitigation plea, Noor Azhar said that he was deeply remorseful for his actions, which was “carried out without thinking”.\nUnder the Dangerous Fireworks Act, it is an offence to possess, sell, transport, deliver, distribute, import or discharge any dangerous fireworks in Singapore.\nFor his offence, Noor Azhar could have been jailed for up to two years or fined between S$2,000 and S$10,000, or both."

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — The State Coroner has reiterated the importance of safe sleeping practices for infants while giving an open verdict into the death of a seven-week-old boy who was found face down on a pillow.\nWhile State Coroner Adam Nakhoda said it could not be conclusively determined if the baby died from asphyxia or a natural cause of death, he emphasised the importance of safe sleeping arrangements.\nAn expert had previously highlighted that accidental suffocation of a sleeping infant was a preventable cause of sleep-related infant deaths.\nGuidelines include: Not placing loose items like pillows, blankets, beddings, toys or mattresses around or under a sleeping infant; allowing the infant to sleep alone in a baby cot; and using a firm mattress with a fitted bedsheet with no gaps between the mattress and cot rail.\nInfants should be placed on their backs when sleeping and not on their stomach or side until they are a year old. However, babies above four months old who can roll from their backs to their stomachs and back again can be allowed to remain in the sleeping positions they assume.\nThe baby boy was born on May 17, 2023, at KKH Women's and Children's Hospital to a couple who already had a five-year-old daughter and a one-year-old son.\nThe boy was pre-term at 35 weeks due to placental abruption. He weighed only 2.14kg and was transferred to the special care nursery and later neonatal intensive care unit.\nHe was discharged from KKH at two weeks of age.\nHis mother said he may have caught a cough from his brother in the week he went home but had no fever.\nThe baby was cared for primarily by his mother and was bottle-fed every two to three hours.\nInitially, the baby slept in a cot in the same room as his mother and older brother, who was a one-year-old toddler.\nHowever, as the baby woke up frequently to feed, this affected his brother's sleep.\nThe baby was then moved to sleep in another bedroom with his father. In this bedroom, there was an elevated bed and a mattress next to it on the floor.\nThe baby was first put to sleep on the bed, while his father slept on the mattress.\nHowever, the parents became concerned that the baby might fall off the bed and put him to sleep on the mattress instead, while his father slept on the bed.\nWhen the baby slept on the mattress, he was usually placed slightly on his side, with most of his back still on the mattress.\nHis head would be placed on a small pillow in a side-lying position, because milk tended to leak out of his mouth.\nHis head was tilted to the side because of his slight runny nose and congestion.\nThe parents would then cover the baby with a weighted bean bag to prevent him from moving while he slept.\nOn Jul 3, 2023 at about 10pm, the boy's father fed him milk and placed him in his usual sleeping position on the mattress. The baby was likely to be swaddled, the court heard.\nThe father then went to sleep on the bed next to the baby.\nAt about 5.30am the next morning, the father woke up and panicked when he realised the time.\nThis was because the baby should have woken at around 1am to feed, but he had not.\nThe father checked on the baby and saw him face down on the pillow, unresponsive. The weighted bean bag was still on the baby.\nThe father picked the infant up and tried to wake him but found that he was stiff and cold.\nThe man then woke his wife, who saw that the baby's face and lips were purplish.\nShe was trained in infant first aid and began to administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation to the baby while her husband called for an ambulance.\nParamedics at the scene estimated that the baby had likely died for some time. The child was pronounced dead later that morning.\nAn autopsy could not ascertain the final cause of death. Although asphyxia could not be totally excluded as a cause of death, it was also possible that the boy had died due to a natural disease process, the medical officer performing the autopsy found.\nPhotos taken of the scene showed that the mattress the baby slept on was a thin adult-sized mattress that appeared to be meant for a single bed.\nWhile a fitted sheet was placed on the mattress, it was clear it did not fit snugly as there were creases and ridges made by the loosely fitted sheet, the coroner said.\nThe mattress was placed against the elevated bed, with soft toys, small pillows and a packet of wet wipes placed on the mattress.\nThe pillow was rectangular with a depression in the middle, possibly caused by the weight of the baby's head.\nThe parents of the child did not raise any issues or concerns during the coroner's inquiry and the police did not suspect foul play.\nThe coroner said \"losing a child is always a devastating event, perhaps more so when the child is a very young infant that was otherwise thriving\".\nAlthough the boy had some medical issues at birth, he had overcome these and there was no evidence he had any other issues at the time of his death.\nThe coroner found that it was likely the baby had died before 5.30am when his father found him.\nWhile it was unclear how the baby ended up lying prone, it was possible that his nose and mouth were covered by the pillow, resulting in asphyxiation.\nThis could have resulted in the redness seen around the baby's nose and mouth and a small bruise on his nose. However, the coroner said these could also have been a result of the CPR.\nHe extended his condolences to the boy's parents on their tragic loss. CNA\nFor more reports like this, visit cna.asia."

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — A veteran doctor has been suspended for a year by the Singapore Medical Council (SMC) for professional misconduct, after a misdiagnosis in 2019 resulted in a teenage patient losing his testicle.\nDr Yeo Khee Hong, who has been a registered medical practitioner for about 42 years, first diagnosed the teenager with abdominal colic and later swelling and inflammation in his testicles, prescribing him stomach-related medicine and antibiotics.\nHowever, the boy's condition worsened despite repeated visits to Dr Yeo, until he had to undergo surgery to remove his testicle. His real condition was testicular torsion — a condition where the spermatic cord which provides blood flow to the testicle becomes twisted and cuts off blood supply.\nIf the boy had been referred for urgent care in time, he had an estimated 90.4 per cent to 97.2 per cent chance of salvaging his testis, according to the grounds of decision on the case, released on Monday (May 27).\nDr Yeo pleaded guilty to one charge of professional misconduct for failing to provide competent and appropriate care and or to exercise due care in the management of his patient.\nA second charge of failing to provide adequate information to the patient was taken into consideration for sentencing.\nThe boy was 15 or 16 when he consulted Dr Yeo at his clinic on March 22, 2019.\nHe told Dr Yeo that he felt pain in his left abdomen that had started from his left testis.\nHe also had increased bowel movement, with watery stools.\nDr Yeo examined the boy and found that his abdomen was soft and that there was no abnormal mass or torsion in his left testis.\nHe diagnosed the boy with abdominal colic and prescribed him stomach-related medicine.\nFive days later, the boy consulted Dr Yeo again and said he had swelling and pain in his left testis which felt worse when he sat or walked.\nDr Yeo examined the boy, finding his left testis enlarged and tender.\nHe diagnosed the boy with orchitis and epididymitis — swelling and inflammation — of the left testis. He prescribed antibiotics to the boy and ordered a full blood count and urine test for him to confirm his diagnosis.\nHowever, before arriving at his diagnosis, Dr Yeo did not consider the possibility of intermittent testicular torsion.\nHe excluded this and considered that orchitis and epididymitis was more probable. \nDr Yeo also did not refer the boy to a specialist or to the accident & emergency department of a hospital before excluding testicular torsion.\nThe next day, Dr Yeo told the boy's mother about the result of the blood test and said the likely cause of swelling was an infection. He asked that the boy continue his prescription of antibiotics.\nThe boy's condition did not improve. His father called Dr Yeo on April 1, 2019 saying his son was suffering severe pain.\nDr Yeo said the boy's condition was serious and asked him to be taken to an accident & emergency department urgently.\nThe boy went to a hospital where a scrotal ultrasound revealed left testicular torsion. \nHe was admitted to a surgical ward and underwent surgery to remove his left testis.\nThe SMC heard that a \"reasonable and competent doctor\" in Dr Yeo's position would have considered the possibility of intermittent testicular torsion at the consultation on March 27, 2019, and would not have excluded it as a differential diagnosis without first referring the patient to a specialist or an accident & emergency department of a hospital.\nThe applicable standard of care is to consider all acute scrotal pain as testicular torsion until proven otherwise.\nThe boy's father made a complaint to the SMC around July 2020, alleging that Dr Yeo was negligent in failing to diagnose and eliminate the risk of testicular torsion, resulting in the removal of his son's left testicle.\nDr Yeo responded to the SMC's notice of complaint and later sent an apology letter to the patient and his family.\nAccording to the grounds of decision, the patient's likely early testicular salvage rate would have been an estimated 90.4 per cent to 97.2 per cent if Dr Yeo had referred him to a specialist or the accident & emergency department of a hospital during the consultation on March 27, 2019.\nCounsel for the SMC, Mr Chia Voon Jiet, Ms Lee I-Lin and Ms Chin Dan Ting from Drew & Napier, said Dr Yeo's misconduct delayed the patient's diagnosis and treatment such that he lost a significant chance of salvaging his left testis.\nThe boy suffered not only physical pain but emotional and psychological distress from the loss. \nThe potential harm to the boy also includes fertility issues from losing a testis, said SMC's lawyers.\nDr Yeo, who was represented by Mr Christopher Chong and Ms Sharon Liu from Dentons Rodyk & Davidson, said he was \"deeply saddened\" by the patient's plight.\nHe accepted that he ought to be penalised for not referring the boy to an accident & emergency department on March 27, 2019.\nHowever, he said an urgent referral would not have guaranteed that the testis would be salvaged.\nCounsel for the SMC argued that Dr Yeo had acted negligently and that his treatment of the patient was not an appropriate management option.\n\"Despite the patient being at risk of testicular torsion and his clinical presentation and age being suggestive of testicular torsion, (Dr Yeo) was content to treat the patient with antibiotics, perform laboratory investigations, and to 'make the decision to refer only if the pain and swelling persisted in a few days and depending on the full blood count test results',\" said the lawyers.\nIn response, Dr Yeo said he had considered the possibility of testicular torsion, but his preferred preliminary diagnosis was orchitis and epididymitis in view of his physical examination of the patient.\nDr Yeo said his failure to inform the boy of the possibility of testicular torsion was \"a wrong judgment call\", but said it was \"out of good intention as he did not want to cause undue alarm to the patient\".\nHe accepted lapses on his part but said he had the boy's well-being and best interests in his mind, with no suggestion he was acting maliciously or recklessly.\nOn top of the 12-month suspension, Dr Yeo will also be censured. He will have to submit a written undertaking to the SMC that he will not engage in the conduct again or any similar conduct, and he will have to pay the costs and expenses of the proceedings including the costs incurred by SMC's lawyers.

The system was put on hold in 2020 as the government said it was looking at ways to make installation of the RFID tag easier. \nBased on current records, Mr Loke said there are about 70,000 Singapore-registered motor vehicles that have activated VEP tags. More than 200,000 motor vehicles have been registered but have not completed the process of installing and activating their VEP tags.\nThe RFID tags, which uniquely identify each vehicle, are non-transferrable.  \nMr Loke said the tags will be sent to vehicle owners for installation. “If previously, they had to come to Johor Bahru to get it fixed … now it will be sent to their address and they can fix it themselves according to the guidelines provided,” he said.\n“The system is ready and the registration commenced in 2019 but we had not enforced it for five years. If we don’t enforce it, the system is not being utilised,” he added.\nThe VEP will enable the government to track foreign vehicles that enter or leave the country, he said. “When they leave, if they have any summonses, they will have to settle them before they are allowed to leave.”\nCurrently, all foreign-registered cars entering Malaysia by road via Johor need to pay a levy.\nSingapore-registered vehicles are required to pay a road charge of RM20 for entering via the Woodlands Causeway and Tuas Second Link checkpoints, which are among the busiest in the world.\nMotorcycles are excluded from these charges. \nDuring the same press conference, Mr Loke said that the government intends to expand the VEP and Road Charge system to the Malaysia-Thailand border. \nMore information about the VEP can be accessed at vep.jpj.gov.my.

            "Article Summary": "British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has proposed that there be national service in the United Kingdom.\nThe aim is to foster a shared sense of purpose among young people and renew national pride.\nThe plan is for 18-year-olds to take up the compulsory service and choose between year-long military training or volunteering in community roles .\nPolitical observers said that the UK government needs to minimise organisational inefficiencies to the best of their capabilities for the plan to work.\nCritics in the UK, including opposition political party members, have labelled the plan as impractical and fiscally irresponsible",
            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — In the hope of fostering a “shared sense of purpose among our young people” and \"a renewed sense of pride in our country\", British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is planning to introduce a national service scheme for 18-year-olds in the United Kingdom. \nUnder the scheme, teenagers of age there are expected to hone some skills and contribute to their community — by taking part in a \"competitive, full-time military commission\" or volunteering on weekends in roles within the community. \nCommenting on the news, political and defence experts in Singapore said that the devil is in the details for Mr Sunak's vision because if the scheme is poorly organised, it could backfire. \nAs for how the UK’s Opposition (the Labour Party) and the public have reacted to the news so far, they have been saying that it is important to delve into why Mr Sunak had chosen national service as a means of fostering national unity. \nAs it stands, public disapproval could make the plan “incredibly hard” to implement, one researcher here said.\nMost of the details have not been announced yet, but if Mr Sunak’s party (the Conservative Party) wins the general election in the UK this July, a pilot scheme is set to start in September 2025. \nTODAY takes a look at what Mr Sunak has said so far about the new national service model, whether it will be effective in promoting national unity, and what the UK government needs to consider before introducing it. \nMr Sunak announced last Wednesday (May 22) that the UK will be having a general election on July 4.\nThe national service plan was his Conservative Party's first major policy proposal and a campaign promise should it win the election.\nThe prime minister said that this would help unite society in an “increasingly uncertain world” and that Britain faces a future that’s “more dangerous” and “more divided” today. \n“There's no doubt our democratic values are under threat,” he added, calling it \"a bold new model of national service for 18-year-olds\".\nFellow party member James Cleverly who is Secretary of State for the Home Department told BBC news channel that the scheme would \"address the fragmentation in society\".\n\"Too many young people are living in their own bubble, whether that's a digital bubble or a social bubble.\n\"We want to get back to a situation where young people are mixing with people — in different areas, different economic groups, different religions — to try and find a way of addressing the kind of fragmentation that we see too much of,\" Mr Cleverly was quoted as saying.\nAlthough Mr Sunak’s proposal entails a mandatory national service, it is not considered a conscription where people are compelled by law to join the armed services such as in Singapore.  \nHowever, when a person turns 18, they will be required by law to choose either to enrol in a year-long military training scheme or volunteer in a community programme for one weekend a month or 25 days a year. \nNo one will be thrown into prison for not taking part, but there will be non-criminal sanctions for those who refuse, British media reports said.\nSome of these roles for the youth would include delivering prescriptions and food to the sick or in search-and-rescue work.\nMr Sunak said: “This ambition benefits our country and our young people alike. Just look at Sweden, where 80 per cent of young people who completed national service say they recommend it to their friends.” \nAs for the punishment for not taking up this national service, Mr Cleverly told British news channel Sky News: “There's going to be no criminal sanctions. No one’s going to jail over this.”\nDespite the hopeful messaging, political watchers said that there will be factors that will determine if the scheme will achieve what it sets out to do.\nOne observer in Singapore said that the plan could be a “double-edged sword” if it is not done efficiently. \nDr Bernard Loo, a senior fellow at the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies in Singapore's S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS), told TODAY: “I view (the national service scheme) as a potential positive in giving people a renewed sense of pride in their country. \n“But here’s the thing: What if all you do is expose these young people to see just how badly run these various services are?” \nFor example, someone who decides to volunteer as a medicine deliverer for the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK realises that it takes hours for the prescriptions to be ready. \n“This is just a hypothetical scenario. If anything, (such a situation) could backfire and generate a new wave of cynicism. I'd say if (the UK) wanted it to work, if it wanted to develop these positive emotions in the youth, the devil is in the details. \n“It should ensure minimal organisational inefficiencies so that the young people have a positive experience and come away feeling they've not wasted their time.” \nMr Ho Shu Huang, who is co-editor of the book National Service in Singapore, said that it is important to note that Mr Sunak’s proposal encompassed roles that serve the community, not just in the military service. \nIn Singapore, National Service is a mandatory conscription for young men who have reached 18 years old and are citizens or permanent residents.\nMr Ho, who specialises in research of the military as an academic, said: “Most Singaporeans might associate national service with (military duties) since that is how we understand it. But that will not be the case under Sunak's proposal.\n“As such, there is arguably some merit in his argument that there needs to be a shared sense of purpose and pride in the country by ‘serving’ it at the ‘national’ level in the broadest of terms.”\nHowever, Mr Ho said that he is unclear why Mr Sunak made the proposal when, just two days before the announcement, the UK’s defence minister had declared that the government had no plans for national service in “any form” because it would do more harm than good.\n“So it's really unclear what (Mr Sunak) stands to gain unless it's to appeal to older voters who feel that the youth need to be better disciplined or to show there is a way to make the UK ‘great again’, to borrow that phrase used by former American president Donald Trump (in his campaign).” \nDr Leong Chan-Hoong, a senior fellow for social cohesion research at RSIS, said that for the policy to be legitimate, it would be best for the UK to ensure conditions are the same for everyone rather than giving people the option to choose.\n\"If (Mr Sunak) really wants this model for nation-building, it should either be completely focused on law enforcement or community service — not a combination of both. \n\"Conscription, by definition, is in a law enforcement or defence military environment. You don't infuse that with community service,\" he added, pointing out that successful models of conscription are based on three fundamental principles, namely national security, universality and equity.\nAsked what would be viable alternatives, Dr Leong said that the UK could consider looking into drafting housing and education policies that address societal fragmentation, allowing more opportunities for people of diverse backgrounds to mingle.\nLikewise, Dr Felix Tan, an independent political observer here who lectures on international relations, said that Mr Sunak’s suggestion was “rather strange” if the mission is to build a sense of national pride in the country. \nHe explained that compulsory national service such as that in Israel, Singapore and South Korea is perhaps more for strategic and national security purposes and not predicated on developing nationalism. \n“In others, such as Malaysia’s example, it is very limited and it still did not bring about national pride. So, such ideals are not always practical and realistic.”\nMalaysia's National Service programme was introduced in 2004 as a three-month training programme for 18-year-olds selected at random to foster national unity, instil discipline and promote patriotism among young Malaysians.\nHowever, it was suspended in 2015 due to budget constraints and concerns about its effectiveness. In 2018, it was permanently abolished by the new administration. \nBefore Mr Sunak’s announcement over the weekend, other countries such as Denmark, France, Norway and Sweden had recently reintroduced national service.\nThe British prime minister's proposal, though, has faced significant criticism so far. \nFormer military leaders have called the plan \"bonkers\" and \"electoral opportunism\", arguing that it would deplete the defence budget and impose unrealistic demands on the armed forces. \nThe Labour Party's member of parliament Rachel Reeves said that the plan was “an expensive gimmick”. \n“The Conservatives are making pledges without any idea where the money is going to come from. That is deeply irresponsible.”  \nIn that same vein, former defence secretary Michael Portillo expressed concerns about the proposal's financial implications and lack of thorough planning, suggesting that it may damage the Conservative Party's reputation for fiscal responsibility.\nCitizens interviewed by the media have expressed a range of views. Some found that the requirement's enforceability made it feel like a “punishment” and that compulsory volunteering was “contradictory”.\nOn the other hand, there were those who saw it as a good opportunity for the young to help with social causes and “do more” for the community.

            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — A boy promised his ex-girlfriend that he would delete intimate photos and videos of her, but later decided to upload them onto a file-sharing website and sell them.\nOn Monday (May 27), the boy, now 18 years old, was convicted of two counts of distributing intimate images and recordings of the girl, who is now 16, without consent.\nHe also pleaded guilty to a charge of rape and sexual penetration of a minor.\nSeveral other charges relating to voluntarily causing hurt using a dangerous weapon, committing mischief, cheating and dishonestly inducing a delivery of property, and posting advertisements to sell tobacco products were also admitted.\nAnother 16 charges of similar nature will be taken into consideration during the sentencing.\nThe teenager and his victims cannot be named due to a court order to protect the victims’ identities.\nThe boy and his victim, who were schoolmates, were in a brief relationship in 2019. They then broke up but remained friends.\nSometime in June 2021, the victim sent him 23 intimate images of herself via WhatsApp and told him to delete them afterwards.\nThe boy told her that he would, but then reneged on the agreement.\nThe next day, the victim sent another 20 intimate pictures and videos to another boy, and similarly told him to delete them after viewing.\nShe was unaware that both boys were together at the time.  \nThe first boy forwarded the second set of images and videos from the second boy’s mobile phone to his own.\nIn early August 2021, the offender posted advertisements of the victim’s images and videos on online forum Reddit.\nHe also uploaded them to a file-hosting website called Mega and created sharing links.\nCourt documents stated that he had distributed them on 77 occasions between Aug 15, 2021 and Jan 20, 2022.\nInterested buyers would contact the offender though Telegram application and would then transfer money to his PayPal or bank account, with amounts ranging from S$15 to S$120.\nIn total, he earned about S$3,050 from the transactions.\nOn Jan 25, 2022, the victim was alerted by another of the offender's ex-girlfriends that her images and recordings had been posted for sale online.\nThe victim filed a police report that same day.\nThe offender's other ex-girlfriend was also another of his victims, who had her intimate images and recordings distributed to others without her knowledge.\nThe boy was later arrested.\nThe court heard on Monday that the offender had committed other sexual offences following these episodes.\nIn December 2022, he had sex at home with a then 14-year-old girl who was in Secondary 2.\nOn March 2023, he had sex with a then 13-year-old girl during a drinking party, also at his home. Later, the victim made a police report against him, stating that she had been raped.\nOther offences related to voluntarily causing hurt using a dangerous weapon, mischief, cheating and dishonestly inducing a delivery of property, and posting advertisements to sell tobacco products were also heard in court.\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Tung Shou Pin asked the court to call for a reformative training suitability report, saying that the offender was “unrepentant”, and that the 24 charges he faced were of serious nature.\nHe had also frequently reoffended while on bail.\nIn mitigation, defence counsel Edwin Ho from the Public Defender’s Office asked the court to call for a probation suitability report, saying that the teenager had committed the offences out of “youthful folly”.\nDistrict Judge Carol Ling called for suitability reports for reformative training as well as probation.\nReformative training is a regimented rehabilitation programme for offenders under 21 who commit relatively serious crimes, while probation is usually offered to first-time offenders between the ages of 16 and 21 and does not result in a criminal record.\nThe teenager will be sentenced on June 28."

            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — Imagine a Build-to-Order (BTO) flat with a contiguous living and bedroom space — beamless and not separated by walls.\nThis is a new open-concept layout that the Housing and Development Board (HDB) will be offering as part of a trial, starting with a BTO project in the Kallang-Whampoa area that will be launched for sale in October. \nThe project will have 310 units of three-room and four-room flats, and buyers will have the option of choosing the new open-concept layout when they are invited to book a flat. \nCalled the White Flat layout, it is aimed at giving home owners the flexibility to configure their spaces.\nBecause such flats will not have internal walls partitioning the living and bedroom spaces, they offer buyers a \"white canvas\" to design the flat according to their needs and preferences, HDB said on Monday (May 27) after the initiative was announced by National Development Minister Desmond Lee at a pre-university seminar.\n\"This will appeal to young home owners who may prefer an open-concept home or carving out the spaces within their home using furnishing ideas,\" HDB added.\n\"The White Flat pilot will also provide home owners the option to install walls in future to meet their needs at different life stages.\"\nThere will be no visible beams between the living and bedroom spaces, as the structural columns are rotated and tucked to the edges of the unit, said HDB.\nIt added that the omission of inner partition walls will be \"factored into the pricing of the White Flats\", which is still being finalised.\nThose who do not opt for the White Flat layout will receive the standard layout with walls.\nIn response to changing preferences, HDB has over the years made adjustments to flat layouts that would give home buyers greater choice and flexibility in how they want to use and design the space.\nFor instance, all new BTO projects since 2018 come with an open kitchen concept where the layout permits.\nIn October 2022, HDB announced that a BTO project in Tengah would feature \"beamless\" flats that provide more headroom. It would also give home owners more flexibility to configure layouts without having to take into account the position of ceiling beams.\nFlat types have also evolved over the decades to keep up with changing demographics.\nHDB noted, for instance, that since the 2000s, windows of the living room and bedrooms were reoriented along the facade of the buildings for external views instead of into the corridors. This provides greater privacy as well.\nThe common bathroom has also been relocated from within the kitchen to be nearer to the common bedrooms, and the service yard is now separated from the kitchen with a door.\n\"Moving forward, HDB will continue to refine our flat offerings and building designs to keep in step with Singaporeans’ aspirations and lifestyle needs,\" it added.\nThe option of a White Flat would benefit those who plan on designing custom layouts for their home, allowing them to save on hacking costs, said ERA Singapore's key executive officer Eugene Lim.\n“A three-room flat of approximately 700 sq ft could cater to the needs of a couple without children, giving them the versatility to support their lifestyle. They may want a dedicated work or exercise space, a walk-in wardrobe or a larger living area for hosting,\" he noted.\n\"Similarly, a 1,000 sq ft four-room flat offers families with children the option of a larger play area or a joint bedroom with them.”\nA potential drawback, however, is that home owners may find it more difficult to sell their units because buyers may have different layout preferences. \nThe price difference between regular flats and those with a White Flat layout may also not be significant, said Ms Christine Sun, chief researcher and strategist of OrangeTee Group.\n\"This is because about half of the layout is the same, such as the kitchen, bathrooms, structural walls and main piping, where most of the costs are involved,\" she explained.\n\"The main difference lies in the non-structural or partition walls, which are not as expensive.\" CNA"

            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — A Nanyang Technological University (NTU) student group is protesting against a S$60 million corporate laboratory for low-carbon solutions that NTU has launched with oil and gas giant ExxonMobil. \nThe group, called NTUDivest, is a student-led movement that advocates for the university to cut its investments in fossil fuel companies. \nIt is part of the Singapore-wide Students for a Fossil Free Future (S4F), a group that campaigns against the oil and gas industry's alleged influence over the country's education system. \nThe laboratory — a partnership between ExxonMobil, NTU, the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*Star) and the National Research Foundation — was launched by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat on April 26.\nIn a joint statement by the four bodies, it was said that the lab will \"develop solutions that would help lower carbon emissions, contribute to resource efficiency, and help build a more sustainable future\".\nNTUDivest, however, has labelled the lab a \"greenwashing project\".\nIn an Instagram post on May 12, NTUDivest called the partnership \"highly concerning\", given ExxonMobil's poor environmental track record, which includes walking away from a much-publicised investment in algae biofuels and blocking investors' climate proposals. \nIn its post, NTUDivest wrote: \"From climate breakdown to toxic environmental pollution, ExxonMobil is no stranger to downplaying their effects.\" \nIt added that the student group is \"extremely doubtful that funding of Singapore's clean energy transition should be so heavily funded and influenced by one of the most notorious mega oil companies\".\nIn an emailed response on Sunday (May 26) to TODAY's queries, NTUDivest said that it was protesting to \"ensure that the outcome of this expensive partnership creates positive social and environmental benefits, and (is) not a greenwashing project\".\nIn an emailed response to TODAY last week, NTU stated that the new lab is \"an important platform bringing together researchers from academia and industry to translate knowledge into solutions that will benefit society by supporting the green energy transition and other areas of sustainability\".\n\"Working to create low-carbon solutions with industrial partners is exactly the sort of approach that is envisaged in NTU’s 2025 strategic plan,\" the university added.\nIt also said that the lab will \"determine its approach to assessing the impact of new technologies as its research programmes take shape\".\nSeparately, ExxonMobil told TODAY last week that its role in the lab was to contribute towards the adoption of new technologies by the industry.\n\"To support growing populations and rising standards of living, global demand for energy and products for modern living is projected to increase, and governments and industry will have to find ways to meet that demand,\" it added. \n\"An energy transition is underway, but it is not yet happening at the scale or on the timetable required to achieve society’s net-zero ambitions.\"\nThus, the company added that it has taken on an \"all-of-the-above-approach\" mindset, which includes meeting global energy demands while finding solutions for the energy transition through collaboration.\nA*Star told TODAY that its mission is to \"accelerate the translation of research into practical solutions\" and \"to help our partners track and reduce their carbon emissions\".\nIn its email to TODAY, NTUDivest's spokesperson Terese Teoh said that the students are not convinced by the statements put out by NTU and Exxon.\n\"Without evidence, and given past records, we doubt there is a genuine intention to do something for the climate. So we do not buy into what they are saying at all.\n\"Overall, they still have not answered any of our questions, so we continue to firmly believe that this project and such as collaborations are greenwashing efforts that endanger our collective futures,\" Ms Teoh added.\nThe group has called for more student involvement in the partnership and greater transparency on the new technologies and how they align with Singapore’s net zero transition plan to lower carbon emissions.\nMs Teoh added that the group will \"continue to be a watchdog on the school's greenwashing\".\n\"We will continue to publicly call it out. We will continue to make ourselves heard, to amplify our message that such dubious partnerships are untenable, and as students and stakeholders in this university, we will not stand for it.\""

            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — Construction work for the new Turf City MRT Station on the Cross Island Line (CRL) is set to start in the third quarter of this year, said the Land Transport Authority (LTA) on Monday (May 27).\nThe underground station will be located along Turf Club Road, near the former grandstand.\nTurf City MRT Station is one of six new stations forming Phase 2 of the CRL, which is set to start passenger service in 2032.\nLast Thursday, it was announced that about 15,000 to 20,000 public and private homes are planned for a new housing estate at Turf City in Bukit Timah over the next 20 to 30 years. \nThis is the first time in almost 40 years that public housing has been planned in Bukit Timah, said National Development Minister Desmond Lee.\nThe S$530 million contract to design and construct Turf City Station — which is a working name — and tunnels has been awarded to a joint venture between Shanghai Tunnel Engineering Co (Singapore) and Obayashi Corporation.\nLTA said the two companies have established track records in Singapore's rail projects. The joint venture had earlier been awarded the contract for the design and construction of the bored tunnel between Fairways Drive and Sin Ming Walk in December 2022.\nShanghai Tunnel Engineering Co (Singapore) is in the final stages of completing Katong Park and Bayshore MRT Stations on the Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL). It has also completed the construction of Shenton Way Station.\nObayashi Corporation previously constructed the North-East Line Dhoby Ghaut Station.\nThe construction works for Turf City MRT Station are expected to be challenging due to varying soil conditions in the area, particularly the harder ground conditions of the Bukit Timah granite formation which requires the use of specialised techniques to carry out excavation works safely.\nBefore starting excavation and construction works for the station structure, earth retaining and stabilising structures will be installed to ensure safety and ground stability.\n\"LTA and the contractors will monitor works closely and implement necessary mitigation measures to ensure safe construction with minimal impact to nearby stakeholders and infrastructure,\" said the authority.\nIt had earlier conducted an environmental impact assessment for the works near Eng Neo Forest. Nature groups were engaged to identify the flora and fauna in the area and to develop mitigation measures to minimise environmental impact.\nThese measures include setting up barriers along the roadside to prevent animals from going onto the road and to guide them towards other forest patches.\nRoad calming measures, such as speed bumps and speed limit signs, will be put up on the construction site access roads during the works to remind drivers to slow down and look out for animals.\n\"LTA will continue to engage nature groups and other stakeholders to keep them informed about the construction progress and mitigation measures, which have been put in place as part of the Environmental Monitoring and Management Plan,\" said the authority.\nThe CRL is Singapore's eighth MRT line, linking areas such as Jurong Lake District, Punggol Digital District and the Changi region, LTA said. Almost half of the stations will be interchanges with other rail lines.\nThe fully underground CRL will be constructed in three phases. Phase 1 was announced in 2019 and comprises 12 stations, with construction work expected to be completed by 2030.\nPhase 2, announced in September 2022, comprises six stations. Engineering studies for Phase 3 are ongoing and more details will be announced when the studies are completed, said LTA. CNA\nFor more reports like this, visit cna.asia."

            "Article Summary": "The US Justice Department filed a lawsuit against Ticketmaster and parent company Live Nation on May 24.\nIt seeks to break up Live Nation's dominance on the US concert and ticketing industry, describing the entertainment giant as a \"monopoly\".\nThe US government also alleged in the lawsuit that the company has anti-competition practices that came at a cost to concert-goers.\nTODAY looks into the lawsuit, allegations and how this might gave an impact on Singapore",
            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — In hopes of breaking up its alleged monopoly on the live concert industry in the United States, the country's Justice Department has filed a lawsuit against Ticketmaster and parent company Live Nation.\nThe 128-page antitrust lawsuit was joined by 29 US state and district attorneys general on Thursday (May 23), alleging that Live Nation and Ticketmaster used anti-competitive practices that have stifled the concert and ticketing industry.\nThe US government alleges that the anti-competitive practices have resulted in concert-goers facing high ticket prices and has prohibited innovation and competition.\nThrough the lawsuit, the US hopes that Live Nation will be ordered to divest \"at minimum\" Ticketmaster and cease any anti-competition behaviour.\nUS lawmakers have long accused Live Nation of engaging in such practices. Early last year, a congressional hearing was held on issues that fans faced while trying to buy tickets for pop singer Taylor Swift's The Eras Tour. Fans in Singapore also encountered similar problems.\nIn response to the civil suit on Thursday, Mr Dan Wall, executive vice-president of corporate and regulatory affairs at Live Nation, said that the lawsuit does not address problems in the concert and ticketing industry, and wrongfully targets Live Nation and Ticketmaster.\n\"It ignores everything that is actually responsible for higher ticket prices, from rising production costs, to artist popularity, to 24/7 online ticket scalping that reveals the public’s willingness to pay far more than primary ticket prices,\" Mr Wall wrote in a blog on the company's website.\nHe added that the lawsuit is \"anti-business\".\nDoes Live Nation own a monopoly, and how will this lawsuit affect Singapore's ticketing and concert scheme? \nLive Nation is essentially a one-stop shop for live entertainment — it provides promotional services, has ticketing services through Ticketmaster and owns several performance venues.\nThe US government has accused Live Nation of dominating the industry through what IT called a \"self-reinforcing 'flywheel'\".\nIf venues did not use Ticketmaster's services, they risked losing access to Live Nation-managed performances and tours — which can be a costly mistake.\nCelebrities such as rapper Post Malone have had their concerts produced by Live Nation, while pop stars Taylor Swift and Beyonce have had their sold-out tours promoted by the entertainment giant.\nIt is not just the venues — the complaint alleged that performers also had to use Live Nation's promotional services or they would not be able to perform at their venues.\nThis ecosystem allegedly made it increasingly expensive for industry competitors. And with a lack of competition, the US claimed that Ticketmaster had no incentive to invest into its systems.\nLacking competition also means that Live Nation could charge consumers several fees — which the lawsuit called \"Ticketmaster Tax\" — such as service fees, facility fees, payment processing fees and more. \n\"These strategies are part of a deliberate and defensive series of actions and decisions designed to lock up venues, lock out competitors, and hold the industry hostage from innovation and evolution,\" the US said in its lawsuit.\nIn 2010, the US Department of Justice approved a merger of Live Nation and Ticketmaster but with several conditions to ensure that the conglomerate would not act anti-competitively.\nThe antitrust decree was to ensure that Live Nation could not retaliate against a venue for using another ticketing service besides Ticketmaster, among other things.\nAfter the merger, Live Nation grew to become, in its own words, the \"largest live entertainment company in the world\".\nIt was accused of anti-competitive behaviour in 2019 by the US Justice Department, but it reached a settlement that was not disclosed.\nIn the latest lawsuit, it was stated that Live Nation manages more than 400 musical artists and controls 265 concert venues in North America, including more than 60 of the top 100 amphitheatres in the US.\nThrough Ticketmaster, it controls about 80 per cent of major concert venues' ticketing for concerts.\nLive Nation reported on May 3 that revenue rose 21 per cent to US$3.8 billion (S$5.13 billion) for the first quarter ended March 31 this year. This was well above earlier estimates of US$3.26 billion.\nEven though facts and figures such as these have spurred US legislators to describe the entertainment giant as an monopoly, it disagrees.\nMr Wall of Live Nation said on Thursday that it does not derive its profits from \"monopoly pricing\", stating that the company's service charges are no higher than other ticketing sites such as SeatGeek and AXS.\n\"In fact, when Ticketmaster loses a venue to SeatGeek, service charges usually go up substantially,\" Mr Wall added.\n\"And even accounting for sponsorship, an advertising business that helps keep ticket prices down, Live Nation’s overall net profit margin is at the low end of profitable S&P 500 companies.\"\nThe S&P 500 is a list of the country's top 500 companies.\nDepending on the outcome of the US Department of Justice lawsuit, concert-goers here could be affected.\nIf the outcome resulted in greater industry competition, this could pressure Ticketmaster to charge less for its services, which could mean that performing artistes are in a position to charge lower ticket prices for concert-goers.\nDr Hannah Chang, an associate professor of marketing at the Singapore Management University, said that should the lawsuit result in the need for concerts to engage several ticketing platforms, it might be more complicated for concert-goers to buy tickets.\nThis could also hurt artistes.\n\"Such issues are likely to be limited for megastars like Taylor Swift or Jay Chou where their fans will find a way (to buy their tickets),\" she added.\n\"For others — and particularly for emerging artistes — there may be benefits to being able to reach global audiences through one single platform, rather than through a mixture of platforms.\n\"For instance, if each concert uses a different platform, ticketing processes across languages and currencies are likely to be harder to standardise.\"\nThe impact of the lawsuit might be limited here though — Live Nation's hold on the Singapore concert industry is arguably smaller than in the US.\nFor one thing, it does not own any venue in Singapore, unlike in the US.\nWhile it is unclear if Ticketmaster has exclusive rights to provide its services at any venues, it does not have exclusivity for Singapore's National Stadium and Indoor Stadium, which have capacities of 55,000 and 12,000 respectively.\nA 2019 press release stated that it is one of three ticketing agents allowed to operate at the locations. The other two ticketing agents are Sistic and Australia's Ticketek.\nUltimately, the impact will depend on the lawsuit's outcome — which could take years."

            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — A domestic worker who was employed to take care of an 88-year-old woman stole the elder's ATM card to withdraw more than S$28,000 in cash.\nOn Thursday (May 23), Thae Thae Mar, a 34-year-old worker from Myanmar, was sentenced to six months' jail for her offences, which took place in February this year.\nShe pleaded guilty to a charge of theft, with another similar charge being taken into consideration during the sentencing.\nHer sentence was backdated to May 2 when she was first arrested and remanded.\nAt the time of the offence, Mar was employed as a domestic worker for Madam Hoo Siew Keng, who was living with her son and a tenant.\nShe was hired in early 2022 and her main duties were to take care of Mdm Hoo and the household chores.\nCourt documents showed that sometime in end January this year, Mar accompanied the victim to the market and, on several occasions, saw her keying in her personal identification number (PIN) at the automated teller machine (ATM) to withdraw money.\nMar, who was in need of money due to financial difficulties, remembered the PIN and decided she would steal Mdm Hoo's ATM card to get some money.\nOn Feb 3, while the older woman was washing her face at home, Mar took the ATM card from Mdm Hoo's wallet and went to an ATM located at Bukit Timah Market and Food Centre.\nShe withdrew cash totalling S$1,500 and remitted the money to her family members in Myanmar.\nShe then put back the stolen card in the wallet when she returned home.\nOn Feb 25, Mar told the victim’s daughter, Ms Lam Kwai Fern, that she had to return to Myanmar urgently, saying that her mother was shot by police officers there, and that she would not be returning to Singapore.\nMs Lam’s brother then booked a flight ticket and Mar left on Feb 26. At this point, the theft had not been discovered.\nFive days later, Ms Lam discovered that between Feb 3 and Feb 26, there were 36 unauthorised cash withdrawals amounting to S$28,760 from the joint bank account she held with her mother.\nShe then made an online police report against Mar.\nThe court heard that Mar had made the cash withdrawals at various ATMs in Singapore and remitted all the stolen money to her family members back home.\nFollowing investigations, Mar was arrested on May 2 when she arrived at Changi Airport and was charged the next day. It is not known why she returned to Singapore.\nOn Thursday, State Prosecuting Officer Lam Peng Choy sought a custodial sentence for Mar, but left the duration to the court’s discretion.\nMr Lam added: “The accused had stolen a large amount of money from a vulnerable and elderly victim, whom she has been employed to take care of.\n“No restitution has been made.”\nIn mitigation, Mar pleaded for the court’s leniency, adding that she had to support her sick parents in Myanmar who are also facing financial difficulties due to the political situation.\nDistrict Judge Ong Chin Rhu said that she had considered the “full circumstances” when meting out the sentence, including the stolen amount and the age of the victim, as well as Mar’s intention to plead guilty at the earliest opportunity. \nFor committing theft, Mar could have been jailed for up to three years or fined, or both."

            "Article Body": "Malaysian student Dzafran Azmir did not need his seatbelt fastened, with everything going smoothly on his Singapore Airlines flight from London to Singapore, but he kept it buckled all the same.\nThe seatbelt sign on board SQ321 was switched off and the flight crew were serving food. People were walking around with some waiting to enter the lavatory, he told CNA938 on Wednesday (May 22).\n“I think people would just relax (in such situations). I just… don't unbuckle when the sign says you can unbuckle. I just leave it on,” he said. \nIt meant that the 28-year-old escaped unscathed when the plane hit an extreme patch of turbulence on Tuesday, sending passengers who were not buckled in flying to the ceiling of the aircraft before slamming back down. \nMr Geoff Kitchen, a 73-year-old British man who is said to have served his local community for decades, died on the flight. Suvarnabhumi Airport general manager Kittipong Kittikachorn said a heart attack was the likely cause of death.\nMr Dzafran, who is now back home in Malaysia for his summer break, said going through the turbulence was like being on the “crest or precipice of a really tall roller coaster”.\n“You have that anticipation of going up. And at that point, I felt like I needed to brace onto my belt and kind of like secure myself because at that exact moment, when the plane started pulling up and then dipping down, that's how everything just got really, really bad in the plane,” he told CNA’s Singapore Tonight on Wednesday. \nMr Dzafran initially thought it was regular turbulence and waited for the plane to get through it. However, the situation quickly became confusing when the plane started shaking more and more violently.\n“The people who were unsecured, (were) just slamming straight to the top of the cabin, hitting the overhead luggage compartment or the lights and where the oxygen mask compartments would be,” he said.\nThen, they were “slamming straight down on the armrests, hitting their backs, hitting their heads on something”, he said.\n\"Everything happened really in a flash,\" he said, adding that people immediately started gasping and screaming.\nWhen the turbulence subsided, there was an announcement to acknowledge what had happened and a call for medical professionals who could volunteer to check on the passengers. A couple of people answered the call and made some rounds to provide some basic triage, Mr Dzafran said.\n“The passengers also were told to sit down and hang tight but at the same time, amid all this chaos and confusion, I felt … that people, you know, couldn't really absorb what was to be prioritised, what was happening,” he said. \nPeople who were not hurt were walking around looking for their phones, which had been ripped out of their hands due to the force of the turbulence, he added. They were urgently looking for a way to get in touch with their loved ones.\nMr Dzafran eventually found his phone as well.\nHe said he did not realise the extent of the damage and injuries until the plane made an emergency landing in Bangkok.\n“These panels above our heads… They were literally broken and shattered by people's heads and bodies impacting them. You just were dazed, in some sense, to not realise what was happening,” he said.\nAfter landing in Bangkok, medics and nurses checked on the passengers, added Mr Dzafran.\n“After a while, we started seeing that they started opening up the emergency exits. People from the fire department rescue team came in and that's when the stretchers came in to help deal with the victims who had been really seriously injured — the ones who couldn't get up and couldn't walk and needed to be carried out,” he said.\n“I think that's probably one of the most horrifying, also shocking moments.”\nEn route to Bangkok, he had no idea of how badly his fellow passengers were injured because he could only see those who appeared to have minor injuries. \nThe uninjured passengers disembarked, leaving behind the people with minor or moderate injuries for them to get treated, he said.\n“That was a really good approach by the airport and staff at SIA in terms of making sure that both the injured and uninjured were well taken care of, and I think it was a very smooth process overall,” he added.\nWhile he felt anxious and exhausted over the incident, Mr Dzafran said this turned to relief when SIA’s relief flight arrived about seven to eight hours later to bring the passengers to Singapore. \n“(There was a) sense of feeling that the ordeal is over. We got into that plane and we received a very comforting message from the SIA crew,” said Mr Dzafran, who was thankful he did not sustain any physical injuries.\nMr Greg Waldron, Asia managing editor of FlightGlobal, told CNA938 that the phenomenon of clear air turbulence — a reason experts have pointed to for the violent turbulence — is not really that easy to predict, and that it can be a “very sneaky phenomenon”.  His firm offers editorial coverage of the Asia-Pacific aerospace and airline sectors.\nMr Waldron said that investigators will look very carefully at what was happening with the aircraft, what was happening on the sensors and the visibility in the cockpit. \nThey will gather information from the cockpit voice recorder - which records discussions among the crew — and, more importantly, from the flight data recorder which is the aircraft’s main memory, he said.\n“Any control inputs that have been taking place during the flight, any changes in altitude or speed, any type of control services, what the engines were doing — all those parameters are in the flight data recorder,” he said.\n“(Investigators will) be able to really look at that and see kind of the trauma that the aircraft underwent during this time.” CNA\nFor more reports like this, visit cna.asia."

            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — This year’s National Day Parade (NDP) will feature a warfighting demonstration between the Padang and Marina Bay to commemorate 40 years of total defence, Singapore’s national defence concept. \nThe inaugural segment will showcase how the community and government respond to various scenarios such as air and maritime threats as well as civil emergencies and disruptions, the NDP executive committee said on Thursday (May 23).\nNDP 2024 will also feature an Onward March at the Padang for the first time, where marching contingents will march onto the spectator stand.\nSpectators can also look forward to an immersive 360-degree experience with enhanced multimedia and fireworks effects, the exco said in a news release.\nCrowd favourites such as the Red Lions, state flag flypast and presidential gun salute will continue to be part of the NDP and will be broadcast live on television and internet platforms. \nLast year's National Day parade was also held at the Padang, the first time since 2020. The Padang was the venue for Singapore's first NDP in 1966. It has also hosted the NDP in years with milestone celebrations, such as SG50 in 2015 and Singapore's bicentennial in 2019.\nThis year’s NDP celebrations will be extended to the Promontory @ Marina Bay on Aug 9, as well as to five heartland areas on Aug 10.\n\nThe public can look forward to live performances, fireworks, static displays of vehicles from the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), Singapore Civil Defence Force and Singapore Police Force, as well as carnival activities at the five heartland areas. More details will be available at a later date.\nSpeaking to reporters on Thursday, exco chairman Brigadier-General (BG) Wilson Low said organisers are expecting 27,000 people at the Padang, similar to previous years. \nBut there could be a 15 to 20 per cent increase in the number of people gathering at Marina Bay due to activities such as the coordinated warfighting demonstration, he added.\nThere will be one more National Education show, bringing the total to four, to accommodate the Secondary 3 students who were unable to catch the National Education show when they were in Primary 5 due to Covid-19 restrictions.\nThose who will be in Secondary 3 next year will similarly be invited to the National Education Show in 2025.\nThe theme for this year’s NDP is \"Together, As One United People\", which highlights the \"collective strength\" of Singaporeans and emphasises the importance of every citizen rallying together to shape Singapore’s future and uplift those around them, said the exco.\nBG Wilson Low said: \"For this year, our theme of 'Together, As One United People' calls upon Singaporeans from all walks of life to come together, to express their love for Singapore, to celebrate the progress of our nation and importantly to show care and concern for others around them.\" \nThe logo for NDP 2024 is a play on \"SG\" and \"59\" to symbolise Singapore and the country’s 59 years of independence.\nThe logo also features five stars representing Singapore’s ideal of democracy, peace, progress, justice and equality, as well as six ascending strokes to symbolise the pillars of Total Defence — military, civil, economic, social, psychological and digital defence. \nThe exco added that NDP 2024 continues to build on previous NDP community outreach efforts to promote volunteerism and inclusivity among Singaporeans through campaigns such as #TogetherAsOneSG and #GiveAsOneSG campaigns.\n#TogetherAsOneSG aims to encourage Singaporeans to come together to celebrate the nation’s birthday. Meanwhile, #GiveAsOneSG seeks to raise awareness of volunteering and encourage participation in meaningful activities to give back to society.\nThis year's theme song, Not Alone, pays homage to past NDP songs by incorporating familiar lyrics which evoke nostalgia and rekindle Singaporeans’ connection to \"patriotic sentiments\", said the exco. \nIt added: \"The song's progression into an uplifting second half aims to foster a sense of belonging among Singaporeans, transcending barriers and instilling a familial bond.\"\nThe song is composed and performed by singer-songwriter Benjamin Kheng, who is in the Singapore band The Sam Willows. \nKheng said on Thursday that the prospect of writing the National Day song is \"very exciting and slightly terrifying\" for every musician and writer. \n\"We put all our hopes, our dreams, our feelings about our country into one song that has to work for everyone ... from your primary school boy to your 'kopitiam' aunty. Everyone has to know it and sing it.\" \nHe added that the references to past NDP songs were deliberate. \"I really wanted to connect Singaporeans back to the meaning and the feeling of these beautiful lyrics that we hear every single year,\" Kheng added. \nThe music video featuring Kheng and SAF's Music and Drama Company ensemble is jointly directed by Koo Chia Meng, Brian Gothong Tan, and Davier Yoon.\n\nThe music video combines two visual styles, with the first being minimalistic and introspective highlighting Singaporeans’ journey through the past 59 years, the exco said on Thursday. The second style features vignettes of both past and present Singapore.\n\"Reflecting the title of the song, Not Alone, the music video celebrates our strong bonds, depicting Singaporeans working, playing, learning, and living together,\" the exco added.

            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — About 15,000 to 20,000 public and private homes are planned for a new housing estate at Turf City in Bukit Timah over the next 20 to 30 years, announced Minister for National Development Desmond Lee on Thursday (May 23). \nThis is the first time in almost 40 years that public housing has been planned in Bukit Timah, he added. \n\"This is to meet the growing aspirations among Singaporeans to live closer to their workplaces in the city.\" \nAccording to the Housing and Development Board's (HDB) website, there are about 2,500 flats in Bukit Timah. \nThe Turf City estate will be car-lite, pedestrian-friendly, and well-served by public transport, said the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) in a separate press release. \nThe 176-hectare site was home to Singapore's second racecourse from 1933 to 1999, until the Singapore Turf Club relocated to Kranji, noted Mr Lee. \nThe site has been largely zoned for residential use since 1998, but was leased out for lifestyle and recreational use until the end of 2023, he added.\nThe government is planning for 10-minute neighbourhoods, which means that most amenities will be located within a 10-minute walk away.\n“These amenities will also be located close to the MRT stations to maximize convenience for all, including for existing residents who live nearby,” he added. \nAssessments on the heritage and environmental impacts were conducted in conjunction with heritage and nature groups respectively, said the National Development Minister. \nWith its history as one of Singapore's racecourses, the heritage impact assessment recommended retaining and repurposing significant buildings. \nTwenty-seven buildings and structures that represent \"different facets\" of the Singapore Turf Club's history will be studied for retention and repurposing, said Mr Lee. \nOne example is the North Grandstand, which was completed in the 1980s. A new central open space in front of the grandstands, about twice the size of the Padang, will be the centrepiece of the estate, he added. \nThe new open space will be oval-shaped, referencing the geometry of the historic racetracks, and is intended for sports and recreational use, said URA in the press release. \nThe new oval open space, estate, future neighbourhoods and public spaces all need to be named, said Mr Lee, inviting members of the public to send in their suggestions. \nFour neighbourhoods with working names have been proposed for the estate, featuring new public spaces integrated with existing heritage buildings. \nFor example, the Racecourse neighbourhood will be anchored around the grandstand and the new oval open space. Residents there can look forward to recreational spaces and sports facilities within a five-minute walk to the upcoming Cross Island Line MRT Station, which is slated to open in 2032. \nThe Saddle Club Knolls neighbourhood will be defined by \"undulating terrain and surrounding forests\". \nThe former Bukit Timah Saddle Club Clubhouse and Fairway Quarters buildings at 51 Fairways Drive and 53 Fairways Drive could be repurposed for this area, URA said in the press release. \nThe Stables Commune neighbourhood will be located along Dunearn Road, and the formers workers quarters and stables will house small-scale lifestyle offerings. The Tinggi Hills neighbourhood will be situated at the foothills of Bukit Tinggi, within former golf course land. \nThe Bukit Timah Turf City estate will be served by Sixth Avenue Station on the Downtown Line and another station on the upcoming Cross Island Line, with residents expected to be within 800m or a 10-minute walk from an MRT station, complemented by buses, said URA in the press release.  \nThe estate will be developed progressively, starting with areas closing to existing transport nodes along Dunearn Road. \nIn feedback sessions, residents living nearby had concerns about traffic, said Mr Lee. \nTo accommodate anticipated traffic from future developments, road improvement works will be rolled out at Dunearn Road, Bukit Timah Road and Eng Neo Avenue. Agencies are also studying the technical feasibility and environmental impact of implementing a new exit ramp from the PIE towards Tuas, said URA in the press release. \nThe government also received feedback about the potential height of the proposed developments, said the National Development Minister. \n\"Building heights will be kept lower where they are closer to key heritage buildings, green spaces as well as existing low-rise housing areas, while those more centrally located and nearer the MRT stations will be built higher to optimise land and enable more people to enjoy the convenience of living close to key transport nodes,\" he added. \nThe environmental impact assessment found 177 plant species and 25 animal species of conservation significance, including the globally threatened straw-headed bulbul and Sunda pangolin. Many of these species were found in Eng Neo Avenue Forest and Bukit Tinggi. \nThe study recommended retaining these two forested areas and connecting them, the press release read. \nMost of Eng Neo Avenue Forest and Bukit Tinggi will be retained, and a new 100-m wide planted connection will be established between the two habitats, said URA in the press release. \n\"In total, about one-third of the Bukit Timah Turf City estate will be set aside for green spaces, comprising parks, open spaces as well as natural greenery,\" said Mr Lee.

            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — A badminton coach of a secondary school team sent sexual messages to several female students and later engaged in sexual acts with one of them when she was 15 years old.\nThe married man, now aged 33, was sentenced to three years' jail on Thursday (May 23) after he pleaded guilty to two charges of engaging in sexual acts with a person under 16 years of age.\nThe court heard that the man had been hired by the secondary school as a badminton team coach in 2017 but was later dismissed in June 2019 after reports about his behaviour began to emerge.\nThe school principal and head of department of co-curricular activities and physical education were notified that the coach had sent inappropriate private messages on Instagram to students, including girls not in the badminton team.\nDeputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Santhra Aiyyasamy told the court that the student had gotten to know the coach when she joined the team in Secondary 1.\nSometime between March and April 2017, the two started following each other on Instagram where they began private messaging and chatting about daily events.\nThis progressed into the coach fetching the teenager home after their school badminton training sessions and occasionally taking her out for meals. He also conducted free private badminton coaching sessions for her.\nIn 2018, when the student was about 14 years old, the coach started to hold her hands in public and also hugged and kissed her when they were alone in his car.\nHis attention made her feel special, even though he had told her that they could be in only an \"unofficial\" relationship since he was married, DPP Santhra said.\nSometime after the girl turned 15, the coach texted her a checklist of intimate questions, which included whether she had kissed anyone and if she had sexual intercourse before.\nThe court heard that although she felt awkward receiving this from the coach, she was \"not surprised\" since she knew that he liked her.\nThis was when the coach asked if he could have sex with her but she refused. \nHe then persisted, adding that he was \"sad he was not the first to have sex\" with her, and she eventually agreed.\nDuring this time, he was aware that he was being investigated by the school for sending inappropriate private messages to students and had terminated his employment as a school coach. \nSometime between Sept 10 and 14 in 2019, the teenager met the coach at a sports club where they engaged in sexual acts, including sexual intercourse.\nBefore they parted ways, the teenager asked the coach why he had removed the condom during sexual intercourse.\nThe coach responded to her with a laugh and told her that it \"did not feel as nice\" when wearing one.\nThe coach and the teenager kept communicating via private messaging after that and when she expressed concerns about getting pregnant, he told her \"not to worry\" and asked if they could meet to have sex again.\nThe teenager refused and the coach suggested meeting for a private badminton coaching session instead. She agreed.\nAt the session, the coach kissed her and asked if she could engage in a sex act, which she agreed.\nDPP Santhra said that the girl had agreed to do so because she felt indebted to him for his kindness.\nThe two eventually drifted apart after that and contacted each other only occasionally through text messages.\nFollowing the two sexual encounters, the teenager began to realise that what the coach had done to her was not right and she texted him to say that she felt \"dirty\" for what had happened between them.\nShe was hoping to get an apology from him because she wanted closure.\nHowever, the coach refused to apologise and told her that what he did was to \"care for her\".\nShe eventually sought help from her school counsellors in 2022 and filed a police report.\nThe coach was arrested on July 28, 2022. He admitted to the police that he had engaged in sexual acts with the teenager, who was 15 then, as well as sending her a nude photo of himself through a private message on Instagram.\nAll his text messages with the teenager, however, were discovered to have been deleted. \nSeeking a jail term of 48 months, DPP Santhra argued that there was a high degree of premeditation and persistence from the coach during the course of his offending.\n\"He had set the stage since 2017 to wait for the opportunity to engage in sexual acts by chatting with her on a daily basis, exhibiting kind gestures such as sending her home after school training sessions, and giving her a listening ear while she was feeling down,\" she said.\n\"All of these were done while he was still her badminton coach.\"\nThe man abused his position of trust as a coach because even after the school had terminated his employment, he was still communicating with the victim and had provided private coaching services.\nSeeking a more lenient sentence, defence counsel Yamuna Balakrishnan from Tembusu Law LLC said that there was no abuse of trust on her client's part since he was no longer the badminton coach and had limited authority or influence as coach when he committed the sexual acts. \n\"He did not pressure or coerce her into participating in sexual acts,\" Ms Yamuna added.\nHowever, District Judge Lim Tse Haw disagreed and pointed out that the abuse of trust had begun when he sexually groomed the victim with his kind acts.\n\"There was a high degree of premeditation in sexual grooming, when she was about 13 years old, which escalated to him being intimate with her when he held her hands in public and hugged and kissed her in the car,\" he said.\nFor each count of engaging in sexual acts with a person under 16 years of age, the coach could have been jailed for up to 10 years or fined, or both."

            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — The planned performance of a South Korean DJ “monk” must not involve any religious elements if it is to proceed, the police said on Tuesday (May 21) after issuing an advisory to the nightclub involved in staging the event. \nThe entertainer, known as DJ NewJeansNim, has gained notoriety for performing while wearing a monk's robe and incorporating Buddhist mantras into his set.\nThe man, who is not affiliated with the popular K-pop group NewJeans, is currently scheduled to perform his first show in Singapore at Club Rich on Jun 19 and Jun 20. \nPromotional material by the club, which is located along Middle Road, showed the DJ sporting a shaven head and clad in a monk’s robe, with his hands in a prayer position. \nThe Singapore Police Force (SPF) said in a statement on Tuesday night that it was aware of the planned performance and had engaged the licensee and stakeholder of the club.\nCNA has contacted Club Rich for comment. \nAccording to the Public Entertainment Licence conditions, the licensee must ensure that the public entertainment provided at their premise is not likely to be offensive to any race, religion, ethnicity or nationality or potentially cause disharmony amongst different groups. \n“Given the nature of the planned performance, the act may be in violation of this condition,” said the police.\nThe club has acknowledged the advisory and informed the police that it will ensure that the performance adheres to the licensing conditions. \nThis includes ensuring that the performance will not involve any elements associated with religion, be it in the attire, hand gestures, artefacts, songs and lyrics, said SPF. \nMinister for Home Affairs and Law, K Shanmugam noted that the performer has used religious verses in song lyrics and a Buddhist prayer item in his previous shows. \n“This would have been offensive to our Buddhist community. This is not acceptable,” he said in a Facebook post on Wednesday. \n“Police have told the nightclub owners that action will be taken, if the performance proceeds. They understood our position, and have agreed to cooperate. \n“This news has come out on Vesak Day, an unfortunate coincidence. But the Buddhist community, (like other communities) knows that the government will take firm action, in respect of such things.”\nMinister for Culture, Community and Youth and Second Minister for Law, Edwin Tong said late on Tuesday that the government has “clear rules” about what can or cannot be staged at such public entertainment performances.\n“The rationale is very clear; we live in a multi-racial, multi-religious and multi-cultural society, we respect each other, and we take steps to protect our social cohesion.\n“We take a very serious view of acts which denigrates religion. This is an offence, and cannot be tolerated.”\nHe added that the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth has worked with the police, which has “proactively engaged” the licence holder, and reminded them to adhere strictly to the licence conditions. \n“The licence holder has assured the police that they will ensure that any performance staged will adhere to the licensing conditions, including ensuring that the performance will not involve any elements which is associated with religion.”\nThe Singapore Buddhist Federation had earlier called for the cancellation of the show. \n \n\"NewJeansNim is not a monk who should not put on monk's robe to perform, which is against (the) Vinaya [the code of conduct for Buddhist monks]. Hopefully, relevant authorities (are) able to reject the permits for (his) performance so (as) to avoid bringing embarrassment to Buddhists,” it said on Sunday. \nNewJeansNim previously faced backlash for his performances in Malaysia from Venerable Jue Cheng, the chief abbess of Fo Guang Shan in Singapore and Malaysia, as well as Wee Ka Siong, the president of the Malaysian Chinese Association.\nFollowing the controversy, NewJeansNim's remaining shows in Malaysia were cancelled.\nNewJeansNim, whose real name is Yoon Seong-ho, has experienced a steady rise in popularity in South Korea in recent months.\nSouth Korea's largest English-language newspaper The Korea Herald reported that The Jogye Order, South Korea’s largest Buddhist sect, has employed NewJeansNim as part of its outreach efforts.\nIn a meeting with NewJeansNim, the president of The Jogye Order Venerable Jin-woo said: \"I am thankful for the work you have done in spreading a much younger Buddhism to the young generation.\"\nIn that same meeting, Venerable Jin-woo also presented NewJeansNim with prayer beads and a headset.\nFor more reports like this, visit cna.asia."

            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — A total of 131 passengers and 12 crew members who were aboard a Singapore Airlines (SIA) flight badly hit by turbulence arrived at Changi Airport in the early hours of Wednesday (May 22). \nThe scheduled London to Singapore flight diverted to Bangkok after the plane was buffeted by turbulence that flung passengers and crew around the cabin, slamming some into the ceiling.\nPhotographs from the interior of the plane showed large gashes in the overhead cabin panels, gas masks and panels hanging from the ceiling and items of hand luggage strewn around. \nA 73-year-old British man died of a suspected heart attack and at least 30 people were injured, some critically. \nThe British passenger has been named as Mr Geoff Kitchen from Thornbury, near Bristol, in South West England. It is believed he was on board the flight with his wife and headed for a six-week holiday. \nSIA said in an update on Facebook on Wednesday morning that the passengers and crew of SQ321 arrived at 5.05am via a relief flight. \nThey were received upon their arrival at Changi Airport by Chief Executive Officer of SIA, Mr Goh Choon Phong.\n“Transportation to their homes or hotel accommodation has been arranged for passengers travelling to Singapore,\" said the airline. \n“For passengers with onward connections, we have rebooked them on alternative flights. We have also arranged hotel accommodation or lounge access for them to rest until their next flight.” \nReuters reported dozens of passengers quietly filing off a Singapore Airlines jet on Wednesday morning, mostly ignoring media awaiting their arrival. \nSome responded to shouted questions, confirming they had been on the original London-Singapore trip and saying \"Good flight!\" when asked about the last leg from Bangkok.\n\"I saw people from across the aisle going completely horizontal, hitting the ceiling and landing back down in like really awkward positions. People, like, getting massive gashes in the head, concussions,\" Dzafran Azmir, a 28-year-old student on board the flight told Reuters after arriving in Singapore.\nHe had earlier recounted feeling the plane tilt upwards and begin to shake. \n\"Suddenly there was a very dramatic drop so everyone seated and not wearing a seatbelt was launched immediately into the ceiling, some people hit their heads on the baggage cabins overhead and dented it, they hit the places where lights and masks are and broke straight through it.\"\nAs of early Wednesday morning, another 79 passengers and six crew members from SQ321 remain in Bangkok. \nThis includes those receiving medical care, as well as their family members and loved ones who were on the flight, SIA said. \n“A dedicated SIA team from Singapore is in Bangkok to assist our colleagues and the local authorities. We are providing all possible support to the passengers and crew from SQ321 who remain in Bangkok.”\nThe airline also expressed its condolences over the death of the British passenger. \n“On behalf of Singapore Airlines, I would like to express my deepest condolences to the family and loved ones of the deceased passenger. We also deeply apologise for the trauma experienced by all passengers and crew members on this flight,” said Mr Goh. \n“We are providing all possible assistance and support to them, along with their families and loved ones, during this difficult time. The well-being of our passengers and staff is our utmost priority.”\nIn a video message on Wednesday morning, Mr Goh laid out the timeline of events. \nFlight SQ321 encountered \"sudden extreme turbulence\" over the Irrawaddy Basin at an altitude of 37,000 feet about 10 hours after departure from London Heathrow. \nThe flight was carrying 211 passengers and 18 crew members.  \nThe pilot declared a medical emergency and diverted the Boeing 777-300ER aircraft to Bangkok, landing at 3.45pm local time.\n\"Singapore Airlines swiftly dispatched a team to Bangkok last night, and they have been helping our colleagues with the support on the ground,\" he said. \n\"We are fully cooperating with the relevant authorities on the investigations.\"\nSingapore's Transport Safety Investigation Bureau (TSIB), an arm of the Transport Ministry, is opening an investigation into what happened on SQ321.\nIt says it has been in contact with its Thai counterparts and will send investigators to Bangkok.\nRelatives seeking information may contact the Singapore Airlines hotlines at +65 6542 3311 (Singapore), 1800-845-313 (Australia) and 080-0066-8194 (the United Kingdom).\nAircraft tracking provider FlightRadar 24 said at around 3.49pm Singapore time the London-Singapore flight encountered \"a rapid change in vertical rate, consistent with a sudden turbulence event\".\n\"There were thunderstorms, some severe, in the area at the time,\" it said.\nTurbulence has many causes, most obviously the unstable weather patterns that trigger storms, but this flight could have been affected by clear air turbulence, which is very difficult to detect.\nPhotos online and those sent to CNA showed food trays and items scattered on the ground. Oxygen masks were seen hanging from the scaling and parts of the plane's interior appeared damaged.\nPassenger Andrew Davies said the seatbelt sign was turned on moments before the plane dropped. \n\"So many injured people, head lacerations, bleeding ears,\" he wrote on X, adding that a female passenger was screaming in pain.\nSevere turbulence such as the one experienced by SQ321 is \"extremely rare\", analysts said, adding that turbulence does not usually cause fatalities or a large number of injuries.\nIndependent aviation analyst Alvin Lie said the intensity of the turbulence on the Singapore Airlines flight was likely “extreme” - the highest classification by the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) National Weather Service.\nAccording to the agency, extreme turbulence causes a plane to toss violently about and is practically impossible to control. It may also cause structural damage.\nMr Lie told CNA’s Asia Tonight that SQ321 likely encountered clear air turbulence (CAT).\n“Normally, for turbulence caused by movement of clouds, pilots will be alerted on the radar so they can avoid it or notify the crew and passengers to wear their seatbelts,” he said. “So, looking at the number of injuries, I believe that SQ321 encountered CAT, where a plane can be tossed about violently.\"\nCAT can hit anywhere and anytime, he said, reiterating that the phenomenon is rarely severe.\n“There is no way of knowing when or where CAT can happen, or the severity or intensity of it. I believe there were many other planes flying in that area at the same time as SQ321 (but were not affected). It was just hard luck.” CNA\nFor more stories like this, visit cna.asia."

            "Article Summary": "It is normal to procrastinate when we are faced with a boring or difficult task.\nAs each person has different preferences and habits, anti-procrastination methods may not work the same way for everyone.\nExperts said that it is important to recognise \"how\" and \"why\" one procrastinates and tailor the method to the individual .\nTODAY tries three different anti-procrastination methods to see which one works best",
            "Article Body": "Increasingly, people are becoming aware of the importance of mental health and well-being in our lives. In our weekly Gen Zen series, TODAY looks at ways that we can feel better while coping with the mental stresses of modern life.\nSINGAPORE — As someone who struggles to stay focused, anytime I set out to finish a task, it often looks like this: I put down my cup of coffee, turn on my computer, and then end up scrolling on my phone for the next 20 minutes.\nThen in an effort to make my day more productive, I start rearranging my room or doing other things, except what I had set out to do.\nThen surprise! The panic over the deadline sets in and I get a boost of productivity at night. \nSuddenly, my work is completed, and I finally go to sleep at 7am.\nThere lies the problem: In rushing to meet my deadline, I have sacrificed sleep, proper meals and even a daily shower.\nThe accumulation of insufficient sleep and poor nutrition often led to me crashing after each deadline. \nIt also left me feeling too tired to socialise and I end up losing precious time with family and friends.\nI know precisely the problem: I procrastinate too much. So how should I regain my balance and manage this better?\nMental health experts I consulted said that there are broadly four reasons people procrastinate: Boredom, low self-confidence, a lack of competence and stress. \nFinding a task boring, or being overwhelmed by the complexity of the task, can cause one to stall for time. \nNot having the skills to tackle the assignment or feeling the pressure to finish it can also lead to procrastination.\nThen there are other things that people deem as important, but which can be a source of distraction.\nDr Joel Yang, a clinical psychologist at Mind What Matters psychological consultancy firm, said: “Tidying up your room or checking your emails are important. Socialising and having a nap can contribute positively to your mental health. \n“These may not seem like procrastination, but any task can (cause procrastination) when it is one that we use to distract ourselves from our task or goal.”\nExperts said that it is normal to procrastinate, that it is okay to take breaks while on a task.\nMs Amelia Mak from Heartscape Psychology clinic said: “Our limited attention span makes focusing on a task for long periods of time challenging.”\nProcrastination can even enhance productivity when the deadline draws nearer or when there is heightened concentration, Dr Yang said. \nHowever, it becomes an obstacle when excessive procrastination leads to missed deadlines or must-do assignments remain incomplete. \nAt its most extreme, people start to “deny things are important to them” such as school or work, Dr Yang added.\nProcrastination becomes more than just being unproductive when it harms one’s well-being or their relationships with others. \nNegative effects can also come in the form of insufficient sleep, heightened stress and anxiety as deadlines approach and no progress has been made. \nThe key in regulating procrastination is self-awareness, the experts said.\nUnderstanding “how” and “why” one is procrastinating can help with managing the emotions that come with a task. \n“It is important to set aside periodic breaks from tasks so it is intentional and not merely to procrastinate,” Dr Yang said.\nMs Mak advised: “Be reflective on your own procrastination habits and understand these triggers or any patterns to specific tasks.”\nThis means that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to procrastination, but it should instead be adapted to individual preferences and habits.\nI have tried several ways to deal with my habit of procrastinating: Using the timer application Pomodoro, turning to Study-With-Me videos and putting my phone aside.\nIn the end, I had found them ineffective after a while and, after speaking with the experts, I now know why.\nSo, I decided to give the three methods another try, timing how long it took me to write a 500-word article with each of these methods.\nOnly this time, I tailored them to my individual routines.\nPomodoro is a timer app that breaks up work into intervals of 25 minutes followed by a short break. \nIt helps arrange time to provide intentional breaks for people to refresh themselves between study sessions.\nMs Mak advised that the time intervals should be fitted within the individual’s threshold of attention.\nSo I tried a 35-minute focused session with a five-minute rest, which suits me as I reached the break just as my focus was running out. \nI was able to finish my task in two hours and 23 minutes.\nHowever, having my phone beside me as a timer made it difficult to resist using my phone. \nAs time dragged on, my attention span waned and the 35 minutes started to feel too long. \nStudy-With-Me videos are made by creators who film themselves studying while inviting others to join them.\nHaving environmental cues can help in facilitating focus and create a sense of belonging with the shared struggle of having to get work done. \nUsing this method, I completed the task in the shortest time: One hour and 18 minutes. \nWatching live comments of how others were also struggling with their work helped reduce the stress that I felt from doing the task.\nBeing able to interact with others in the comments also helped me deal with boredom. \nThe only downside was the occasional advertisement that popped up.  \nPhones can be a major distraction so I tried putting it out of my reach until I completed the task. \nThis was more effective than Pomodoro and it took me one hour and 29 minutes to finish the task. \nI was able to resist the impulse to check my phone whenever I felt stressed and took a walk around my house when I was tired. \nHowever, this method is not always feasible for me since there are times where I need my phone for work.\nWhile I found the most success with the Study-With-Me videos, experts said that one can try out different methods and adjust them accordingly.\n“Most importantly, allow for self-compassion and acknowledge that setbacks may occur in trying to kick the habit of procrastination,” Ms Mak said.\nAlthough these solutions don’t guarantee that I will always be productive, it has reduced the amount of time I spend on a task and allowed me to reconnect with my family and friends."

            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — Instead of attending preschool like other children his age, four-year-old Atlas Wong, who was named after his parents' passion for travel, is doing his learning while flying across the globe.\nOver the last four months, he has travelled to 22 countries including Belgium, France, Greece and Turkiye. His jet-setting life will continue until he is six, with destinations such as Canada, Japan and the United States still to come.\n\nHis parents, civil servants Rakcent Wong, 35, and Carol Tan, 36, came up with the 50-country list after they promised each other that they would take their child on \"worldly adventures\" before he started formal school.\nMr Wong, who like his wife is on a two-year sabbatical from his job, said: \"Atlas means a bundle of maps. Since we already planned to travel around the world, we thought this would be an appropriate name (for him).\" \nBefore Atlas was born, Mr Wong and his wife frequently embarked on short trips overseas. With every trip, the couple said that they learned more about themselves and the cultures in the places they visited.  \nHe added: “Travelling has such a strong transformative power, and we want to gift it to our child despite people telling us that we should stop travelling after having a kid.” \nWhen I first heard about their two-year sojourn after chancing upon their joint Instagram account Engaging Atlas, I was in awe. The idea of taking time off from work and life to travel seemed so out of reach for an average working adult.  \nYet here they were, somehow managing to \"live the dream\" with their young son, determined to show him places I might not get to visit in my lifetime. \nApart from myself, more than 11,500 followers eagerly tune in to get a glimpse of their adventures through the account, meticulously curated by Atlas' parents.\nEvery day, the couple sets out with their phone camera, capturing various sights, sounds and experiences.\nEach video is marked with a country flag and the day of their travel so that viewers may easily track when and where the family has been.\nThat was why when I arranged to meet them online on a FaceTime video-call, I had a question that I was dying to ask: How in the world are they able to do all this?\nTo my question, Ms Tan said that their two-year trip is being funded from their savings, which they accumulated from living frugally for five years from the time before Atlas was born. \n“We set this five-year target because we thought Atlas should be more independent by then.\n“He should be able to eat on his own and walk a bit further, and when we come back, it would be just in time for primary school. So we felt this was the right time,” Mr Wong said.\nThe family was in Cyprus at the time when we spoke. This week, they are in Nepal.\nAfter doing their sums, the couple calculated that the trip would cost them an average of S$150 a day, inclusive of the cost of flight tickets.\nMr Wong admitted that it was tough at the start because he had to really scrutinise his wife’s finances.\n“She appreciates the finer things in life,” he said with a laugh. \nMs Tan said that before they made this decision to travel for an extended period of time, she led a more indulgent lifestyle and had no qualms about splurging on cafe food and branded bags every now and then. \n“After that, I realised I wasn’t truly happy even when I spent on these items. Travelling, however, gave me a different perspective on life. So I changed my mindset to focus on valuable experiences instead of materials, and I managed to save up for our financial goal of travelling,” she added.  \nThe couple do not own a car and have been living in a four-room Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat since 2016, before Atlas was born.\n\nThey mostly ate cheap hawker food and relied on public transport to get around, and made it a point to take the cheapest flights available over the course of their two-year journey. \nEven with such decisions, it was a trade-off that was unpalatable to some, the couple told me.\n“Our parents were very supportive because they knew how free-spirited and adventurous we are. But our friends, especially our colleagues, told us we should stop our adventures now that we have a kid,\" Ms Tan said. \nThese comments did not deter the couple but spurred them instead to push ahead with their plans, even if it meant forgoing income and the ability for Atlas' grandparents to see him in person for two years.  \nTheir journey started on Jan 17 when they left Singapore for Greece. The couple decided that this would be their first location for practical reasons — they managed to snag cheap flight tickets for about S$300 a person. \nThere, they visited the black sand beach in the island of Santorini, where the sand is made of volcanic material and lava fragments, and witnessed the sunset at the picturesque village of Oia.\nSince then, they have visited more than 20 places in Europe, including Montenegro, Bosnia, Croatia, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland. \nThese were places that I had only read about or seen on television, but never in real life.\nTruth be told, I was more amazed than envious, because it wasn't that I couldn't afford to travel to these dreamy locales, but it was just an unimaginable thought that I would have to set aside my commitments to be abroad.\nAlso, for a start, travelling to all these places with a young child in tow sounded tiring.\nHowever, as Mr Wong and Ms Tan regaled me with tales of their epic travels, it was hard to tell that they were suffering from any travel fatigue.\nRight before our FaceTime session at 1pm Singapore time, the pair told me that they had not slept in 24 hours. \nThe couple had just reached Cyprus — it was 8am over there — after braving a red-eye (overnight) flight from Turkiye the night before. \nYet, to my eyes, I could hardly detect any homesickness or exhaustion, as the couple excitedly shared how their next steps would take them to Nepal, where they plan to stay for a month to maximise their travel visa validity period there.\nAs to exactly where they will be, Mr Wong said that they have no concrete itinerary or plan in place, except that they have to be in Kenya by July because that is the best time for a safari visit.\nAt this point, I thought about how the longest I've been away from home for travels was two weeks. I cannot fathom ever needing to extend a trip just so I could get the most out of my travel visa.\nAfter all, I am not someone who can live without Asian cuisine for more than two days.\nMr Wong and Ms Tan said that coping with the lack of Singapore food was one of the hardest moments they had to experience during their global adventure. Two weeks after departing Singapore, Atlas asked for char siew (barbecued pork) rice.\n“Char siew rice was his comfort food because we would have it once every three to four days. It was so easy to 'dabao' (Chinese for take-away) when the stall was just downstairs,\" Ms Tan said, recalling that this happened while they were in North Macedonia. \n“I felt so bad because I couldn’t find char siew rice for him. His diet was my biggest concern.”\nRefusing to be defeated by this, she then sought to level up her cooking skills in order to whip up Singapore meals for Atlas and her husband whenever they wanted a taste of home. \nTo the couple, the most challenging part of their journey was not related to finances, pausing their careers or navigating new places. Rather, it was having to be a good parent to Atlas while coping with travel anxieties.\n\"Parenting is always a challenge,\" Mr Wong said. \"Balancing it with travel and other responsibilities adds an extra layer of difficulty, especially when we're on our own out here.\"\nHe and his wife admitted that the journey so far has not been all butterflies and rainbows. \"But we embraced the journey as a family, knowing it would be the most rewarding part,\" Mr Wong added.\nAt the end of the day, the trip is not meant for the couple to indulge themselves, they said. It was conceived from the start to give Atlas an enriching adventure.\nTo this, Mr Wong recalled how, in Lyon, France, their son saw the exposed mechanism of a cable car and decided to pepper his parents with questions about it.\nFar from being put off, Mr Wong said that hearing the boy's questions put to rest any doubts that they had when they first decided to embark on their journey.\n“Atlas stood there and watched cable cars go up and down for a good 10 minutes. He asked specific questions like, ‘How does this work? Why is it like this?’ \n“We thought this would be a good skill that he could use further in life because when you learn things, you need to know the reasons why. And when you’re curious, that’s when your knowledge will expand,” Ms Tan said. \nAsked if she was worried about how Atlas may fit into Singapore's primary school system when he reaches six, Ms Tan admitted that her son might not be \"used to sitting down\".\n“But with this sense of wonder he has shown throughout the trip, I’m sure he will become an effective learner when he’s older,” she said.  \nI wish I could've seen Atlas on camera, but he was sound asleep at their lodging in Cyprus given that their red-eye flight was just hours before.\nI couldn't help thinking how it was so good that he has parents who believed that life lessons are best learned through exploration and exposure, and who were willing to pause their own lives to grant him a memorable childhood.\nIt should go without saying that such a sojourn may not be for everyone, but a little part of me wonders if I would have had a different worldview had I gone on such a trip at Atlas' age. \nAs the famed American zoologist Jack Hanna once said: \"The world is the true classroom. The most rewarding and important type of learning is through experience, seeing something with our own eyes.\""

            "Article Summary": "Amid the increasing awareness of mental health, meditation apps have proliferated to help people find some zen.\nThese apps offer valuable tools for reducing stress and anxiety, improving focus and enhancing sleep quality.\nTODAY tested out five popular options to compare their prices and offerings .\nWhile each has its strengths, some are more suited to beginners and some to more seasoned practitioners",
            "Article Body": "Increasingly, people are becoming aware of the importance of mental health and well-being in our lives. In our weekly Gen Zen series, TODAY looks at ways that we can feel better while coping with the mental stresses of modern life.\n\nSINGAPORE — Most of us can agree that stress is a constant in this modern life, and we are also increasingly aware that taking a moment to pause and check in on ourselves is important to our mental health.\nTo those seeking calm amid our endlessly busy lives, meditation is often offered up as a way to ground ourselves. Studies have also shown the benefits of meditation in reducing stress and anxiety, increasing focus and boosting sleep. \nNo surprise then, that a gamut of meditation apps have flooded the app market to provide everyone from meditation novices to seasoned practitioners with convenient ways to zen out.\nIt can be intimidating to get started when there is so much information out there and so many options to choose from. \nAnd so I decided to try out some of the most popular meditation and wellness apps out there to find out which may be best for different segments of the population. \nI measured the apps based their cost, features, intuitiveness and overall experience. \nAfter a week of meditating and hearing soothing voices asking me to close my eyes and focus on my breath, I’ve concluded that finding the right meditation app is a personal journey.\nWhether you prefer an evidence-based approach or more gentle, mindful ways to move, there is an app that understands and caters to your needs.  \nOne of the most well-known apps on the market, Headspace caters to all levels, with introductory courses all the way to more advanced sessions for long-time meditators.  \nThe app offers various structured courses that require users to spend a maximum of 10 minutes a day, from learning the basics of meditation to more targeted courses dealing with issues such as work stress and anxiety.\nIf courses are too much of a commitment, there are also emotion-based single sessions, such as a 10-minute guided meditation for when you are feeling frustrated or gearing up for a difficult conversation.\nHeadspace also offers Sleepcasts, soothing audio to help users fall asleep, as well as animated videos that explain meditation techniques in an engaging way.\nThe app's Mindful Workouts series combines physical exercises and dance with mindfulness practices. For example, their Mindful Cardio series makes running or jogging an intentional and mindful exercise. During the 10-minute run, the coach guides you to check in with your body and notice your surroundings.\nI enjoyed being especially present during the exercise and aware of both my mind and body working together. I left the short session feeling energised and my mind also felt more alert.\nMy experience with Headspace was a breeze. The app's intuitive design and vast library of content made my meditation journey a delightful exploration. \nCost: 14-day free trial, S$17.98 per month, S$138.98 annual subscription\n10 Percent Happier is designed for people who may be skeptical of meditation and want to learn the science behind it, or those who prefer a more practical approach to the practice.\nThe app offers videos that break down the psychology behind feelings such as stress, anxiety and phobias, and offer guided meditation sessions related to each video. \nThese in-depth mindfulness and mental health courses are led by experienced meditation experts, including authors of mindfulness books and academics who teach mindfulness courses at universities.\nThe app also has videos of interviews and talks with meditation experts for those who want to understand the nuts and bolts of the practice.\nPersonally, I found 10 Percent Happier’s courses helpful in learning about meditation from those in the field. I like that there is a short and engaging video that preps you before each meditation session.\nTheir single meditation session also covers a variety of topics taught by different experts, something I quite enjoyed.\nFor single meditation sessions, users can choose the length of the session, which can be as short as 5 minutes or as long as 45 minutes. \nCost: Seven-day free trial, S$19.98 per month, S$138.98 annual subscription\nAnother well-known meditation app, Calm, features guided meditations focusing on stress management, anxiety, and sleep.\nLike Headspace, Calm offers content such as soundscapes, sleep stories and guided breathwork and meditation sessions.\nA defining feature of Calm is the Daily Calm session. Each day the app offers up a 10-minute meditation session that is weaved together with a story.\nThe app has also started offering mindful stretching and light exercise guides called the Daily Move, nuggets of wisdom titled the Daily Jay, and a more fun meditation to start your day with the Daily Trip. \nA unique feature of Calm's Sleep Stories is that they are sometimes narrated by famous personalities.\nI found the Sleep Stories read by Harry Styles and Cillian Murphy especially soothing, while Lebron James's session on training your mind is a masterclass in focus and how to build mental strength.\nThe strength of Calm is its collaboration with actors and singers to add a mindful slant to content you might be familiar with. For example, the app has an hour-long track by American singer-songwriter JVKE entitled \"This Is What Sleep Sounds Like\", a riff on his album track titles. \nCost: Seven-day free trial, S$78.98 annual subscription, S$599,98 one-time lifetime subscription\nDown Dog is a fitness app that includes meditation and breathwork exercises.\nYou can tailor your meditation sessions by choosing the length, focus and background sounds to suit your preferences. \nThe app integrates seamlessly with Down Dog’s other fitness apps, which offer guided yoga, HIIT and barre exercises. A subscription to Down Dog gives you access to all of these apps.\nDown Dog is probably more well-suited to people who are already familiar with meditation and want to be able to jump into a session without any extra videos or frills to sit through.\nCost: Seven-day free trial, S$14.48 monthly subscription, S$88.98 yearly subscription \nInsight Timer is an app with an extensive library of guided sessions and a strong community approach.\nThe app includes a customisable meditation timer with ambient sounds, structured courses and workshops, and a strong community aspect, allowing users to connect with others and join interest-based groups. \nMeditation should not have to cost an arm and a leg and Insight Timer is one of the few apps that offers a free version that allows users access to more than 146,000 guided meditations, talks, podcasts, and music tracks.\nThe free version does not include access to the app's courses, offline listening, or the ability to rewind or fast-forward. \nI was impressed by the variety of guides available on the app —in addition to the usual courses on issues such as stress and anxiety, boundaries and productivity, the app even offers meditation courses on topics such as beauty and ageing. \nInsight Timer's seemingly endless library of guides can be overwhelming for those just starting out, but if you are looking to further your practice or uncover other parts of yourself, this would be a good app to dive into. \nCost: Seven-day free trial, S$13.48 monthly subscription, S$81.98 yearly subscription \nAs someone who tries to keep up with her meditation practice, this experiment in trying out various apps was a helpful to see what works for me. \nI was already subscribed to Calm for its accessible Daily Calm practice and Sleep Stories, but now I'm considering a subscription to 10 Percent Happier too.\nI feel that its evidence-based approach, complemented by informative documentary-style videos, not only enhances my practice but also deepens my understanding of meditation. \nThat said, what is right for me may not be the best choice for everyone else. So I suggest you close your eyes, focus on your breath and start your own exploration of the world of meditation. "

            "Article Summary": "TODAY spoke to grassroot members, ex-colleagues, former staff and a former teacher of incoming Prime Minister Lawrence Wong.\nThey described him as a hardworking person with an eye for details yet does not lose sight of the bigger picture.\nHe was also well-liked by people around him, they said, including \"office aunties\" whom he remembers by name.\nThey also spoke of Mr Wong's passion for the people of Singapore and how he always made residents and Singaporeans his priority",
            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — When he was in the Ministry of Finance (MOF) back in the early 2000s, Mr Lee Kok Fatt remembered how his boss Lawrence Wong, then still a young public servant, would reply emails even while on leave for reservist training.\n“There were some instances when he came back to office in his army fatigue on his 'off' time. That left quite an impression on me,” said Mr Lee, who has held various senior positions in the civil service.\nFor Mr Lee, this memory reflects Mr Wong’s industriousness — one of the upcoming prime minister’s most memorable traits since his younger days.\n“He was probably one of the first to be in office, and the last to leave,” said Mr Lee, who now chairs the Chandler Institute of Governance.\nPeople who have previously interacted with or worked in various capacities with Mr Wong, including grassroot members, civil servants and a former teacher of his, painted a picture of a leader with an eye for policy details yet clear-headed in big-picture thinking, and a boss who has high standards yet is nurturing to those under his charge.\nAs an individual, they described Singapore’s next prime minister as someone who is naturally introverted yet approachable, and one who has grown comfortable in his public persona.\nDespite the years that have passed, they said that what remains constant of Mr Wong is how grounded he is and how he has always put the public before himself.\nMany who have worked with Mr Wong describe him as highly capable and a policy wonk — one who takes interest in intricate details of a policy.\nMr Lee recalled how Mr Wong took it upon himself to be certified Chartered Financial Analyst, a rigorous professional certification that was not needed for his role, despite the heavy workload he shouldered at MOF and the certification not being a necessity for his role.\n“He was already well-qualified for that role. But he just wanted the technical certificate, to get his hands dirty in the very technical aspects of finance,” said Mr Lee.\nMr Wong was a Public Service Commission scholar who earned his bachelor and masters degrees in economics in the United States before he began working in the public service. \nMr Ong Kian Ann, also one of Mr Wong’s former staffers at MOF in the early 2000s, remembered how the division had to engage economic professors to develop econometric models.\n“Throughout the discussion and conversation (with the professors), what struck me was that my boss, at his age then (of about 30), I would say, was in the same league as the professors, with their experience in the industry,” said Mr Ong.\nMr Tan Meng Dui, chief executive of the Housing and Development Board (HDB), said that Mr Wong’s “very good grasp of policy considerations and details” made him “quite easy to work with”.\nMr Tan was deputy secretary at the Ministry of National Development from 2014 to 2018. Mr Wong headed the ministry from 2015 to 2020.\n“This is especially so for public housing, where there are fiscal implications to consider and the housing needs and aspirations of the different segments of our population can be quite different,” he added.\nWhile he demonstrated a sharp eye for details, Mr Wong never lost sight of the bigger picture and was described as clear headed on the strategic level, too.\nMr Wong Siew Hoong, who was director-general for education at the Ministry of Education, recollected how there was robust debate around the introduction of blended learning in schools.\nAfter the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, blended learning was introduced in schools, where home-based learning was incorporated as a regular part of the school calendar.\nWith strong arguments both for and against the proposal, the issue was further complicated by the implications it would have on students, teachers, schools and even parents.\n“You can see his mind working, weighing the different issues, the ups and the downs and then of course to make the political decision,” said the senior advisor at MOE.\n“It was very clear in his mind: If it’s good for students, we should do it.”\nProfessor Tan Thiam Soon, former President of Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) remembered a conversation he had with Mr Wong back in 2012.\nAs then Minister of State for Education, Mr Wong had chaired an MOE committee set up to review university expansion pathways. The committee recommended making the SIT a full-fledged university.  \nProf Tan was the vice provost of education at the National University of Singapore (NUS) and was approached by MOE to move to SIT.\nBefore he made his decision, the professor asked to speak to someone about some concerns he had and was told to meet Mr Wong.\n“He doesn't throw at you lofty ideas, lofty words that could be interpreted in any direction, like a motherhood statement,” said Prof Tan.\n“He was clear about what he felt Singapore needed going forward, how (SIT) fit into the bigger picture. And even at that point, in 2012, he was clear about how the education landscape was going to change with the onset of technology disruptions.”\nProf Tan added: \"That's why I've been here (at SIT) for the last 12 years. If he had said anything else, I could have still stayed at NUS.\"\nHe was also described by some as a leader with high standards.\nMs Zing Lim Tse Yin, former deputy director in the MND Housing Division from 2015 to 2020, said: “He would not take input at face value, and would seek to understand the underlying rationale and sentiment. This encouraged healthy discussions and robust outcomes.”\nAgreeing, Mr Tan said: “DPM (Wong) is disarming and quite unintimidating for a very senior leader. But you do want to be well prepared for discussions with him.\n“He would often make counter proposals, and may have some ideas of his own or would suggest other areas to look at. So, it is important to be rigorous and comprehensive in making a policy recommendation or preparing for a discussion with him.” \nMr Wong was one who, when he spotted any mistakes, would take time to explain to those under him what went wrong and how it could be done better.\n“He is always willing to coach. That has been his trademark (trait) since about 20 years ago,” said Mr Ong.\nThat spirit carried over even to the grassroots, said some volunteers.\nMs Prema Suresh, chairperson of the Indian Activity Executive Committee at Limbang, where Mr Wong is the Member of Parliament, said that while it was common for organisers to feel nervous when a high-profile guest of honour graces an event, Mr Wong never made them feel that way.\n“If there’s a mistake, he would allow us to make it and learn from it, and get it done better,” she said.\nMr Wong’s leadership style was commonly described by those who have worked with him as open and consultative, rather than top down.\n“He explained his thoughts and concerns clearly, shared candidly about his struggles with difficult issues, and was always open to opinions and ideas from anyone in the room,” said Ms Lim, who is now director for rental housing at HDB.\nAgreeing, Mr Tan said Mr Wong would listen to views from people regardless of their seniority — “often actively asking for views or other ideas” — before making a decision or giving guidance.\nProf Tan of SIT recalled how during his conversation back in 2012, Mr Wong spent a fair amount of time listening to the professor’s concerns instead of just laying out his own vision for the university.\n“What also struck me that day was, he actually genuinely listened to me. I would say he listened more than he talked in our meeting,” said Prof Tan.\nThose who worked with him in the early part of his career described him as being generally shy and introverted.\nBased on their impression of his public appearances, they commented that he has since grown to become more comfortable in the public eye.\nWhat has remained constant though, is that Mr Wong is someone who “has no airs around him”, they said.\nMs Prema cited how Mr Wong sportingly joined residents in doing a folk dance at an event last year.\n“He himself said: ‘Hey, let’s come and join the residents and dance’. It was a very memorable thing, not just for me but for those at the event,” she said.\nMr Shi Wei Fei, a youth network volunteer at Limbang, also recalled a light-hearted moment he shared with Mr Wong.\nThe university student was the emcee for two community events that fell on the same day. Mr Wong had attended both events, on top of a few other engagements in between.\n“When he saw me at the second event, he quipped: ‘Wow, you provide full-time emcee service?’. I Imagined he must have felt more tired than me; he didn’t have to joke with me, but he did,” said Mr Shi.\nMr Lee, formerly from MOF, said that Mr Wong could remember the office attendants by name and chatted with them.\n“The office attendants, the aunties in the office, they all liked him a lot. He has good relations at all levels,” said Mr Lee.\nSome who have worked with him before said Mr Wong would still address them by name and asked how they are doing when they bump into each other at events, even if they have not worked closely with each other for years.\nAccording to a former teacher, his affability was apparent from his school days.\nMrs Pang Lay Har, who taught Mr Wong civics and mathematics at Victoria Junior College, recalled how he got along well with his classmates, who came from diverse backgrounds.\n\"He exuded a warm presence, coupled with humility and sincerity,\" said Mrs Pang, who is now vice-principal of Tampines Meridian Junior College.\nThe educator also recalled Mr Wong as a well-rounded student who excelled in his studies — \"he would ask questions and contribute good ideas\" from his usual seat near the back of the class, she said — and in his co-curricular activity, choir.\nAnd while the public probably only took notice of Mr Wong's musical talent after he became a high-profile figure, Mrs Pang knew of his skills some 30 years ago.\n\"He had a flair for music, and I fondly remember being pleasantly surprised when he came to see me with the classmates to sing me a song during Teachers’ Day, and he was playing the guitar,\" she recounted.\nMrs Pang also recalled a conversation she had with the young Mr Wong when he was seeking her advice on scholarships.\n\"We spoke about commitment and serving the bond that comes with the scholarship.  What impressed me was that he was thinking about how he could contribute and serve the community. I knew then this was a promising young man whose heart was in the right place,\" she said.\nThose who worked with him at the grassroots level mentioned how Mr Wong sets aside time for his residents, despite wearing many hats.\nFor example, Limbang has eight residents’ network groups that would typically hold their own celebration for a festive holiday.\n“Sometimes they fall on the same day. So he would be here, and an hour later he would be there (at another one). He tries his best to be with the residents at such festive events,” said Ms Prema.\nMr Shi of Limbang Youth Network describes Mr Wong as an MP who takes residents’ feedback very seriously.\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, resident engagement sessions were held over Zoom and organised by blocks. One resident raised an issue to Mr Wong, who dealt with it promptly, said the volunteer.\n“The resident (some time later) hopped on the Zoom call meant for residents of another block, just to personally say to Mr Wong, ‘Thank you, my problem is resolved’,” he said.\nThis was one example of perhaps one of the key traits that Mr Wong had as a leader: One who puts the community over self.\n“DPM Wong has a big heart — even as prudence and parity are key concerns in policymaking, above all his top concern was to be progressive,” said Ms Lim.\nMr Ong, formerly from MOF, said: “As economists, of course you can make big money in the financial sector. But he chose to be in the public service. \n“He chose to serve because he wants to use his skill set to see how he can shape and form policy for the greater good of Singaporeans as a whole.” \nProf Tan said Mr Wong possesses many qualities that make him “the ideal man” for the politics of this era, which is more centered on inclusivity and a disavowal of elitism.\n“The ability to be humble, the ability not to say I know everything, but to listen to the people and bring their perspectives to the policy — I think it will bring great strengths in what could be a very challenging and difficult time for him and for all of us,” he said.\n"

            "Article Summary": "Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong recently announced plans for having additional safeguards around excessive screen time for children.\nThis came amid a rise in mental health concerns worldwide among the younger generation.\nExperts say that media use for children under two years old has been linked to developmental issues.\nTODAY speaks to eight parents on their personal experiences and challenges in limiting screen time for their children",
            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — Before having children, Ms Lily Khairunnisa and her husband had a vision of raising their future children in a completely \"screen-free\" environment, knowing well the potential harmful effects it could one day bring.\nBut just two years after their first son was born, they came to realise that it was impossible to keep screens away from him, eventually turning to television as a tool to help keep him occupied.\nThey now have three kids aged four, 10 and 11, with the latter two just receiving their own mobile phones a month ago.\n“We need that precious break to keep them quiet so we can do other things like prepping for an outing or even just going to the loo,” said 36-year-old Ms Lily, an investment business owner.\n“These pockets of breaks help keep us sane.”\nLast weekend, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said that the Government would consider additional safeguards around excessive screen time and social media use for children, to protect the mental health of young people.\nHe was speaking at a 55th anniversary event of suicide prevention centre Samaritans of Singapore.\nMr Wong, a patron of the organisation, announced the plan amid an increase in mental health concerns among the younger generation worldwide.\n“Screen time during infancy adversely affects development of cognitive skills needed for self-regulation and learning, as well as socio-emotional competence as the child grows up. This in turn raises the risk of mental conditions, such as depression,” he said in his speech.\nTODAY spoke to eight parents who shared their views and challenges in limiting their children’s use of digital devices. While all agreed that too much screen time is bad for their children, some struggle to cap their usage.\nLike Ms Lily, Mr Derrick Yuen and his wife let their daughter watch nursery rhyme videos while Mrs Yuen does household chores.\nThe 51-year-old data consultant said that it was more about setting a clear, practical rule from the beginning — that screen time is only for whenever it is necessary, but not avoiding it entirely.\nHe limits the use of electronic devices only for school-related activities and does not allow his three children to be on social media.\n“My wife and I wanted our children to have less screen time, not no screen time — given the state of our world today, it would be difficult and impractical,” said Mr Yuen.\nAgreeing, Ms Christine Mah, a workspace services manager, said that the moving images and music in videos have helped her then two-year-old daughter to learn nursery rhymes better.\n“When faced with the various needs of the child and the grandparents who helped raise her, we had to adapt to the changing situations and environment, and to strike a balance between limiting (device) use and meaningful exposure,” she said.\nFor 40-year-old Archita Biswas, it felt like she had “no choice” but to allow her daughter, when she was one year old, to have screen time to ensure she eats. Her daughter is 13 now.\nMs Archita said: “She was never a co-operative eater, so the Disney Junior channel was our saviour. When we switched on the television, at least we were able to feed her a few spoons.”\nTogether with her husband, Mr Vedha Giri, they gradually engaged in “friendly discussions” that do not “sound like a lecture” with their daughter on the health effects of excessive screen time.\nMs Lily said that limiting her children’s screen time came with challenges.\n“My parents and siblings would sometimes offer their phones to my kids even though I've told them that I do not want screen time for them. I would usually just close one eye in these situations.”\nShe added that due to excessive screen times, her children would sometimes throw unnecessary tantrums and show a lack of social awareness, such as not responding to others who call for them.\nLike the rest of the parents interviewed, 50-year-old IT project manager and father of three Maheswaran Subramaniam supports the idea of having additional safeguards on excessive screen time, but he believes that parents still play an important role.\nFellow IT professional Ghazali Maricar, 53, agreed that “everyone can support a common cause” if safeguards are publicly available, instead of just parents taking it upon themselves.\nFamily life educator and consultant Esther Foong-Tan, 39, suggested looking into equipping and resourcing parents with alternative ways to engage children aged four and below.\n“Residents' committees or community centres can organise age-appropriate activities in the neighbourhood for parents to easily bring their children for hours of fun, or forming wholesome and positive parent communities that can share resources and ideas,” said Ms Foong-Tan, who also co-founded parents support group SGFamilies.\n“These can help to free up time for parent-child interactions, as well as manage the stress of parenting.”\nMs Siti Raudah, a 39-year-old teacher and mother of two daughters aged three and five, said that children need to be exposed to more play-based interactions with peers of the same age, be it in school or at home.\n“Game advertisements on YouTube should also be minimised so that their attention will not be diverted to wanting to download these apps,” she added.\nMr Yuen raised concerns on the use of electronic devices as learning tools in schools at a young age.\n“As it stands, I feel that MOE's (Ministry of Education) plan to expose children to mobile devices and the internet in primary school is too early as they are not mature enough and lack self-regulation, especially the boys,” said Mr Yuen.\nEchoing this sentiment, Ms Archita said: “While the safeguards are good, I feel the Government should also stop the usage of learning devices like iPads and Chromebooks in schools as children are using them for a prolonged period, and it is affecting their eye health. They are also diverted to websites that have no links to schoolwork.”\nMs Melissa Goh, a senior lecturer of the early childhood education programme at the Singapore University of Social Sciences, said that studies have shown links between media use for children under two years old and developmental issues like delays in learning languages.\nScreen time or screen-based learning offers a more passive experience of learning that limits benefits across cognitive, social, emotional and physical domains, she added.\n“I would recommend that parents limit the duration and filter the type of media that the child watches by opting for educational shows that are age-appropriate and depict real-life experiences and scenes.”\nShe also proposed counter measures such as having breaks and ensuring that the child has a decent amount of time outdoors and playing with toys or physical objects.\nDr Jason Gan, a lecturer in the same programme, said that the Government should engage parents and caregivers and raise their awareness on the issue.\n“They should specifically address gaps in understanding the implications of excessive screen time and educate parents on utilising 'parental controls' within digital devices.”\nHe also proposed having a national movement such as a \"no screen hour\", which can be an effective way of raising awareness and promoting reduced screen time."

            "Article Summary": "Theatregoers to the Hamilton musical in Singapore, as well as fans of Icelandic jazz-pop singer Laufey due to perform in September here, were surprised to hear that their events would be priced based on demand.\nDynamic pricing for entertainment events has been a hotly debated issue elsewhere, such as in the US.\nIf this becomes a norm in Singapore, fans said they fear that ticket prices will skyrocket.\nBut economists say dynamic pricing is an equitable way to price concert tickets which have been \"traditionally underpriced\".\nThe Consumers Association of Singapore and the Ministry of Trade and Industry told TODAY they are monitoring the impact of dynamic pricing in Singapore's concert industry",
            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — When ticket sales for Singapore’s limited run of the Hamilton musical began last November, an excited Syazwan Ramli, 25, did not hesitate to snag two prime tickets for S$250 each to a Sunday show.\nThe National University of Singapore law graduate was worried that, like so many cases of highly anticipated stage productions in the past year, tickets for the award-winning musical would disappear as soon as they became available because of zealous fans and scalpers.\nSo, to Mr Syazwan at the time, there was no need to think twice, he told TODAY.\nBut his buyers’ remorse set in days after the purchase when Mr Syazwan saw that similar seats for the same category on the weekend were being sold for as low as S$220.\nThe reason for the price difference? Dynamic pricing was in effect, which meant that prices of tickets fluctuated based on demand, instead of the traditional practice of setting prices upfront based on seat categories.\nThis is similar to how surge pricing works for ride-hailing, bookings of hotel accommodation and flight tickets.\nUnder this model, Mr Syazwan paid the maximum price for the category he had selected, though if demand had been low, he would have paid less for the same seat.\n\"I didn't check whether the prices were cheaper on other dates because I was rushing to get tickets and went with whatever I could get,\" he said. \n\"If I had known there would be tickets left and they were cheaper, I would not have rushed and just waited it out... It's really because of FOMO (fear of missing out).\"\nDynamic pricing for entertainment events, such as live concerts, musicals and festivals, is a recent trend in ticketing practices used by event promoters to match ticket prices to demand.\nIn recent years, the US and Canada concerts of American country singer Bruce Springsteen, pop singer Harry Styles, as well as British alt-rock band Coldplay caught flak for implementing dynamic pricing for ticket sales.\nLast year, when US fans of pop singer Beyonce fought over tickets for her Renaissance Tour, prices were pushed upwards of US$1,000 (S$1,350) each because of the dynamic pricing model.\nResponding to the backlash to the Springsteen concert in the US, American ticket sales platform Ticketmaster said dynamic pricing prevents scalpers from buying tickets at face value and reselling them at higher prices for personal profit. \n“Dynamic pricing is about capturing more value for the artist at the initial on-sale, versus that value going to people reselling tickets on the secondary market,” Ticketmaster spokesperson said to US news outlets.\nIn essence, this means the premium that fans are willing to pay for resold tickets goes to the artists, organisers and promoters directly, rather than to the scalpers.\nBut in Singapore, concertgoers fear that such a pricing model may now be creeping into the scene and end up raising the prices of tickets overall.\nAhead of Icelandic jazz-pop singer Laufey’s Singapore concert on Sept 4, several fans were up in arms over an announcement that ticket prices would be \"subject to change in accordance to demand\", with rates starting from S$98.\nNo cap on prices was announced, unlike during the sale of Hamilton tickets in which promoters said dynamic prices would be limited to S$300, depending on the category chosen.\nBut prior to the start of ticket sales on Monday, Laufey’s event promoter Live Nation removed a poster displaying the clause that concert tickets were priced based on demand, though its website still showed that information.\nIt is unclear if tickets were ultimately sold based on dynamic pricing, but the announcement has caused several concertgoers to question whether such a model would become the norm in future.\nTODAY has reached out to Laufey's public relations team and Live Nation for comment.\nNonetheless, Laufey fans went blindly into the ticketing war as they were only informed that prices started at S$98, several fans who spoke to TODAY said.\nUpon entering the ticketing page, they were greeted with a seat map in two different shades of blue. \nSeats indicated in light blue were sold for prices above S$200, while tickets in navy blue were cheaper. Hovering over different categories would show different prices within the hundred-dollar range.\nBut with expected high demand coupled with little time to react before the concert sold out, some fans spent beyond their initial budget to procure the tickets. One 13-year-old fan who wanted to be known only as Irdina left empty-handed.\n\"We didn't know the specific price until the day of the ticket sales. So when I tried to purchase tickets for the category I wanted, it was way higher than expected,\" said the secondary school student.\nBy the time she found a category with prices she could afford, tickets had sold out.\nMr Zachary, 27, is all too familiar with dynamic pricing. The writer and self-professed Taylor Swift fan closely followed the debate around its use for Swift's The Eras Tour in the US last year.\n\"When I saw Laufey's concert was subject to dynamic pricing, I thought 'Oh, they are doing this in Singapore now?',\" said Mr Zachary, a foreigner working in Singapore who declined to share his full name.\n\"It pissed me off because there was no cap on prices. At least Taylor had a max of about US$1,000 so customers knew what to expect.\"\nLaufey's most expensive ticket went for about S$260, which is 160 per cent higher than the S$98 starting price. This was also S$175 more than tickets for the Icelandic singer's performance in June 2023 at Pasir Panjang Power Station, which were priced at S$85.\nMr Zachary added that concerts in Singapore were often already more expensive relative to other venues around the world, so dynamic pricing feels \"unnecessary\".\nAs for 25-year-old civil servant Evangeline Wong, the idea of being the \"guinea pig\" for dynamic pricing was upsetting, given that such a pricing model for concert tickets was unheard of in Singapore until recently. \n\"I know that Singapore is trying to position itself as a concert hub, but this anti-consumer tactic (dynamic pricing) is going to make the already frustrating ticketing process worse,\" said Ms Wong.\nWhile concert promoters elsewhere have claimed that dynamic pricing would deter scalpers by pricing tickets to match what people are willing to pay, Ms Wong felt that the jury is still out on whether this works as scalpers and bots already artificially inflate the demand for concert tickets.\nFor 27-year-old Christalle Tay, who bought a Hamilton ticket under dynamic pricing, she acknowledged that there will be price differences based on demand anyway, since traditionally, weekend tickets fetch a premium over those for weekdays.\nWhile dynamic pricing does not necessarily mean higher prices all the time, she does not believe concert promoters who implement such a model intend to lower prices for tickets with less demand.\n\"As a consumer, I’d obviously prefer if prices were fair and equal. Unless the dynamic pricing was to pass on savings to consumers,\" said Ms Tay, who works as an interpreter. \"But I highly doubt it would.\"\nEconomists told TODAY that dynamic pricing takes into account several factors — supply, demand, time of day and location. In some industries, like ride-hailing services, the weather might also play a factor.\nLike others around the world, dynamic pricing is seen by economists as the most \"equitable\" way to price entertainment event tickets.\n\"Historically, entertainment event tickets like sporting events and concerts have been underpriced,\" said Associate Professor Walter Theseira from the Singapore University of Social Studies, pointing to American football championships The Super Bowl as an example.\n\"This is because they fear not being able to sell out. There's also publicity if people queue for tickets and fans feel appreciated.\"\nBy using dynamic pricing, companies can streamline their offerings according to market demand, allowing them to maximise profits, said Dr Hannah Chang, an associate professor of marketing at the Singapore Management University.\nIn an ideal sense, dynamic pricing would also allow consumers to benefit as prices are lower due to low demand. This helps ensure tickets are not outpriced and seats are left empty.\nBut in terms of how fans view a dynamic pricing approach, the experts said there could be a negative impact on consumer satisfaction.\n\"Though it might help improve efficiency and profits in the process… if fans or concertgoers do not expect it or see it as unfair, this may lead to unhappiness in the market demand side,\" said Dr Chang.\nAssoc Prof Theseira believes that this is because entertainers need to consider fan culture too, which explains why dynamic pricing is generally accepted by consumers for services such as airlines and ride-hailing as the norm, but not for concert tickets.\nHe said customer satisfaction and loyalty are important for an artist's career longevity, and such pricing methods might be seen as a cash grab.\nTo this end, Assoc Prof Theseira said that a dynamic pricing model should also be transparent to consumers so that people can understand how prices are affected.\nGiven that such a system is relatively new here, there is not enough information for people to understand how dynamic pricing is calculated.\nIn response to TODAY, Consumers Association of Singapore (Case) president Melvin Yong said that ticket sales practices should be \"fair and transparent\".\n\"Case is aware of the growing popularity of ticket surge pricing and is studying potential disamenities,\" said Mr Yong, who is also a Member of Parliament for Radin Mas Single Member Constituency.\n\"Events that intend to implement surge pricing for their tickets should inform consumers up front that ticket prices may rise or fall subsequently, so that consumers can make informed purchase decisions.\"\nThe Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) also said that there is no prohibition on such pricing models between willing buyers and sellers, subject to the terms and conditions of the event organiser.\n\"Nonetheless, businesses should communicate prices in a clear and transparent manner, including any relevant terms and conditions,\" said MTI.\n\"Consumers should also familiarise themselves with such terms and conditions so they can make more informed decisions before making their purchases.\"\nThe ministry added it has not received any complaints, but it is monitoring the impact of surge pricing on consumers and the concert ticket industry."

            "Article Body": "This Mother's Day, TODAY speaks to three mothers each facing their own unique challenges when it comes to parenthood. From a mother of autistic twin boys to a single mother who put her dreams on hold, we look at the resilience and love of these mothers who choose to put their children first.\n\nSINGAPORE — When she was a child, Ms Roslindah Aziz would spend her days playing pretend, imagining she was a young teacher reciting the alphabet to her students.\nShe would lovingly \"cook\" meals too for her young charges and hand out homework sheets, reminding each of them to finish them on time. \nHer childhood dreams of being an educator however were put on hold when she went through a divorce at 25. \nWith little help from her ex-husband, her career and dreams took a backseat as she focused her energies on placing food on the table for her then three-year old daughter. \nOver the last 15 years, the 40-year-old has gone through a myriad of jobs such as being a receptionist and a hair stylist, taking whatever came her way so that she could provide for her daughter in their one-room rental flat in Circuit Road.\nDecades after she first thought of being an educator, she got her big break two years ago to fulfill that dream. \nShe now cares for a class of close to 30 primary school pupils from 11am to 7pm on weekdays as a student care provider in Big Heart Student Care Centre in Serangoon. \n“I love kids, but I never thought I could be a (student care teacher). To me, I thought maybe that job needs a really higher education, like a university certificate,” said Ms Roslindah, whose highest qualification is an N-Levels certificate.\nIn 2022, her social worker referred her to Daughters of Tomorrow, a local charity that helps underprivileged women become financially independent and works mainly with individuals who reside in Government-subsidised rental flats. \nMs Roslindah graduated from the charity's eight week Confidence Curriculum course where she received career coaching sessions and was recommended to her current employer, which is one of the charity's partners. \nThe courses are designed to help women get back into the workforce and gain practical skills such as what to say during an interview. There are also workshops where mothers learn from other mothers on how they coped with their financial and family difficulties. \nA team at the charity then helps to provide these women referrals for stable employment.  \nWhen she got married at 21, Ms Roslindah became a full-time homemaker after leaving her job as a receptionist.\nHer then husband took care of the bills and she was \"pampered\" by him, as he made arrangements for housing and daily expenses for her and her daughter.\n\n“I was young at that period of time, when the divorce happened, and I didn’t have the mindset of being afraid of life and didn’t think about what I would have to do to support my family,” said Ms Roslindah, who also supports her parents who are in their 70s. \nWhen her divorce was finalised and her ex-husband also stopped providing maintenance after three months, the realisation that she would now have to do everything alone hit her hard.  \n\"It was most challenging to raise a child, because you're alone and this is your first experience, without for example a helper or parents' help. Money wise, managing finances was also hard, especially the starting two or three years,\" said Ms Roslindah. \nReturning to work was also difficult, as her daughter struggled with being separated from her.  \n“It’s very hard for me to go out to work. Each time I wanted to go out, she would cry... When we needed to be separated, I really couldn’t focus on work at the start,” said Ms Roslindah, who declined to be photographed for this article. \nWhile her mother initially helped to take care of her daughter while she was working, she eventually sought out childcare options once her daughter was around four years old as her mother had health problems.\nFinancial issues aside, Ms Roslindah was also unprepared for the negative comments she received as a single mum.\nPeople she knew and considered friends would say things like “I don’t think you can make it as a single parent” and “you will only be trouble to your parents, family, friends”.\nShe has since learnt to brush off such comments. \n“I know a lot of negativity will be out there. I want to think positive, because it’s my life, no one is going to stop you or feed you and you have to stand up for yourself,” said Ms Roslindah. \n“Challenges are always there, it’s just that you need to have a brave face and do not ever give up.”\nWhen she started her job at the student care centre, Ms Roslindah said she was not confident about her abilities and second guessed herself since she had no experience in the sector.\nBut she soon decided to bring her experience as a mother and the lessons she has learnt over the years as a parent into the classroom.\nHer hard work has been rewarded with the “Extra Mile” award from her employer, which she obtained last year for her good attendance and the way she has interacted with the students in her care. \nWhile she was aware of the odds being stacked against her to enter this field, Ms Roslindah said she never gave up on the dream and was just waiting patiently for the right opportunity.\n“At last, I’ve achieved the goal. Even without a (higher education) certificate, I’ve achieved it. I didn’t think it was possible. It’s tiring, but I enjoy it,” she said. \nShe now hopes to upgrade her skills and take courses so that she will one day be able to look after younger children in a childcare setting.\nHer other goal is to puchase a three-room flat so that her daughter, who recently graduated from Institute of Technical Education with a higher Nitec certificate in Passenger Services, can have a room of her own.\n\nHer daughter, Nish, she said, wants to become a Singapore Airlines stewardess or further her education at a polytechnic. \n\"She told me ‘Mommy, you don’t have to work, let me stabilise work for one year and then I’ll support you and make you have a comfortable life’,” Ms Roslindah said with a laugh.\nHer 20-year-old daughter said she was filled with joy to see her mother pursue her passion and make a positive impact on other children’s lives — the same way she did in her own life.  \nWhen asked what she wanted to say to her mother, Nish said: “I want to express my deepest gratitude to my mom for her unconditional love, endless support, and tireless sacrifices.\n\"Thank you for being my rock and my inspiration.\""

            "Article Body": "This Mother's Day, TODAY speaks to three mothers each facing their own unique challenges when it comes to parenthood. From a mother of autistic twin boys to a single mother who put her dreams on hold, we look at the resilience and love of these mothers who choose to put their children first.\nSINGAPORE — Even after learning that her pregnancy would a complicated one that involved several risk factors, Madam Lim Pei Hoon cared only about one thing.\nShe wanted her twin boys delivered safe and healthy.\n\"I was already mentally prepared about my sons possibly getting autism so I was only afraid that they would die in the womb,\" Mdm Lim, 39, told TODAY.\nShe had a complicated birth at 30 weeks with doctors having to deliver her twins by Cesarean section as there was a size difference of more than 20 per cent between her two boys. A normal pregnancy is about 40 weeks.\nThe doctors had also found that one of the boys had an abnormal heart arch when scanning the blood flow.\nDespite all this uncertainty, the boys were delivered without further issues arising, and Mdm Lim stayed in the hospital for three days after the delivery.\nThe older twin, Hao Zheng weighed just 1.04kg, while the youngest Hao Ping was slightly bigger at 1.4kg.\nHer twins were diagnosed with autism after they took tests in the hospital and she was able to seek assistance on how to care for them soon after with the hospital's early intervention services. \n\"The boys are placed in different schools though, as they had taken an IQ test and scored differently,\" said Mdm Lim, who has no other children.\nAs a full-time working mother, Mdm Lim had ensured that her now eight-year-old sons were well taken care of throughout the day by sending them to after-school care programmes such as MINDS Raintree Special Student Care Centre at Fernvale Gardens School, and tapping on her family members to look after them. \nBut, she soon realised that her schedule had not afforded her enough time to be with her children and that it had also taken a toll on the wellbeing of the two boys.\n\"When I return home, it is already quite late for them especially when they have to wake up early to go to school, but they have to wait up for me in order to tuck them into bed and coax them to sleep,\" she said.\nShe knew that the arrangement was having some impact on her children, but the full extent became clear only when their teachers would send her photographs of the boys sleeping in class or while they were meant to be eating.\nThe teachers had also spoken with her, suggesting a possible change to her job. This prompted her to make a change from working full-time to part-time.\nAs she worked in the retail industry, Mdm Lim discussed the situation with her boss who later helped to arrange her hours so that she could finish her shift in the evening around 6pm.\nOne other reason why Mdm Lim wanted to make the switch to part-time was so that she could alleviate her husband's stress from having to look after the children while she is not home.\n\"My husband has to work even after he comes home and the boys would quarrel and fight over things like food,\" she said.\nMdm Lim also mentioned an incident where one of her sons was playing with her husband's mobile phone when a call came in from her husband's boss and client.\nInstead of handing the mobile phone back to her husband, her son \"swiped\" the calls away without telling him.\n\"The next day, my husband got scolded by his boss,\" she said.\nSince working part-time for close to a year, Mdm Lim has been able to spend more time with her children. However, the change has come with more financial strains, especially when it comes to medical bills.\n\"When the boys get sick, both of them don't want to take their medicine so then the virus will start to spread amongst the family, resulting in everyone falling sick,\" said Mdm Lim.\nShe added that when this happens, her entire family might need to take multiple trips to the clinic before going to the hospital, if the general practitioner's medicine does not work.\nMdm Lim said that the boys would sometimes have to be hospitalised for three to four days due to the viral infection and high fever. They would also be required to be placed on drips to ensure that they are sufficiently hydrated and able to take their medication.\nThese additional medical bills, in addition to her other financial commitments such as insurance and her children's school fees, have made it challenging for her to make payments on time.\nEven though she struggles financially, Mdm Lim said that she would always prioritise anything to do with her children, ensuring that their needs are paid for on time while she prolongs the payment for other things.\n\"I would always tell my husband, both the insurance and school fees will need to be paid promptly, other payments that can be dragged, we will drag,\" she said.\nIn order to help save wherever she could, Mdm Lim also resorted to skimping on new clothes for herself even when she requires them.\n\"My husband will often say that I wear my clothes even though they have holes in them but I will tell him that I still can wear them,\" she said.\nShe shared that she only decided to purchase a new dress for S$20 from Shopee after her husband's constant nagging but even then, she bought a dress that would last.\nWhile she would say that she had done enough research to be mentally prepared to care for two autistic boys, Mdm Lim said that she had to learn patience when caring for them.\n\"It's hard to handle them especially my oldest son who often throws things when he loses his temper,\" she said.\nMdm Lim recounted a time where her son threw his teddy bear and water bottle out the window when it was raining, and would later cry to ask her for help because his things were downstairs.\nAlthough her youngest son does not lose his temper in the same way, Mdm Lim said that he had a tendency to model after his brother.\n\"One time I caught him when he was about to throw his teddy bear out the window and I said if you throw it downstairs, I will make sure you can't find your teddy bear,\" she said.\nShe added that the scenario where patience is especially needed was when she had to deal with the boys when they fought.\n\"I have a lot of methods. One is to separate the two of them, another is to confiscate their phones and make them count loudly from one to 20,\" Mdm Lim said.\nOne other method she used was to ask if they \"want mummy's knuckle\", where she would playfully use her knuckle to tickle their foot, which she said would often end in laughter and peace between the two brothers.\nEven though Mdm Lim has encountered days where she would get angry with the boys, she said that it is always difficult to stay angry at her sons, especially when they smile and call her \"mummy\".\n\"When I see them like that, it melts my heart and I just cannot be angry with them anymore.\""

            "Article Body": "This Mother's Day, TODAY speaks to three mothers each facing their own unique challenges when it comes to parenthood. From a mother of autistic twin boys to a single mother who put her dreams on hold, we look at the resilience and love of these mothers who choose to put their children first.\n \nSINGAPORE — The memory of being \"abandoned\" by her mother to a guardian during her childhood is still vivid even now for 26-year-old Cynthia Ong.\nRecalling the incident that has been seared in her mind, Ms Ong said that after her parents divorced when she was seven and her mother won custody of her, her mother dropped her off at a family friend’s house one day.\n“And then she didn’t come back,” Ms Ong told TODAY. Her mother simply told her at the time that she needed to go off and buy something — and did not return until a month later.\nThat then became the routine: Her mother would show up just once a month. \n“I asked her where she went and she said she was busy working. She picked me up on some weekends to go out and I always told her that I didn’t want to go back (to the guardian’s house). \n“She thought I was just throwing tantrums,” Ms Ong said.\n“The guardian was abusive, too. The family didn’t send me to school. I had to take my meals outside the house, so I had to stand and eat. I could go back in only after I had finished my food.”\nA year later from the first day she was dropped off at the guardian's house, Ms Ong’s mum realised the seriousness of the situation when she got a call from her daughter's registered primary school, saying that she had not attended classes.\nMs Ong later moved into a rental flat, where she lived with her mother until she was 13, before eventually moving in with her father and brother, who is six years younger. \nToday, Ms Ong is a sales and marketing executive and a mother of two boys who are four and three years old. \nAnd on her most tired days — between handling a full-time job and caring for two children without hired help in the form of a domestic worker — she cannot imagine being separated from her children for unspecified long periods or letting them experience what she went through as a child.\nShe has vowed not to be like her mother.\nWithout a close relationship with her mother and no longer in contact with her, Ms Ong said that she had no one in the family to turn to when she became a parent.\nThis was especially when she was having pregnancy pains and recuperating during the confinement period after birth. \nLater, in finding ways to cope with burnout and frustrated with feeling alone, she began filming videos of herself last July and posting them on video-sharing application TikTok under the handle \"@tiredgenzmom\". \nHoping to get some connection with other parents, Ms Ong began posting about her evening routine as a working mum, cleaning up the house and having playtime with the children. \nShe did the \"Day in My Life\" vlogs on TikTok, a trend that gained popularity two years ago, documenting her life before and after work and how she and her husband spend time with the children. \n\"After the kids go to sleep at 10pm, I have two to three hours of 'me time'... That's when I'll find some time to edit my videos,\" she said. \nThe responses were mostly positive, with some users voicing their support for her. Others wrote to say that it was nice to see a fellow mother having similar routines as them.\nMs Ong finds it comforting that people are able to relate to her experiences as a working mother in Singapore.\n“They can come and talk about their tiredness and experience of being a mum. I hope they see my content and think, ‘Eh, there are also mums going through this. I’m not alone’.\n“The ultimate goal is to bring together a community of mums who feel this is their safe space.\" \nRight now, she has more than 35,000 followers on TikTok watching videos of her everyday life, which are published on her account once every two to four days. \nIn one video, a TikTok user commented: “Y’all look like such cool parents. It makes me feel like I want to have kids, too.”\nAnother one said: \"Wow... you got energy to clean till 1230am. Salute you, mummy.\"\nHer most viral video, posted in March, now has more than 2.3 million views.\nIt shows her returning home on a Friday at around 6.30pm, then showering her sons when they got home, having dinner that was delivered to their flat, going out as a family of four to buy groceries, going home to eat waffles that they had bought and getting some playtime in, putting her children to sleep, putting away cleaned laundry and then her own bedtime at around midnight.\nMs Ong said that she was surprised by the reactions she got to her videos. “You know, the content that I film, I think much of them are almost identical, just that I’m wearing different clothes every day. \n“I think because of my account name (a tired Gen Z mum), a lot of my viewers are Gen Zers who are curious. They’ll tell me that my life is ‘very cool’ and that they also want to be like me when they become a mum one day,” she added, saying that these comments warm her heart.\nAs for concerns of \"sharenting\", or over-sharing her parenting experience online and compromising the safety and privacy of her young children, she said: \"I am very conscious of what I post about them. I don't talk about their names, about the location of their schools and I don't show them when they are throwing tantrums and not feeling their best.\"\nComing from a broken family and having spent most of her childhood and adolescence split between her parents’ homes, Ms Ong has a clear vision of the parent she aspires to be and the level of attentiveness she intends to offer her children.\n“I will always tell myself that I’ll never, ever let my children go through what I did.” \nOn her decision to be a young parent — she got married at the age of 21 and had her first child at 22 — she said: “Some people found it odd that I would choose to have kids after having a difficult childhood. But to me, I want to have a loving family for myself because this was something I never had.” \nMs Ong added that it was her dream to embrace motherhood at a young age, because she wanted to have the energy to actively engage and play with her children during their formative years.\nAnd when they grow older, she envisions herself becoming a \"cool mum\" figure, fostering a relationship with her children that is characterised by open communication and friendship.\nMs Ong likes to think that her parenting style is somewhere in between Asian parenting and gentle parenting. \nAsian parenting takes on an authoritarian approach, often enforcing strict rules and punishment for wrongdoings. Gentle parenting prioritises empathy and positive discipline techniques such as problem-solving together as a family.\n“I try my best to find a balance,\" Ms Ong said. \"If they do something wrong, I will talk to them to make them understand what I’m saying and give them three chances.\n“If they still do it after three times, then I know they’re trying to be funny, and only then will I scold them and discipline them.” \nShe admitted that managing her emotions can be tough on some days due to work stress and fatigue. \nAt the same time, she is acutely aware of how a parent's strong and uncontrolled emotions can become a lasting bad memory to children, just like how some painful parts of her own childhood remain clear as day in her mind today.\n“Because of this, I have to exercise a lot of self-control and regulate my emotions constantly. I don’t want to go to sleep regretting what I did to my kids.”\nMs Ong remembered that when she was dating Mr Nicholas Tan — now her husband — and told him that she wanted to be a mother early, he was a little surprised.\n“He likes to plan things first before doing them. At first, he told me we should wait a while before having our first child.\n“But to me, there is never a right time. We can wait a few years, but maybe there will be other reasons to tell ourselves that we should wait longer. So I convinced him we should do it as soon as possible.” \nMr Tan eventually agreed with his wife since he also likes children and wanted to become a father. \nThe 31-year-old sales manager of a car rental company told TODAY: \"It's more of a mutual decision rather than giving in (to my wife). I also see the benefits of being still 'young' when our children are 18.\"\nMs Ong said that as a young parent, she does not feel like she is missing out on anything as someone in her 20s.\nOn the contrary, she feels like her life has a purpose now. \n“When I was younger, we never officially celebrated Mother’s Day or such commemorative days, even though I really wanted family time. My brother and I were always on our own. \n“Today, I have two sons and they're the reason I work so hard.\n\"They keep me motivated and I constantly want to be a better version of myself.\n\"If I were given a chance to go back in time, I would still choose to be a young mum. I have no regrets.” "

            "Article Body": "Warning: This article discusses self-harm and suicide.\nSINGAPORE — I have a friend who tends to express her thoughts quite openly about not wanting to live. If you don’t know her well, some things can be shocking to hear at first.  \nShe would say, for instance: “I wish I’d get hit by a car.” Or, “Life is meaningless. Why was I even born?”. Or, “I wouldn’t mind not waking up forever”.\nThese utterances would come up whenever she finds herself in a tough spot. \nSince I have known her for almost seven years now, I would say that I have become \"immune\" to her morbid expressions, which are sometimes said in a casual, lighthearted tone. \nCould she be joking? Even if so, it does not mean that I am less worried about her state of mind.\nRecent statistics have shown that there is much to be concerned about when it comes to young adults' mental health. In a survey involving 1,000 Singaporeans aged 21 to 74 last October, one in four responents under the age of 35 said that they have seriously considered self-harm or suicide at least once.\nWith all the mental health topics that are being widely covered by the media now, I was introduced to the term \"suicidal ideation\" while browsing through online articles on various mental health trends. \nFrom what I understood, \"suicidal ideation\" means having thoughts about what life would be like after you are dead, as well as your life coming to an end, but not necessarily by suicide. \nImmediately, I thought about my friend because this sounded very much like her. \nI have always wanted to ask her about it, but we are not close enough that I would feel comfortable asking about something so private or personal without feeling intrusive. \nIs my friend suicidal? What is the difference between suicidal ideation and having suicidal thoughts?\nDoes this mean that every time I hear someone (or myself, for that matter) talk about their own death, I should be deeply concerned?  \nTo help answer some of these questions that are troubling me and to find out if my friend needs help beating the blues, I decided to talk to a few psychologists to understand more of what may be going on in her mind. \nDr Annabelle Chow, principal clinical psychologist at Annabelle Psychology, said that suicidal ideation typically refers to, and includes, suicidal thoughts.\nThe term also includes mental images, wishes or ideas of suicide and death.\nShe noted that there are two main forms of suicidal ideation:\n“We might assume that passive suicidal ideation would be less ‘serious’ than the active form. However, this is false and has been disproven in large population studies,” Dr Chow said. \n“Any form of suicidal ideation, passive or active, is a serious concern, and one is not likely to predict a suicide attempt more than another.” \nHearing this, I was reminded of a younger ex-colleague who occasionally used short-form lingo such as \"KMS\" wantonly whenever she messed up or felt stuck. \"KMS\" is short for “kill myself”. \nDr Chow said: “The moments that we tend to use these phrases usually indicate some level of momentary distress, upset, frustration, irritation, humiliation or any other negative emotion that warrants some sense of ‘I’d rather not be alive at this moment to experience what is happening’.\n\"However, I would be hesitant to say that jokes about dying would be an indicator that someone is stressed out about life. It is truly subjective, depending from person to person, and even moment to moment.\"\nMs Janet Gay, a counsellor at mental healthcare company Intellect, said that the key difference lies in the scope and depth of the mental state.\n“On one hand, intense and frequent suicidal ideation can suggest underlying mental health conditions like depression and anxiety. However, it’s important to note that not everyone who experiences suicidal ideation will act on those thoughts.”\nMr James Chong, clinical director of psychotherapy and counselling centre The Lion Mind, echoed these observations. \n“Not everyone who jokes about death or dying is necessarily experiencing suicidal ideation. It could just be their way of dealing with life stressors, just like some individuals would imagine winning a S$10 million lottery,” he said. \nHe added that some people may make light of such a serious topic to seek attention or to test if their social groups are safe to discuss a subject of this nature. \nWhatever the case, Ms Gay's advice was that one may try to better understand the situation by asking the person directly about those comments when they are made. \n“Oftentimes, encouraging open communication and expressing concern in a non-judgmental way can help create a safe space for those around us to share their problems if they are struggling with their mental health,” she said. \nThe three mental health experts interviewed said that suicidal ideation can be triggered by the experience of failures in different phases of life, such as failing a test, not getting the ideal job or internship, not getting a promotion, or failing to close a sale with a highly potential customer. \nRelationships and weddings, too, can on some occasions make one feel ill mentally and emotionally.\nThis is especially the case when one has to meet high expectations from parents, in-laws or relatives when planning a wedding, or when coping with the end of a romantic relationship or a divorce. \nGiven that there is a chance my friend is not suicidal, but that this deduction may be subjective and I am not close enough to yet know what some of the contributory factors that may be weighing on her are, I still have more questions. \nHow can a layman tell the signs of suicidal ideation, be it from themselves or other people? \nMs Gay the counsellor said some warning signs that indicate the need for professional help include:\nIn the view of Dr Chow the clinical psychologist, any indication that someone is experiencing suicidal ideation is enough of a sign that professional help is needed.\n“For most of us, the signs we should try to take notice of are any signs of distress, pain or low mood, change in behaviour or social withdrawal.” \nDr Chow also said that undoubtedly, those who experience chronic or recurrent suicidal ideation are at a \"higher baseline level of risk\". \nIt is also likely that this group of people have struggled, and will continue to struggle, in their relationships with others and themselves. \n“The negative emotions and suicidal thoughts make it difficult for them to experience pleasure and purpose in their lives. Their overall well-being may be consumed by emotional pain and suffering.\n“They may hyperfocus on the challenges they face, their flaws and all the things that are wrong with themselves or the world, and find it hard to see a glimmer of hope or light.” \nAnd when it comes to spotting the signs in ourselves, Mr Chong the counsellor said that one should trust one's instincts and take any concerns from trusted friends or family members seriously. \n“Being familiar with common signs and symptoms of depressive or suicidal tendencies can help us better understand our experiences and make informed decisions about seeking support,” he added. \nDr Chow stressed the importance of offering support to people we know who are at risk, because this would make them feel less isolated and more connected to the people around them. \n“Give them space to express themselves. Listen to their thoughts and feelings without judgement or rushing to ‘solve’ them. Encouraging help-seeking behaviour with professionals is also helpful and should be normalised,” she said. \n“We can also encourage individuals to practise self-care regularly. This involves maintaining our well-being foundations by eating nutritious foods, getting healthy sleep and exercising regularly.\n\"Other self-care activities include participating in hobbies and practising gratitude and self-compassion.” \nMr Chong said that people with past traumas can be referred to counselling and psychotherapy to equip them with effective practical coping skills. \n“Evidence-based psychotherapy such as cognitive behaviour therapy can help individuals develop healthier ways of managing their distress.\n“In addition to therapy, encouraging individuals to engage in social activities such as physical sports that may be jogging and cycling can foster feelings of inclusion and significance,” he suggested. \nAt the end of the day, all three experts agreed that early intervention is key. \n“If you notice that you have self-harming thoughts that are becoming more frequent, don't wait. Call a helpline or schedule a session with a counsellor or psychologist,” Ms Gay said. \n“The more we talk about it, the more we are aware of how it affects us. This then allows us to choose different behaviours to do or thoughts to think.\nSharing an insight she gleaned from a company course, Ms Gay said that contrary to popular belief, it is okay to ask someone if he or she has suicidal ideation. \n“This will not plant the idea in their heads or encourage them to do it. Rather, it opens up a safe space for someone to speak candidly about their mental health, which can provide relief and assist them in seeing alternative ways out of their situation.” \nIf you, or anyone you know, might want to talk to someone, you can reach out to one of the helplines below. \nYouthline: +65 6436 6612 (call), +65 8533 9460 (text) and over email at hello@youthline.sg. \nYouthline is dedicated to people up to 35 years old and provides free mental health support to youth via phone, email or a live-chat service.

            "Article Summary": "A recent survey by government agency SkillsFuture Singapore found that the percentage of fresh graduates from private education institutions here who found jobs within six months has fallen .\nTODAY spoke to three graduates from three private institutions about why they chose this education path despite knowing it was considered \"less prestigious\"  .\nThe graduates said that private education universities provide flexibility, hands-on learning and double degree courses unavailable in other universities.\nThey also said the ability to graduate faster puts them in good stead to gain more work experience to catch up pay-wise with their peers in other universities",
            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — Graduates from private education institutions are well aware of the stigma they might face while looking for a job — some employers deem their degree as \"less prestigious\" and tend to view them as individuals who \"cannot study\".  \nYet they continue to pursue such degrees despite the salary gap being \"slightly depressing\", with around 9,100 students completing full-time bachelor's level external degree programmes across 26 private education institutions between May 2022 and April 2023.  \nA recent survey by government agency SkillsFuture Singapore also found that the percentage of fresh graduates from private education institutions here who found jobs within six months fell from 86.5 to 83.2 per cent between the 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 cohorts.\nGraduates from such institutions also continued to earn less than their counterparts in Singapore universities such as the National University of Singapore (NUS) and Nanyang Technological University (NTU), drawing a median gross monthly salary of S$3,400 for full-time permanent employment, or around S$900 less.\nTODAY spoke to three graduates from private education universities on why they decided to go down this educational route despite knowing the challenges that they would face after graduation.  \nFor 25-year-old Alecander Ong, studying at a private university was certainly not his first choice, but he ended up doing so because his grades “weren’t the best” after graduating from Singapore Polytechnic with a grade point average of around 2.5. \n“Growing up, every parent would say you have to go to a Singapore university at least.\n\"There was the stigma of ‘if you don’t go to a Singapore university, means you’re a bit dumb-dumb, cannot study’,\" Mr Ong said.\nHe graduated in February with a management and marketing degree at Curtin Singapore (under its parent university in Australia) after an 18-month course.\nHe recalled that he also felt tentative at first about telling people where he was studying when asked. \n“The perception on any resume, if you see someone comes from NUS, NTU... definitely, they still get more recognition. When you say, ‘Oh, I’m from a private university', the next question people will ask is, ‘Where is that?’.” \nUnlike Singapore's universities that have built up relationships with companies over the years and have an extensive database of places where NTU and NUS students may go to for internships, he said, Curtin Singapore does not have that same relationship with businesses.\nSo although he was given the option of doing an internship for his final trimester instead of a management module, Mr Ong had to look for an internship himself.\nKnowing that finding a job may be more “strenuous and tough”, he sent out close to 50 applications on networking site Linkedin, 20 emails directly to companies and attended multiple interviews to look for an internship opportunity that could convert to full-time employment.\nHe managed to land an internship in a public relations firm after what he called a \"very intensive\" month-long search. The firm offered him a full-time role as an account executive towards the end of his internship period.\nThough the reported pay gap between private institution graduates and Singapore university graduates is “slightly depressing”, Mr Ong believes that it is only a matter of time before the gap narrows in the course of one's career if one has the drive and determination.  \nEven though a private university degree has its limits in terms of brand recognition and campus life, Mr Ong said that the experience was beneficial because it allowed him to interact with mostly international students and instructors without needing to head overseas. \nAnother highlight was learning more niche subjects that may not be as common in Singaporean universities. These were modules that comprised topics on indigenous rights, sustainable development and cultural communication.\n“Ultimately, it really doesn’t matter because it’s just a paper. You can also have people from NUS and private education institutions who may not be as hardworking as those with an ITE (Institute of Technical Education) certificate.\n\"It’s just a paper until you actively contribute and do something that proves your worth.”\nMs Nurul Jalil, 31, was brought up to believe that Singapore universities were the way to go, but a private education institution eventually became her top choice because it allowed her to balance both work and her studies.\nHer search for a flexible study option led her to a bachelor of arts degree from Australia's Murdoch University, received through private education operator Kaplan. Her course was anchored on public relations and tourism and events management, which allowed her to pursue a degree “efficiently”.\n“Time is super valuable to me. If I had gone with a Singapore university, it would have meant investing four long years, whereas the private education option allowed me to wrap up my double degree in just 18 months,” Ms Nurul said.\nThe night classes, which took place from 7pm to 10pm on weekdays, allowed her continue her full-time job as a social media manager before she graduated in 2019.\nThough her family's financial circumstances led her to enter the workforce early and put her dream of studying in Australia on pause, Kaplan gave her the opportunity to have her graduation in Perth. \nThe private university route also appealed to her because it offered the chance to explore her diverse interests through a double major that was not available at Singapore's universities. \nHowever, paying for her education entirely on her own was no mean feat, given the limited subsidies and financial aid available for private education candidates.\nStill, Ms Nurul said that it was a \"worth it\" investment because she has learnt more about the tourism industry, which in turn has helped her freelance work as a food and travel blogger at Explore To Makan, a blog catered to Muslim travellers.\nHer full-time job now is with technology firm Bitsmedia, where she is a search engine optimisation and content marketing specialist. \nGiven the practical work experience and the rigour of the course she underwent, it is disappointing even today for her to see the favouritism shown towards graduates from Singapore's autonomous universities.\n\nMs Nurul said that she has been deterred from applying for jobs where it is listed that the employer requires applicants to have a “minimum degree from a local university” or “recognised university” in their job descriptions. \n“There’s often a perception that autonomous universities are seen as more prestigious and rigorous compared to private education institutions, which can influence employability and pay,” she added. \nShe also said that although university rankings and academic credentials are important, they do not guarantee a candidate’s aptitude for their job, because practical skills and hands-on experience are “equally, if not more valuable”. \n“Balancing a full-time job with a part-time degree demonstrates strong time management skills,” Ms Nurul asserted. \n“If an employer discriminates based solely on academic qualifications, it’s not a company I’d choose to work for.”\nUnlike some of his peers, Mr Shawn Tan, 24, had a “smooth” job search experience landing a full-time position in his final trimester at private education institution PSB Academy, which he graduated from in April this year.\nHolding a bachelor of science degree in cyber security, he is now a support engineer for a consultancy that makes cloud solutions. He leveraged the connections he made during his 18-month degree programme and used his industry-specific knowledge to impress future employers. \nIn his course, he was able to do industry-relevant modules on cybersecurity incident detection, which taught him how to use a software programme that is what he uses in his current job role. \nThe institution's ties with cybersecurity industry partners through guest lectures, workshops and events also helped him make connections with potential employers and get more familiar with trends in his field.\nMr Tan decided that the private education university route was best suited for him since he was more of a \"hands-on\" learner and it would allow him to enter the workforce faster. \nAs the trimester system with limited breaks provided a more intensive degree course, he found a “steady rhythm” in his studies, completing 12 modules a year instead of the eight modules most autonomous university students finish in the same time period. \nThough he is aware that some private institution graduates may take a longer time to attain full-time employment in the field of their choice as compared to Singapore university graduates, he said that private university graduates enter the workforce earlier. \n“By the time our autonomous university peers complete their degree programmes, we private university grads would have gained a substantial amount of work experience by at least one year even if the initial securing of a job for some people takes a little longer,” Mr Tan added.\nAnother plus point of his course was the diversity of his cohort. \n\n“I had the opportunity to collaborate with peers from diverse backgrounds, including those of different ages, professional experiences and nationalities.\n\n\"It was different from my time at polytechnic. Whenever I faced challenges with assignments, my classmates were always willing to help, creating a collaborative and supportive learning environment.\""

            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — The promise of a European Union (EU) citizenship and a better life for her 12-year-old son was enough for one domestic worker in Singapore to part with S$2,500 of her life savings to a recruitment agency in Singapore in 2022. \nThe agency promised to help her get a work permit and an official visa from the Polish embassy. The plan would then be to work as a cleaner at a factory in Poland for five years, apply to be a permanent resident there, then start a new life with her son in central Europe.\nThat plan never materialised. \nAlthough the agency assured the domestic worker back in 2022 that her work permit would arrive in four to six months, nearly two years have passed without any progress. \nShe eventually asked for a refund, but was denied. Like other migrant workers interviewed by TODAY, she spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal from the agency and her current employers.\nShe said: “I feel very sad. It’s like you throw S$2,500 into the trash bin.” She is still hoping to find another route to Europe, but said that her main concern now is simply to get her money back.\nTODAY spoke to her and three other migrant workers in Singapore who went through a similar experience with the same recruitment agency, Global Recruiters.\nTODAY has reached out to Global Recruiters, but its managing director has declined multiple requests for an interview.\nOrganisations championing migrant worker rights said that they have received several complaints about Global Recruiters and other organisations that offer this same service.\nThe Humanitarian Organization for Migration Economics (Home) said that they typically receive around 10 complaints from migrant workers each year related to this matter.\nTransient Workers Count Too (TWC2) said that five migrant workers approached them regarding this same issue last year. \n\"It is appalling to hear of these agencies targeting low-wage migrant workers, where the workers are offered false hope of a better working life only for their savings to be robbed,” Home said.\n“Migrant workers are incredibly dependent on intermediaries and thus will continue to be highly vulnerable to questionable business practices.\"\nHome added that it hopes law enforcement agencies will strengthen transnational cooperation to crack down on “networks that prey on the vulnerable and financially desperate”, and that there will be increased transparency in recruitment regimes for migrant workers. \nIn response to TODAY’s queries, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said that it is looking into two fee-related complaints filed against Global Recruiters in June last year and investigations are ongoing.\nThe police here have also confirmed that reports against Global Recruiters have been made and that they are investigating.\nIn April 2019, Global Recruiters created a Facebook page called “Pinoys to Poland” and posted a message stating that it was recruiting English-speaking Filipinos for Polish housekeeping jobs.\nThe sales pitch to these migrant workers was simple: For a fee of around S$2,000, the company said that it would offer support for the applicant’s work permit, visa application and job placement in Poland. \nOnce they had worked there for five years, they would be able to apply for permanent residency that, if approved, would allow them to invite their family members over to Poland to live under a family reunification visa.\nPermanent residents there would also be able to tap the country’s free education system and apply to be a Polish citizen, among other benefits. \nThese benefits are accurate, as stated in both Polish and EU regulations. However, whether recruitment agencies are able to help migrants attain them is another matter.\nThe Facebook group attracted the attention of migrant workers of other nationalities who are working in Singapore.\nFor John (not his real name), a South Asian worker in his 30s who has worked here since the early 2010s, the appeal of Global Recruiters’ offer was the opportunity to start his life anew as a citizen in another country with his family.\n“Singapore is a very good country. Thirteen years I (have) lived here, but even if I stay another 10 years…  I cannot progress to (attain an) S-Pass or bring my family over (here),” he said, referring to the S-Pass that is issued by MOM to eligible skilled workers earning a salary of at least $3,150. \nHe has paid a total of S$3,500 to the recruitment agency over two years.\nHe was refused a refund on the grounds that all the money paid had already been spent on his work permit and visa applications. \nBased on checks online, the cost of applying for a work permit in Poland for foreigners is 100 zloty (S$34), and the cost of obtaining a long-term Polish visa is about S$120. \nTODAY understands that there are at least 20 other migrant workers of various nationalities who have paid for the agency’s services to secure a job in Poland, but they are still on Singapore soil. They have been waiting anywhere between one and more than three years.\nThe address listed on the “Pinoys to Poland” Facebook page is a unit in Lucky Plaza shopping centre. The unit was shut when TODAY visited the premises on two occasions this week, with the signboard above its entrance indicating that it is a pharmacy. \nLucky Plaza’s store directory listed Global Recruiters in a different unit on the same floor, but that unit was empty of furniture.\nAll four migrant workers who spoke to TODAY said that it was common for them to receive assurances from the agency that their work permits or visas were “coming soon”, only for these to be followed by months of radio silence. \nIn the terms of a “consultancy agreement” that all four migrant workers signed with Global Recruiters that were seen by TODAY, the company indicated that it “cannot be held liable for any WP (work permit) application delays or rejection”.\nThe agreement also states that “applicants will not be allowed to cancel an application once the application is made”, and that agency fees paid to Global Recruiters will be forfeited if an applicant is “unable to continue”.\nJohn and another migrant worker said that they had held out hope for many months because they knew of one previous applicant who had managed to go to Poland with Global Recruiters' help.\nNow, they have since come to believe that the same is not happening for them.\nIn the meantime, some applicants received just a work permit from a provincial government in Poland.\nAdam (not his real name), a migrant worker of South Asian nationality in his 30s, forked out around S$5,000 in payments to the agency over a year, but received only a work permit that expired before he could even get an interview with the Polish embassy in Singapore for a visa.\nHe told TODAY that he earns just slightly more than S$1,000 a month and is the sole breadwinner for his wife and two-year-old daughter. He added that his wife had to sell the cattle her family owned in order to pay for the agency’s fees back in 2021.\n“I am very sad and depressed,” he said. \nThe workers interviewed by TODAY said that when they raised complaints with Global Recruiters or spoke about legal action, they had received threats in return.\nOne was told that their employer would be contacted. In another instance, Global Recruiters filed a complaint at the Small Claims Tribunal against the worker, but then did not send a representative to the hearing, so the case was dismissed.\nMigrant workers’ rights group TWC2 said that it offered legal assistance to the second worker.\nMOM told TODAY that under the Employment Agencies Act 1958, organisations and individuals who place jobseekers with employers within or outside of Singapore must obtain an employment agency licence to operate in Singapore.\n“Jobseekers are reminded that they should not pay fees to their employment agencies until they are successfully emplaced with an employer,” MOM added. \nGlobal Recruiters is listed as a licensed employment agency, as seen on MOM’s online employment agency directory at the time of publication. \nAll of this has been happening while Poland is mired in an immigration corruption scandal.\nIn September last year, Polish media published reports alleging that Polish officials in Warsaw and abroad had fast-tracked work visas for non-EU migrant workers in developing countries in exchange for sums of money up to US$5,000 (S$6,800).\nIn Eurostat data provided by Rzeczpospolita, a Polish news daily, Poland issued almost two million work visas from 2020 to 2023. These include 600,000 in 2020, more than a quarter of the total in the 27-member EU that year. \nPoland’s foreign ministry said in September last year that it would terminate all contracts for outsourcing companies that had handled visa applications since 2011, British news channel BBC reported. \nFor the migrant workers in Singapore who find themselves stuck in a situation being driven by forces far beyond their control, the only thing that matters now is getting their hard-earned money back.\nJohn said: \"If you spend money on something, of course you want (some) benefits, right? If (they) really can't do anything, then (they should) return back my money.\n\"This was a very big mistake in my life.\" "

            "Article Body": "Please be advised that the articles delve into topics and accounts of trauma and abuse that may be triggering to the reader.\nSINGAPORE — For victims of childhood trauma, letting go of resentment, anger or even hatred towards the people who have hurt them and inflicted deep wounds can be incredibly difficult.\nYet, some people have found healing by practising forgiveness — mainly because they did not want to carry the burden anymore or because they did not want to make bad decisions or mistakes in life choices while being vulnerable or unstable mentally and emotionally.\nForgiving her abuser, for example, helped 39-year-old Sharon Khoo heal and step away from her painful past.\nAs a child, Mrs Khoo endured years of physical and emotional abuse by her father, and had no one to turn to as her mother tried to hush up the domestic violence.\nThe traumatic experiences left a profound impact on her mental health during her teenage and young adult years, leading to multiple suicide attempts and self-inflicted harm.\nReflecting on how holding on to anger and bitterness had made her a “bitter rage monster”, Mrs Khoo later realised that forgiveness was the only path to recovery.\n“My logical and adult mind said, ‘It’s better you don’t maintain any connections (with your father)’.\n“(But) I didn’t want to be a slave or prisoner to my bitterness anymore,” she said.\nMental health experts told TODAY that forgiveness remains a deeply personal choice, but it can be an important part of the healing process for many people who have had adverse childhood experiences.\nThe term “adverse childhood experience” refers to a potentially traumatic situation or event that a person may face or witness while growing up.\nDr Lim Boon Leng, a psychiatrist at Dr BL Lim Centre for Psychological Wellness, highlighted that the term “forgiveness” may imply reconciling with the offender and making peace with the person, but the interpretation in the psychology field differs.\n“In the psychological context, forgiveness denotes an intentional decision to let go of resentment and anger, and in doing so, sealing off a past wrongdoing and removing it from the present,” he said.\nCrucial to forgiveness is accepting that the past experiences happened, and there is a deliberate effort to relinquish anger and stop the self-blame.\n“It also involves a commitment to moving forward and focusing on the present moment,” he added. \nBesides reducing the impact of past traumas and the symptoms of depression and anxiety, practising forgiveness can protect against intergenerational trauma, research showed.\nIntergenerational trauma occurs when victims of trauma repeat the patterns of abuse or violence within the family and expose their children to similar adversities.\nIn a study published in the Journal of Child and Adolescent Trauma in last December, researchers found that forgiveness is the “one personal protective factor that may disrupt the intergenerational transmission of adverse childhood experiences” and that this factor “is entirely within an individual’s control”.\nBased on a study of 150 parents and children combined, analyses revealed that if a parent had a higher number of adverse childhood experiences, this person’s child was likely to have a higher number of similar experiences.\nHowever, forgiveness seemed to weaken this connection, which led the researchers to hypothesise that “parents who showed higher levels of forgiveness of others and self-forgiveness would show a lesser tendency to pass adverse childhood experiences on to their children”.\nForgiveness is also good for the heart, literally.\nPast research has shown that the deliberate decision to forgive is linked to a lower risk of a heart attack, reduced cholesterol levels and risk of other cardiovascular diseases.\nOn the other hand, people who are unable to forgive and let go may end up hurting themselves.\nThat is because one of the psychological effects of holding on to grudges and resentment is increased stress and anxiety, which triggers the body’s stress response when prolonged, Dr BL Lim explained.\n“Holding onto deep-seated anger and resentment can be a contributing factor for the development of mental health disorders such as anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive disorders and personality disorders,” he said.\nPersistent resentment can also lead to mistrust, conflict and isolation, making it difficult to form or maintain close relationships, he added.\nThe experts emphasised that forgiveness does not necessarily mean reconciliation.\nIt certainly does not mean condoning and excusing the wrongful behaviour that had happened.\n“It is important to note that forgiveness is a personal journey and does not necessarily mean forgetting the events or fully reconciling with the offenders,” Dr Lim said.\nThe idea that doing so is “virtuous can be a burdensome misconception” for people who have been wronged, he added.\n“Often, the inability to reconcile with the offender or treat them kindly can lead to feelings of guilt and self-criticism. This may in turn perpetuate distress associated with the wrongdoing, rather than alleviate it.”\nIn some instances, forgiveness may not be feasible or healthy, especially during or immediately after harm has been done.\nIn other cases, emotions such as anger following a traumatic incident can sometimes serve as a catalyst for necessary action.\n“For instance, a teenager experiencing ongoing physical abuse might harness their anger to stand up and refuse (to take) further abuse.\n“Prematurely forgiving the abuser who shows no change in behaviour or remorse can potentially lead to further psychological harm.\n“In such cases, it is crucial to prioritise personal safety and emotional health over forgiveness,” Dr Lim said.\nIf the person persists in the hurtful behaviour despite being forgiven, it is advisable to set clear boundaries to safeguard one’s well-being. In such cases, it may be necessary to even end the relationship, Dr Lim added.\n“Forgiveness in this context doesn’t require one to stay in a harmful situation, but to find peace with the past while making healthy choices about the future.\n“It’s the ability to love oneself despite these traumas, to put yourself first and live life to the fullest.”\nThe popular saying of “to forgive and forget” is often too simplistic, and does not take into account the complexities involved in the emotional process of forgiveness, the experts cautioned.\nDr John Lim, chief well-being officer at private service provider Singapore Counselling Centre, acknowledged that forgiving someone who has hurt you can be tough.\n“Trust may have been broken, and there might be a profound sense of injustice and betrayal,” he said.\n“The process involves not just excusing someone’s actions but finding a way to live with the impact of those actions — without letting them control one’s emotional well-being.”\nHe also said that erasing memories of hurtful experiences is not always necessary for “true forgiveness” to take place.\n“It’s about releasing those memories from one’s grip so that one can go on living without holding grudges.\n“Recalling (past hurts or traumatic experiences) can be a process of learning that can aid the person in future boundary-setting and healthier decision-making,” he added.\nConversely, suppressing those memories may interfere with the emotional processing that is required for healing. \nDr BL Lim said: “Often, the healing process includes deliberate exposure to the memories within the safety of therapy.”\nEveryone has a unique recovery journey, so everyone’s path to healing is different, and forgiving someone is a personal choice that cannot be rushed or prescribed, Dr John Lim said.\nHowever, there are some practices that can aid in the healing process.\nDr BL Lim said that therapy and counselling can provide a safe space for people to understand and process traumatic experiences.\nIn therapy, techniques such as cognitive behavioural therapy, dialectical behaviour therapy, and eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing, also known as EMDR, are used.\nThey can help people reframe negative thoughts, work through trauma and develop healthier emotional responses.\n“Forgiveness unfolds over time and requires acknowledging and working through complex emotions.\n“Individual therapy offers a supportive environment to delve into these emotions safely.\n“It facilitates a deeper understanding of one’s feelings and can open doors to forgiveness, helping people navigate their path towards healing more effectively,” Dr BL Lim said.\nIn addition to therapy, cultivating self-compassion and mindfulness is crucial for those who have experienced trauma.\nSimilar to mindfulness, embracing forgiveness is something that can be practised.\nThe mental health experts suggested ways to develop a more forgiving attitude: \nDr John Lim from the Singapore Counselling Centre said it is important to recognise that healing is possible regardless of whether there is forgiveness.\n“Healing is an extremely private process… For some, (forgiveness) is not a prerequisite for moving on and finding peace,” he added.\n“Focusing on self-compassion, seeking support from trustworthy people or professionals, and engaging in healing practices can be instrumental in moving from a place of pain to one of empowerment.”\nIn Mrs Khoo's case, moving towards forgiveness has not been a simple task, but she recognised that she needed it for her own healing.\nShe credited her religious faith as playing a significant role in her decision to forgive and not hold a grudge against her father.  \n“Choosing forgiveness is a choice; it's not just a feeling because if we go by feelings, my human nature says that I don’t want to forgive,” she said. \n“There’s a saying that we often hear. ‘To err is human but to forgive, divine’.\n“Forgiveness is not a human process; it's actually something that you need to work with a higher power to be able to do it.”  \nDespite her father’s apology after the birth of her first child, Mrs Khoo would not consider their relationship fully repaired.\nShe recommended that he sought professional help, but he declined.\nTo ensure the well-being and safety of her family, she has set boundaries and refrains from meeting him in person.\nTo this day, though, she is “keeping the door opened” for the possibility that her father will eventually seek professional support, allowing for a full reconciliation. \nTo people who are seeking forgiveness, Dr BL Lim emphasised that it should involve more than just an apology or seeking reconciliation.\n“It should be an act of restitution whereby the person (who hurt you) genuinely takes responsibility and makes efforts to rectify the wrong done.\n“In the instance where an adult has harmed a child, seeking forgiveness on the adult’s part involves taking full responsibility for the harm caused, offering a sincere apology and making amends through consistent, changed behaviour,” he said.\n- RoundBox@Children's Society (Toa Payoh): 6259 3735 (Mon to Fri, 9am to 6pm)\n- Vox@Children's Society (Chai Chee): 6443 4139 (Mon to Fri, 9am to 6pm)\n- JYC@Children's Society (Jurong): 6566 6989 (Mon, Wed and Fri, 8.45am to 5.45pm)\n- The Fort@Children's Society (Radin Mas): 6276 5077 (Mon to Fri, 8.30am to 5.30pm)\n"

            "Article Summary": "Many young adults in Singapore are under-insured, industry figures showed.\nVarious survey results found that a majority of Gen Z respondents lack coverage for critical illnesses and accidents.\nReasons for under-insurance included a focus on immediate goals, irregular income from non-traditional jobs, and a \"live in the moment\" mindset.\nSome parents would buy insurance for their children but without updating policies, so young adults can still be under-protected.\nInsurers said that closing this gap would require better education, tailored coverage, and engaging young adults through innovative methods",
            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — With a passion for theatre and drama, and having no financial commitments, Mr Leonard Tan decided to “follow his heart” before working towards financial stability. \nOn the upside, the 28-year-old has the freedom to pursue acting and hosting as a freelancer without worrying too much about money beyond his day-to-day expenses.\nOn the flipside, apart from the basic MediShield Life plan provided by the Government's Central Provident Fund Board, he has no insurance coverage should he be hit with an unforeseen turn of events. \nHe told TODAY of his financial priorities: “Financially, I’m not the most comfortable yet. Insurance can be an unnecessary expenditure. What if I never fall ill or get into an accident? Then I’ll be paying for nothing, right?”  \nAsked if he had ever thought about unfortunate events happening to him and what he would do, Mr Tan said that buying insurance is not “totally out of the window” for him and he plans to get insured fairly soon. \n“I know I can’t wait too long because the premiums will get more expensive the older I am. But I'm okay with the current situation. I just hope that nothing happens to me.” \nMr Tan is not alone. A recent TODAY commentary suggested that most young adults in Singapore are under-insured, as there is a clear shift in insurance needs and priorities among millennials and those in Generation Z. \n\nMillennials have been grouped as those born between 1981 and 1996, and Gen Zers as those born from 1997.\nBeing under-insured means that you are not sufficiently covered for unexpected events, leaving you financially vulnerable to paying a significant portion of costs, such as an unforeseen health crisis, out of your own pocket.\nYoung adults are said by some observers to navigate life with a sense of invincibility, and some data supported this view.\nIn a survey last year by insurance firm FWD, more than 68 per cent of Gen Z respondents indicated that they did not have coverage for critical illnesses such as cancer and stroke. \nA survey by Etiqa Insurance indicated that 55 per cent of younger Singaporeans showed low confidence in investing. Another 44 per cent felt the same about having sufficient means to build emergency funds. \nIt is worth noting in passing that both those firms, FWD and Etiqa, make money from selling insurance.\nSeparately, a study by the Life Insurance Association (LIA) showed that the issue of being under-insured is not exclusive to young adults. It reported a critical illness protection gap of 74 per cent, or S$579 billion, for economically active Singaporeans aged between 20 and 69.\nThis means that adequate protection needs amounted to S$783 billion, but the coverage bought was just S$204 billion, resulting in the 74 per cent gap. \nLIA's executive director Chan Wai Kit told TODAY that people aged 25 to 29 possibly have less financial ability to buy the insurance coverage they require and may not recognise the need as much compared to other priorities.\n\"While they may understand the importance of being protected against financial uncertainties, Gen Z faces an ongoing dilemma because that generation of people also want to spend on current experiences that they enjoy such as dining, shopping and travel.\"\nTODAY spoke to several insurance firms and financial consultants to find out whether Gen Zers are significantly different from other age cohorts when it comes to buying insurance policies and what can be done to close the gap. \nMr Raymond Ong, chief executive officer of Etiqa Insurance Singapore, said that several barriers prevent young adults who are still establishing themselves financially from buying insurance.\nThese barriers included economic uncertainty, fluctuations in the job market, and the rising cost of living, he said.\nThe shifting attitudes of Gen Zers towards work and financial planning also added layers of complexity. \n“Gen Zers are more open to non-traditional employment arrangements, such as freelancing or entrepreneurship, which may result in irregular income streams and a lack of employer-sponsored benefits, including insurance coverage.” \nMr Ong also said that there is a perceptible trend among Gen Zers towards embracing a “live in the moment” ethos, which may inadvertently sideline long-term financial considerations such as insurance planning. \n“As they focus on planning for these major purchases, insurance coverage often takes a backseat. This prioritisation of immediate goals over insurance means that their savings are frequently allocated towards these endeavours instead, leaving them under-insured.” \nMr Mark Czajkowski, chief marketing officer of insurer Manulife Singapore, echoed these points.\nHe pointed to a study that the firm ran this year, which showed that \"having sufficient insurance\" ranked eighth in priority in the long-term financial goals of the young adults surveyed. \nOther goals such as saving for emergencies, travel, and home ownership take precedence. \nMs Pamela Chong, associate manager at Legacy FA, a financial advisory firm, said that having a different mindset on family planning was also a contributing factor.  \n“Most Gen Zers may not need to provide for their parents financially, and unless they are married, they may not see the need to get insured at all,” she added. \n“However, it is also worth noting that the trend now is that more of them are getting married later, and a large portion of them may not even want kids after seeing all the various sacrifices that their parents have gone through.” \nAs this mindset slowly becomes the norm among their peers, Ms Chong said that Gen Zers are likely to view paying insurance premiums as a form of liability instead of an asset. \nMr Colin Chan, managing director for marketing at insurer Great Eastern, said that Singaporeans have become more affluent over the generations, so some parents have begun pitching in more to help their children buy insurance. \nLikewise, Mr Ong of Etiqa said that parents of today’s young are more insurance-savvy, such that many young adults may own insurance coverage bought for them during their childhood or schooling years. \nHowever, he said: “Without a comprehensive understanding of the scope and limitations of these policies, young adults may mistakenly assume they have adequate protection and end up under-insured.” \nOne millennial interviewed by TODAY fell into this category.\nAccount manager Eliza Wong, 30, said that she has not bought any personal insurance for herself despite knowing that it is good to acquire some form of protection. \nShe could only vaguely recall being covered by her mother’s extended family plan, which she does not know much about, including what she is insured for and how much. \n“With so many options out there, it feels like I'm in a decision paralysis and also partly because (buying insurance) requires a lot of thought and research before committing to a plan,” she said. \n“Very honestly, (insurance has) never been a big priority or something that occupies any brain space. And I think a big part of it is the lack of education and complacency.”  \nAnother possible issue that arises if parents have bought insurance for their offspring is the need to update these policies as their children grow older, which some may forget to do. \nFinancial adviser Jack Foo, 35, said that parents might forget to check if better insurance plans are on offer today compared with the ones they bought for their children years ago. \n“Parents, or the children themselves if they are financially capable, should also remember to increase the coverage requirements as inflation increases the general cost of living, including healthcare.” \nSo what more can insurers do to help close the gap?\nMr Ong of Etiqa said that insurers should refocus on engaging and educating younger consumers more effectively. They can also provide affordable coverage tailored to the younger demographic’s needs and circumstances. \n“For example, while considerations of mortality might feel distant for many in this age group, the possibility of facing critical illnesses or accidents is likely to resonate with them. \n“Insurers can prioritise initiatives that aim at simplifying the insurance process for Gen Zers and enhancing their financial education with regard to insurance as a financial safety net.” \nSimilarly, financial service consultant Edgar Tan, 36, said that specifically for Gen Z, it is about educating, creating awareness, and creating a sense of urgency for them to recognise the importance of insurance.\n“Personally, I don’t find them more difficult compared to Gen X and Gen Y. We just need to find the right stories and lingo to engage them.” \nOn the other hand, Ms Chong of Legacy FA said that insurers could do more by making more creative and simple-to-understand short videos depicting the need for insurance coverage available. These may be shown in schools.\n“This could start as early as primary level. The depth of the knowledge to be shared can slowly progress along with the education years,” she suggested, adding that this will give financial practitioners like her a headstart when engaging Gen Z or future generations on insurance planning.\nFrom the young adults’ point of view, Ms Hannah Jamal, 27, said that it would be good if topics such as insurance coverage were introduced in schools, for example, during Character and Citizenship Education lessons. \n“Also, generally, I do feel like many people avoid insurance agents. So maybe more education can be done through different methods instead of the traditional face-to-face interaction at roadshows or meet-ups because I think this scares the young ones.” \nMs Hannah, who is unemployed, said that she plans to review her plans soon with her financial adviser since she had bought basic health plans five years ago, where the coverage is for early stages of critical illness with a coverage limit of S$20,000.  \nMs Wong, the account manager, said that she is likely to benefit from a national roadmap guide outlining the recommended plans for each age group or life stage.\n\"But I think it will take a lot of time to look into these things and there is inertia.\"\nAs for what she plans to do in the meantime, Ms Wong admitted that her siblings and friends have also asked her about getting insurance. \"If something bad does happen, I'll probably regret not taking this more seriously at this stage.\n\"At the same time, life is life. I understand it's the consequence of my actions. But I don't plan on dying anytime soon.\" "

            "Article Summary": "A car racing movie is supposed to be fast paced, but for a local one entitled Oversteer, its production was anything but fast.\nLocal filmmaker Derrick Lui took 10 years to take the movie from draft to screening, due to funding issues, Covid-19 lockdown and the Myanmar military coup .\nLui shared how his career in filmmaking happened by chance after his professional football aspirations got cut short.\nThe 48-year-old spoke about why despite the emergence of a young generation of filmmakers, Singapore has yet to produce the \"next Jack Neo\"",
            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — If you were to scroll through the Golden Village website, chances are you would find a seemingly obscure title called Oversteer among a long list of global blockbusters.\nAnd if one were to head down to the cinema screening it — currently only at VivoCity — promotional posters for it are conspicuously absent.\n“We don’t have any marketing budget, so you can’t even see our poster outside,” the film's director Derrick Lui, 48, told TODAY candidly in a sit-down interview recently.\n“We’ve got no money, so basically we rely on people who have watched the film sharing about it by word of mouth.”\nWithout giving away too much, here is the 86-minute feature film in a nutshell: It tells the tale of a young man whose ambitions and interest in the automotive industry led to a falling out with his family.\nThough it is touted as Singapore’s first car racing-themed movie, Lui winces at attempts to compare it with more familiar titles of the same genre, like Hollywood’s Fast and Furious franchise.\nNot least because his movie was produced on a starkly shoestring “six-figure” budget instead of a multi-million dollar one, but also because family is the central theme to his movie, he said.\nFor over an hour, Lui sat with TODAY at the Golden Village Gold Class lounge to talk about how he got into the filmmaking industry, and why Oversteer took 10 years to see the light of day.\nHe also spoke about why he thinks it is challenging to produce a commercially successful film here in Singapore.\nLui’s career in filmmaking was largely by chance; his first career choice was football.\n“I’ve decided since secondary school I wanted to be a footballer. And I worked very hard (for it) at the expense of everything else — studies, relationship,” he said.\nHis aspirations were, however, short-lived when he broke his ankle during a match.\nWanting to make full use of his time while serving National Service after the injury, the business diploma graduate decided then to further his studies. \nBeing a self-professed “mischievous” youth who “hates memorising”, he looked out for the course with as much practical component to the syllabus as possible, which led him to a filmmaking degree.\nEven then, he experienced some speed bumps along the way. He could still remember how he was the only one in class to fail their first assignment in video editing.\n“It got me thinking: ‘Is this all a big mistake?’” he recalled.\nFortunately, he had a wonderful lecturer “whom I attribute to changing a bit of my life”. She took him aside, told him that she saw talent in him and patiently went through with him the mistakes that he made.\nLui said that after the chat, he excelled for the rest of his assignments.\nFor about 20 years or so since then, Lui delved into a full-time career in production — with stints in Mediacorp’s television commercial division Caldecott Productions International and MTV Asia, among others.\nHe recalled at times travelling for months to film programmes, such as a food travelogue with Malaysian celebrity Chef Wan.\nBut the father of three eventually shifted gears, opting to do short-form productions so he could better control his schedule and spend more time with his children.\n“I felt that if you lose them when they’re young, you will not recover what you’ve lost when you’re older. So you’ll lose them forever.”\nHis first feature film, 1400, was completed in 2015 and went on to receive awards at film festivals in Sydney, Australia and Los Angeles, United States.\nOversteer is his second feature film but his first commercial theatrical release.\nIt almost never saw the light of day.\nLui lost a producer, who was poached for another project, as well as funding from a government agency.\nAt one point in 2017, the film reportedly had a budget of S$2.5 million, with Singapore singer and actor Nathan Hartono among the cast, though even this did not materialise.\nEventually, the budget dwindled down to “six figures”, funded by Lui’s life savings and him selling his extensively “zhenged” car — colloquial for upgraded.\nEquivalent to a four-room public flat? Three-room? Lui merely let out a little chuckle at this reporter’s attempt to narrow down the figure he poured into the film.\n“It’s hard to do itemised costing when you’re a one-man show,” he said, dismissing the question.\nEven some of local filmmaker Jack Neo’s “drama-driven, no action scene” works cost upwards of a million dollars, Lui pointed out.\nHe wrote the first draft for the movie idea 10 years ago, and eventually managed to complete the actual shooting in 14 days in early 2020 — “very fast”, by his own admission.\nBut border lockdowns due to Covid-19 prevented him from flying to Bangkok to oversee the final touches of the post-production editing process.\nHe then outsourced the audio post-production works to a team in Myanmar, but then the 2021 military coup happened and threw another spanner in the works.\nAfter overcoming all the obstacles, Oversteer premiered in Golden Village cinemas in January this year and has since elicited some mixed responses.\nA review by 8days described it as “unbelievably boring” and deserving to be renamed as Overhaul.\nOn Letterboxd — a social network where moviegoers share their own reviews — one reviewer described Oversteer as “woefully underwritten”, adding that Lui’s passion for the local car scene “is clear, but… (translated) in a generic fashion on screen”.\nOn the other hand, a review on Singapore Film Society site had this to say about the film: “Its tight storyline, reasonably strong performance, relatable characters, and some authentic racing moments will not leave you disappointed.”\nAsked to comment, Lui said this is part and parcel of producing a commercial film, where even global blockbusters that have spawned their own cult following cannot please everybody. \nCloser to home, he again cited Neo as an example: “Many critics can slam his movies, I realised, but his box office numbers (are) still very good.”\nAnd he doesn’t see “the next Jack Neo” despite the emergence of a younger generation of filmmakers making waves in the film festival circuit.\nLui said there are many factors going against an aspiring director who wants to produce a commercially successful film here — partly why he pressed on with this commercial film project until the finish line despite the obstacles he faced.\nTo produce an indie film catering to a relatively smaller, niche audience at film festivals is already challenging, but to come up with one targeting the mass audience is a whole different set of challenges altogether, he said.\nAnd in Singapore, an aspiring filmmaker has to grapple with a local market that is inherently small, consisting of an audience who are spoiled for choice when it comes to entertainment — from the big screens to streaming services.\nHaving a smaller target audience naturally means there is a cap to how much one could realistically make from ticket sales. Lui said that one can expect to make about S$2 or so per ticket sold here — which in turn sets the limit to how much a filmmaker can realistically spend on making a movie.\n“If you don’t spend a lot of money, you cannot get the biggest actors, you cannot get the best crew,” he said.\nLui himself harbours little to no hope of making money from the movie, although he stressed that he would do it all over again with no regrets.\nAsked for his parting words to Singaporeans, Lui said that making a film is already a tough endeavour, even more so in Singapore.\n“So please support Singapore films. If our own Singaporeans don’t support Singapore films, who else will?”"

            "Article Body": "Please be advised that the articles delve into topics and accounts of trauma and abuse that may be triggering to the reader.\nSINGAPORE — Growing up, home was not a safe place for Singaporeans Sharon Khoo and Nanny Eliana. The women separately recalled a time when they lived in a state of tension, anxiety, stress and uncertainty, where personal security was almost non-existent in the midst of domestic upheavals.\nWhat does a child do when the very adults meant to protect and nurture them become the source of their nightmares?\nFor Ms Eliana, 45, and Mrs Khoo, 39, they carried the weight of their difficult growing-up years into adulthood.\nBoth women later sought professional help to equip them with the skills to rebuild their mental health that had suffered due to domestic violence.\nIn conversations with TODAY, they bravely told of their adverse childhood experiences and how those early years shaped the course of their adult lives.\nThe term “adverse childhood experience” refers to a potentially traumatic situation or event that a person may face or witness while growing up.\nThe first seven years of Mrs Sharon Khoo’s childhood was filled with good memories.\nShe reminisced about the road trips to Malaysia with her parents, the joy of learning to ride a bicycle and playing hopscotch with her father.\n“Back then, my father was like my best friend. He was always the fun guy,” she said.\nEverything changed when she turned eight.\nHer father could not control his emotions and the fits of anger soon took over: He hit her when she could not answer mathematics problems or did not know how to do her homework.\nLooking back on his drastic behavioural change, Mrs Khoo said that it was probably due to financial strain and having to cope with the pressures of everyday living.\nAs time passed, domestic violence set in and became frequent.\nHe would beat his wife and eventually turned on their domestic worker as well.\nRecalling the nights filled with shouting, screaming and sounds of things being thrown around the house, Mrs Khoo said that it always felt like she was living on the edge of a “terrible disaster”.\n“It felt like I was living with a terrorist, like he wasn’t my dad anymore. I couldn’t understand why that was happening.\n“I was always fearful, always on edge and tense, not knowing when the next explosion from my dad was going to happen.”\nApart from her own fears, she was worried for her younger sister who was just a two-year-old when her father started becoming abusive.\nShe found no answers when she turned to her mother, who was also suffering but was seen from her young eyes as unwilling to stand up to her husband or leave him.\n“I cried with my mum and asked her what to do. But she told me, ‘Don’t you ever tell anyone about what's happening in our family’. I think there was a lot of shame,” Mrs Khoo added.\nNot being able to tell anyone about her family situation made her feel helpless and “trapped”. She remembered crying a lot.\n“No one taught me how to really take care of myself or respond to the situation. I recall being very depressed… and would just cry repeatedly.\n“I was so scared to go home after school that I would cry out to God.\n“Home was like a hell hole; I was scared that I was going to die in there.”\nAt 14, after experiencing another episode of her father’s verbal and physical abuse, something snapped.\nShe plucked up the courage and headed towards the police station, even though her mother had warned her not to get her father into trouble. The mother was worried that he would go to jail and they would be in financial difficulty.\n“This was despite both my parents working and earning incomes. When I heard that, I told my mum that she couldn’t keep doing that and enabling the abuse,” Mrs Khoo recounted.\nAfter telling the police officer what had happened, a personal protection order was filed against her father.  \n“I was very relieved and grateful to the officer who was very kind. He told me to keep (the report) and if my dad ever hit me again, to return and report it.\n“That gave me the assurance that okay, someone’s still taking care of me. When I stepped out of the police station, my dad was actually standing outside.\n“He was very sombre, quiet and didn’t dare talk to me or make eye contact.\n“I felt really terrible because that was not what I wanted to do to my dad. I love my parents.”\nThat moment of courage brought her some relief, because he never used physical violence on her again.\nBy then, though, the traumatic experiences had left a profound impact on the teenager, who developed suicidal thoughts and self-harm tendencies. \nFeeling helpless, “stuck and alone”, she wanted the pain to stop.\nShe was still living in a toxic environment because even though the physical abuse stopped, the verbal and emotional abuse continued.\nAt 22, she got married to Mr Joshua Khoo and they had their first child a few years later when she was 25.\nUp to the time she got pregnant, she was still wrestling with dark thoughts and persistent low moods.\n“When I found out that I was pregnant, I cried and told myself that no matter what, I’m determined not to let my daughter suffer the way that I did. It is her existence in my life that led me to go see a psychiatrist.”\nAfter her consultations, she was diagnosed with clinical depression and complex traumatic stress disorder.\nPeople who have this form of traumatic stress disorder usually have experienced long-term trauma.\nIt develops over months or years rather than over a single event, where there were repeated occasions where the victims had little control and were unable to escape their situation. \nSupported by a Christian counsellor, a psychiatrist and a psychologist who kickstarted her healing process, Mrs Khoo underwent a combination of therapy and medications.\nShe was also supported by her husband, church mates and her faith, which eventually lifted the fog.\nDuring this period, when her daughter turned one year old in 2010, the family of three moved to Thailand, drawn by a shared desire to do missionary work.\nHer firstborn is now 14 years old and her younger daughter is aged 10.\nThe Khoo family continues to call Thailand home, returning to Singapore once a year for social visits. \nAs part of her healing journey, Mrs Khoo wrote a book about the childhood experiences that her mother had told her to keep to herself.\nTitled Hope in Despair, it chronicles her journey in overcoming clinical depression, complex traumatic stress disorder and the deep emotional wounds she sustained from domestic abuse.\nDespite her initial hesitation of “putting myself out there”, hearing news of people dying by suicide spurred her to tell her story. She hopes that it would help others going through similar adversities.\nMrs Khoo said that she has forgiven both her parents, but still has some ways to go in reconciling with her father.\n“I love my parents and have no animosity with them. There were so many times I felt so bad for them, and so saddened and ashamed of what had happened to our family.”\nWhen asked what was her parents’ reaction to her book, Mrs Khoo said that they did not object to it. Her mother had told her that she felt ashamed and guilty for what had happened.\nHer father had also apologised to her after the birth of her firstborn, but reconciliation has not been easy. She requested that he sought professional help, but he declined.\nThere were occasions when he was verbally abusive in front of her daughter, such that Mrs Khoo and her husband had to draw boundaries and not meet him in person to maintain their family’s safety.\nFor example, they would not meet both her parents together because that tended to trigger fighting and disagreements.\n“I learned that forgiving him is one thing but reconciling is another,” she added.\n“Just because you forgive, it doesn't mean you will have an okay relationship with the person who hurt you.\n“If the person doesn’t know how to change or won’t actively seek professional help to change, he or she will just fall back on old habits and patterns.”\nHer psychiatrist had commented that her father seemed to display symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder and borderline personality disorder.\nNarcissistic personality disorder leads to egoistical behaviour and lack of empathy, while borderline personality disorder affects one’s ability to manage emotions.\nBoth personality disorders may involve dramatic, overly emotional or unpredictable thinking or behaviours, and interfere with how they relate to other people.\n“But it was also definitely his unwillingness to be responsible for his own stress and frustration, and just letting it run free and wild in the house,” Mrs Khoo added.\nMr and Mrs Khoo serve in The Acts Church of Chiang Mai in Thailand and have also ministered in other countries including Australia, Brunei and Cambodia.\nAs a certified pastoral counsellor now, Mrs Khoo supports others being battered by their own storms.\nLearning to overcome childhood trauma has shaped her perspective on her family life, and she is immensely grateful to experience what it is like to have a loving family.\nSpeaking of her husband and children, she said: “They are my greatest gift and achievement. With them, my family life is so different from the one I previously knew with my family of origin.\n“My husband and children had to bear with me during the early years and watch me come out of the pain. But once I managed to do that, we could finally have a functional, healthy and normal family life.”\nTo others struggling with adversity and trauma, she wants to tell them that they are “worthy of care, love and all the right things in life”.\n“No matter how out of control your situation may be or how you feel now, you have the free will and power to choose how you want to respond to adversity.\n“No one, no abuser, bully or toxic situation can ever take away that power from you,” she asserted.\nAs a childhood abuse survivor, Mrs Khoo understands the importance of self-love in healing wounds of the past. Rewriting a life story begins from within.\n“The most powerful, positive change is when you choose to love yourself, then you’ll do the right things for yourself and turn your life around.”\nPoised and articulate, Ms Nanny Eliana helms a medical and healthcare communications agency, which has offices in Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand.\nThe Singaporean businesswoman also holds the position of chairperson of the Katong-Joo Chiat Business Association, which is a volunteer-led organisation that champions and supports the interests and welfare of business owners in the Katong and Joo Chiat area.\nDeep beneath her confident exterior, though, is a girl who never felt like she belonged anywhere.\nBorn in 1979 as the youngest of three daughters, she was given up for adoption at two weeks old to a Singaporean couple when her family had financial difficulties.\nThe early years of her childhood with her adoptive parents were relatively comfortable. Though strict, they provided material comforts and a stable family life.\nWhen Ms Eliana was nine years old, her adoptive mother who was a homemaker died from cancer.\nHer adoptive father, a civil servant, remarried about two years later.\nAfter her adoptive mother died, he became stricter. Spending her pre-adolescent and teenage years under her adoptive father’s harsh disciplinarian ways was rough. His explosive temper and rigid curfews created a tense atmosphere at home.\n“As a teenager at the time, it was impossible to have a conversation with him,” she recalled.\n“He was not able to regulate his emotions and would fly off the handle easily, throw things around the house, ground me.\n“He locked me out of the house several times.”\nMs Eliana had some suspicion that she was adopted because she did not look like her adoptive family members.\nShe never confirmed it until her adoptive father revealed the truth during a heated argument and told her to return to her biological family.\nShe was 18 then.\n“Thrown back” to her biological family, the teenager had no choice but to start living with two older sisters, mother and father. Her father was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.\nMs Eliana recalled that she could not really adapt to her new life, having lived in the comfort of her adoptive family’s five-room flat in a public housing block where she had her own bedroom.\nThe shift to the cramped quarters of her biological family’s three-room flat meant that she had to share a bedroom with her adult older sisters.\nThe lack of material comforts did not bother her as much as the lack of emotional connection and sense of safety.\nHer mentally ill biological father thought that she was returned to the family to murder him.\nSchizophrenia is a major psychotic illness where the sufferer is unable to tell what is real or unreal sometimes. The most common form is paranoid schizophrenia, where the patient has an altered perception of reality.\nPatients have to take medication for symptoms of hallucinations that may include hearing voices, or of paranoia where they believe they are being followed or controlled, among other delusions.\nMs Eliana’s father did not consistently take his medication, which would then lead to episodes of abnormal behaviour and violence. \nRecounting the times when her father punched her, she said: “I was caught unaware because he may be sitting quietly and suddenly, he would lunge at me.\n“Back then, he used to wear rings with big stones on them. And he would punch me till the stones dropped off the ring, and the metal part of the ring cut into the skin under my eye.”\nThere were also times when he would charge at her with a knife. When that happens, she would lock herself in the bedroom.\n“My sisters will berate him, telling him that it’s wrong to do that. But the thing is, he had no control over it.”\nShe added: “All I was thinking at the time was I needed to get out of there.”\nDespite their blood ties, Ms Eliana did not feel a close bond with her older siblings. There were also moments when she felt that she was not welcomed or wanted.\n“My sisters grew up together in hardship, so they were very close-knit. When I came into the picture, maybe they saw me as the ‘brat’, the third child who grew up in comfort, given the opportunity to go to university while they had to work to support the family.”\nThe painful and isolating experiences at home notwithstanding, Ms Eliana graduated from university, with her school fees funded by her adoptive father through the national social security savings scheme that is the Central Provident Fund.\nEager to build her career, she started work as a writer, only to realise that her working environment at the time caused her unnecessary stress.\nAbout a year after graduating from university, Ms Eliana began freelancing.\nShe spent her waking hours outside home, writing at fast-food restaurants, meeting interviewees in their offices for fear that her mentally ill father would attack her.\nTragedy struck again when her biological mother died in 2005 from a sudden illness.\n“She was literally the glue that held me to the family. So with her gone, the next thing I did was to move out,” Ms Eliana said.\nThe following year, she got married. Around the same time, she was offered a small space in a shophouse in the Boat Quay area for S$200 a month that she turned into her office.\nShe decided to build her own communications agency Bridges M&C, armed with a laptop bought with half a year’s worth of savings, a wall phone and dial-up internet.\nHer marriage did not work out and they divorced after she met someone else, her current husband.\nMs Eliana admitted that a sense of safety and stability often eluded her.\n“I always felt like no one could support me and I had to be prepared to move or for things to change.” \nHer marriage to her second husband, who worked in corporate training at the time, had a tumultuous start.\nDuring the global financial recession in 2008, he lost all of his clients. Ms Eliana was still building her business then.\nShe often found herself “feeling paralysed”. At the lowest point in her life, in 2011, she decided to get professional help.\n“By then, my life felt like a reset button, starting over again repeatedly. It felt like the choices I made often led me to dead ends.” \nSeeing a trauma therapist was the right move and Ms Eliana has kept up her appointments for the past 13 years.\nWhen asked if there was a turning point in her life, she did not remember any particular huge breakthroughs in her healing journey, saying that she is “still a work-in-progress”.\n“The ‘breaking free’ was incremental. It’s the little things like waking up and not feeling paralysed, and even when things happen, you are not overwhelmed by frustration or anger, such that you don’t make decisions in a way that doesn’t benefit you,” she added.\n“I was able to undo the belief that I couldn’t rely on anyone’s support. No matter how independent you are, how self-sufficient you are, we all need other people.” \nShe did not get the support she needed from her adoptive or biological families, but Ms Eliana built her own network of support through her husband, friends and her long-time therapist.\nEven within her own business, she set the tone for a supportive environment so that her staff members have psychological safety.\n“People can say what they feel without being shot down and are not made to feel like they are disregarded.”\nThe media and communications industry has its shares of high turnovers, but most of her employees have stuck around. One of them is celebrating his 10-year work anniversary this month.\nMs Eliana has continued to keep in touch with her adoptive family, but lost touch with her biological family after they moved out of their old flat. “They have not reached out to me,” she said.\nMs Eliana is hoping that her experience will help people with mental health troubles feel less alone in their struggles.\nShe has also contributed to a literary anthology (a collection of literary works) called Letter to My Mother, where she wrote about how living with a father who has paranoid schizophrenia affected her family.\n“Being human is complex but there are ways for you to process your emotions if you get help.\n“I think people don’t realise that others might have also gone through the same experiences until they hear someone else talking about it.”\nHaving benefited from therapy, she wants to encourage people to seek professional help.\nTo her, it is important to continue “feeling”, even the difficult emotions, and learn the skills to process them in a healthy manner.\n“I’m able to experience more of the good stuff, like joy. I mean, how are you going to feel joy when you are wrapped up in anxiety, hurt and despair because that’s what you’re used to?” she asked.\nThe constant and unhealthy hark-back to past wounds can become a stumbling block to healing.\n“Say, if my team decides to throw a birthday celebration for me, but in my head, all I'm thinking about is how I was hurt 10, 20 years ago, then I won’t be able to experience the support from the people around me.”\nMs Eliana said that people like her who have gone through traumatic experiences often store in their minds what has happened long after the incidents.\n“There are people who may be 70 years old but their brains are still subconsciously stuck in pockets of trauma. I think therapy has helped me to process mine.\n“My experiences taught me that the only way out is to process the trauma. You have to work through it,” she advised.\n- To find the book Hope in Despair, go online here.\n- Letter to My Mother is sold at leading bookstores.\n- RoundBox@Children's Society (Toa Payoh): 6259 3735 (Mon to Fri, 9am to 6pm)\n- Vox@Children's Society (Chai Chee): 6443 4139 (Mon to Fri, 9am to 6pm)\n- JYC@Children's Society (Jurong): 6566 6989 (Mon, Wed and Fri, 8.45am to 5.45pm)\n- The Fort@Children's Society (Radin Mas): 6276 5077 (Mon to Fri, 8.30am to 5.30pm)"

            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — Singapore's \"turtle woman\" Connie Tan is facing major challenges with plans to move her 700 or so turtles to a new purpose-built home after the contractor for the new site went bankrupt.\nThe time-frame for the project, at Khatib in Singapore's north, has blown out from an original estimate of 1.5 years to five years, with costs ballooning to more than S$1.8 million.\nThe estimated costs shown in her fundraising site include single- and double-storey housing for the turtles, filtration and utilities systems, as well as quarantine and food preparation areas.\nMs Tan, 53, also faces financial difficulties at the Live Turtle Museum Singapore that she runs at Yishun, the current home of the turtles, owing to a lack of visitors.\nNearby construction works have limited the amount of parking available at her museum, and have also led some people to believe that the museum was closed.\nCaught in a tight spot, Ms Tan took to social media platform TikTok recently to appeal for more support so that the turtles could stay on and move to their new home when it is ready.\n\"I need help today because construction is all around me and there is nobody coming to visit us as everybody thought we are closed,\" she said. \n\"So I needed social media to help me to inform people that I'm still open.\" \nAlready, the response has been heartwarming, with more than S$54,000 donated to the museum.\n\"I'm so touched and you know what? I am not alone because I have everyone's help,\" she added with tears in her eyes.\nSpeaking with TODAY, she said that before her call for help on social media, almost every cent of her retirement fund had gone towards the construction of the new location but it still was not enough.\nDespite the financial difficulties, Ms Tan said that she remains committed to her creatures and had not considered giving up on the museum or rehoming her turtles.\n\"What is not difficult? Yes, we have a lot of difficulties but if we don't get through them, we will lose this little gem that Singaporeans can call their own.\"\nMs Tan's love of turtles dates back to her early childhood.\nShe recalled asking her parents for a dog but was not allowed to have one, so she resorted to \"hiding\" turtles and fish in containers under her bed when she was six years old.\nShe was eventually found out by her father who helped care for her turtles and Ms Tan's love for the hard-shelled creatures only evolved.\nWhat started as a small collection grew into the museum where they now call home. It was first set up at Chinese Garden in Boon Lay, but later moved to its current location at 81 Lorong Chencharu off Yishun Avenue 2.\nThe idea for the museum came about after her father suggested that they showcase her turtles for others' enjoyment.\n\"It's especially fulfilling when I see children with special needs spending three to four hours here with their family and often refusing to leave,\" she said.\n\"Their family members would talk to me and thank me for opening the museum because they would see a positive change in their child.\"\nIn addition to her own collection of turtles, Ms Tan had accepted turtles from pet owners but she is now reluctant to do so given their motives.\n\"There was this woman who came to us three times, twice when we were at Chinese Garden and once when we moved here, with the same reason that she didn't know her turtles would grow so big.\n\"She said that they were cute when they were small but not when they are big, so she wanted to donate them to me, but it is not a donation to give away your pets. Do you give away your child?\"\nMs Tan is aware that some people online question the hygiene of the museum and make other criticism, but she takes it in her stride because she believes that the museum has a lot to offer visitors.\nShe added that she was not inclined to respond to people who said that the museum is \"smelly and boring, because she questions their motives.\nShe also said: \"If you tell me that an animal facility is not smelly, then I don't know where you have been.\"\nAs for those who commented on the alleged poor condition of her turtles, she said: \"They are not in any position to gauge my turtles' health and they do not see what goes on behind the scenes when the turtles are taken out for some sunlight.\"\nStill, Ms Tan acknowledged that the current facility is in need of some repairs, but she is \"reluctant\" to spend money to fix the place because she would rather spend it on the new facility.\n\"Current operational costs are already eating into the funds for the new place and it is dangerous especially when the money is already less than half of what we need.\"\nSince her video went viral, Ms Tan has received more than S$54,000 in donations and she is grateful for the help she has received so far.\nAs she works towards her goal of S$1.8 million, Ms Tan is aware that she may fall short and be forced to close the museum.\nShe desperately hopes this will not be the case and said: \"We are a Singapore brand and if we close down, it will be heartbreaking and a loss to everybody.\""

            "Article Body": "Increasingly, people are becoming aware of the importance of mental health and well-being in our lives. In our weekly Gen Zen series, TODAY looks at ways that we can feel better while coping with the mental stresses of modern life.\nSINGAPORE — When freelance editor and writer Sally (not her real name) moved out of her family home in 2019, she felt a “huge burden” had been lifted.\n“I'm able to live as myself, the person I wish to be,” the 38-year-old said, after removing herself from a “toxic home environment” that had a history of sexual, emotional and verbal abuse from her parents.\n“Living away from home has been my best decision, allowing myself to carve spaces and relationships that mean something to me, as opposed to those imposed on me.”\nFor another woman, 28-year-old Amanda Ng, she finds living with her parents and sister a “suffocating” experience, even though she has a great relationship with them.\nThe content marketing manager said that living with three adults “with different wants, needs and dietary requirements” can sometimes feel exhausting. \nThe constant need to compromise and accommodate them leaves Ms Ng feeling out of control and infantilised. \n“I feel very suffocated to constantly be around three people asking me, 'Where are you going? What are you eating?',” she said, even though she appreciates her family looking out for her.\nExperiencing friction when living with family is common, but when should one decide that enough is enough and consider moving out?\nExperts told TODAY that moving out of the family home can be exciting and a rite of passage, but it can also be complicated, saddled with warring feelings of guilt and the need to assert one’s independence. \nMs Ooi Sze Jin, founder and psychologist of A Kind Place, a counselling practice, said: “Preparing for the emotional transition of moving out of the family home can be intricate, particularly within cultural contexts valuing familial unity.\n“Deciding to take the first step towards moving out requires considerable courage and self-reflection.” \nSquabbles over which movie to watch or who is hogging the bathroom are normal when living together, but the experts said that the tipping point is when these disagreements start to affect one’s mental health.\n“Friction within the family often arises from prolonged proximity, as individuals can experience discord when spending excessive time together,” Ms Ooi said.\nShe added that other factors such as heightened awareness in adulthood, leading individuals to recognise past neglect or trauma inflicted by their parents during their formative years, also contribute to disagreements. \nMs Jeanice Cheong, a clinical psychologist from Heartscape Psychology, a psychotherapy outfit, said that occasional conflicts or disagreements are “part and parcel of living with one’s family”. \nHowever, one should pay attention when these interactions become more characterised by “aggression, criticisms, disengagement and violence”. \n“It can take a toll not just on their relationships but also their mental health,” she said.\nSome of these signs to look out for are: \nVenturing out from the familiarity of one’s home might seem like a simple transition that is much needed for some people, but the experts said that this can be highly complex for the individual. \nMs Priscilla Shin, principal psychotherapist of Range Counselling Services, said that moving out can even be “emotionally painful” because of all the memories the house holds and uncertainty about the future. \nMs Cheong from Heartscape Psychology said that living independently may also require immense adjustment and effort in managing daily demands and responsibilities, which can inevitably translate to stress. \nWhen Sally moved out, for example, she had to learn to manage finances and domestic chores.  \n“I've learnt how to stretch a dollar so that bills are paid and there's always something to cook at home,” she said. “I wouldn't say that's a surprise, but it sure is a great lesson”. \nAt the same time, moving can have a positive impact on one's mental health by helping a person achieve autonomy and independence, boosting their self-esteem and empowering them to make decisions aligned with their values, Ms Shin said.\nShe added that living independently also allows a person to create an environment that promotes relaxation and personal expression, reducing stress and improving overall mental well-being.\nSally can attest to this, saying that living away from home brings “so much more benefits”. \n“Sure, I have to take on domestic responsibilities now, but it's on my own terms and I've created my own safe space,” she said. \nFurthermore, this “newfound freedom” and distance often reshape the dynamics of familial interactions, Ms Shin from Range Counselling Services said. \nThis is because being distant from the family can lead to healthier boundaries and improved relationships, reducing conflicts and tensions.\nAgreeing, Ms Ng said: “I think moving out might even strengthen our relationship because I would want to see them (my family members) a bit more.\n“When I'm away from them, I tend to want to check in on them a little bit more.” \nFor those who strongly desire to move out but cannot do so yet, establishing boundaries with household members and practising self-care can alleviate some of the stresses of living with the family.\nIdentifying these boundaries can be as simple as needing time alone to recharge after work or school and wanting family members to knock on the door before entering your room. \nMs Cheong said that it is important to be clear about your boundaries and what you want your family to do about it. \nFor example, you may communicate this to your family by saying: “I feel uncomfortable when you enter my room without knocking. Please knock before entering the next time.”\nMs Cheong added: “When boundaries are respected, it can lead to a more conducive family environment and better family relationships.”\nThe experts agreed that having an open dialogue with family members is the most ideal situation. However, if that is not possible, professional help can be considered. \n“When communication proves challenging, seeking external support such as family counselling can provide invaluable insight into familial dynamics and enhance communication strategies,” Ms Ooi said.\nIn addition to establishing boundaries, practising self-care such as mindfulness can help individuals better understand their emotional responses to familial stressors.\nOther self-care tips include:\nMs Shin said: “Most importantly, the person should set realistic expectations for themselves and the situation, acknowledging that change takes time.”"

            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — Almost exactly 12 years ago on April 20, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong began his foray into the world of social media — starting his personal Facebook and Twitter (now known as X) accounts. \nSince then, Mr Lee has garnered over 1.7 million followers on Facebook, 890,000 on X and 729,000 on Instagram — numbers that make him Singapore’s most popular politician by way of online reach.\nBy comparison, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, who will succeed Mr Lee as the country’s head of Government come May 15, has around 440,000 followers on all three platforms combined.\nMedia practitioners TODAY spoke to said that a large part of Mr Lee's success on social media can be attributed to the “authenticity” in his posts.\nHis habit of uploading photos he takes himself as opposed to professionally shot images curated for the public, for example, endears him to the masses, said Ms Charu Srivastava, the co-founder of strategic communications consultancy TriOn & Co.\nThe consistency in which he often signs off his posts — with an abbreviated \"LHL\" — also signals to his audience that it is him pushing the \"send\" button from his phone.\nMs Chloe Lim, an account director at integrated creative agency DSTNCT, said this is a deviation from the public’s expectation that political figures typically have a team posting on behalf of them, and that it creates an extra layer of connection.\nAs his 20-year tenure as prime minister comes to an end, TODAY takes a look back at 20 of Mr Lee’s most viral and memorable social media posts.\n1. Kicking things off is PM Lee’s most popular photograph on his Facebook page. It has more than 169,000 likes and 7,300 comments.\nPosted a day after National Day in 2020, the lack of a discernible smile behind Mr Lee’s face mask was perhaps an apt depiction of the country’s overall mood — still very much reeling post-circuit breaker. \nHis caption contained just three words: “Photo by me”.\n2. Here is Mr Lee donning a safety helmet alongside Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on Jan 11 this year. \nThey were in Johor commemorating the completion of the RTS Link connecting span – and what’s a commemoration without a selfie? \nThe photo garnered over 1.4 million views on X.\n3. On National Day 2016, Mr Lee uploaded this 360° “wefie” of him together with a donut of guards.\nThe photo, taken the day before the Istana Ceremonial Guard at the National Day Observance Ceremony, generated much discussion in the comments on Instagram.\n4. Mr Lee also occasionally posts updates that give us a glimpse into the interesting bits of a prime minister’s day-to-day life — like the time a barn owl flew into his office to greet him in 2013.\nPerhaps it wanted a selfie. \nEither way, Mr Lee used the opportunity to state in his post, which garnered 28,000 likes on Facebook, his support for preserving flora and fauna in urban Singapore. \n5. He also updates his followers with unforgettable life milestones — like the time he received his PAssion Silver Concession Card.\n6. Even though Mr Lee acknowledged that receiving that silver PAssion card made him a “certified senior citizen”, he can still be young at heart. \nThis photo he took with a group of Nanyang Technological University students in 2015 is an example of a “jump shot” – which was very much in trend with younger folk a decade ago.\n7. He attempted yet another jump shot in 2017 alongside his fellow Ang Mo Kio Town Council Members of Parliament at his yearly Chinese New Year open house.\nMr Lee chose to put his hands up in the air this time, perhaps thinking what he wrote in the Instagram caption: “Huat ah!”\n8. This photo together with his wife Ho Ching was uploaded a day after Valentine’s Day in 2016 and proved popular with netizens.\n9. Mr Lee is clearly a fan of the occasional #throwback. \nHere he is seen as a toddler next to his father and Singapore’s founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew. \nThis picture was posted on Fathers’ Day 2015 and was accompanied by a touching message: \nHe wrote: “Fathers are an important part of our lives. They are our guide, role model and inspiration. \n“My father had a powerful influence on me, as he did on others. Now, as a father, I try to do the same for my children.”\n10. And here he is with one of them in his arms. \n“Carrying Hongyi. Ho Ching is pregnant with Haoyi,” read the caption. \n11. Social media influencers often do “plugs” on their posts, which refer to the promotion of an item, object or company to their audiences.\nMr Lee, the politician whose number of followers compare decently to other international influencers, gave his own (likely unpaid) plug here.\n“Here is a photo of my classmates and me in 1963 wearing our very own Bata shoes!” he wrote in his caption.\n“If you have fond memories or photos of your Bata school shoes, do share them in the comments below!”\n12. Before the People’s Action Party’s lunchtime rally at Fullerton Square in 2020, Mr Lee took to social media to post this throwback photo from 1984.\nThat year, he prevailed over Giam Lai Cheng of the United People’s Front to become MP of Teck Ghee Single Member Constituency.\n13. Mr Lee also posted this photo on what would have been his father’s 100th birthday, on Sept 16, 2023.\n14. Jump shots and throwbacks aside, Mr Lee also posts videos on his social media pages. \nThey tend to be filmed and edited by his own media team, but they also indicate an openness to the trends of today.\nThis one on Instagram shows his 2021 Year in Review.\n15. The magic cup speaks for itself.\nIt was made famous when Mr Lee announced the Covid-19 circuit breaker in 2022 — where he seemed to change the language he spoke each time he took a sip of water from said cup. \nInstead of shying away from the joke, he embraced it. In this post, he used the magic cup for yet another “plug”. \n“If you don’t have a magic cup like mine — don’t fret! Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) has launched SG Translate Together — a portal to generate draft localised translations in our four official languages, and include uniquely Singaporean terms.” \n16. There is also this reposted video of otters crossing the road from across the Istana in 2022, shot by a user named OtterGrapher on Instagram.\nMr Lee lets us in on the fact that otters have been exploring the lawns of the Istana for some time.\nHe proceeded to thank the Istana staff, NParks, the Singapore Police Force and members of the public for helping the otters “co-exist with us safely in our urban environment”.\n“This gotong royong (communal spirit) concern for the otters is a metaphor for the society we are building.\n“Opportunities for everyone, being prepared for the unexpected, and most of all a society that cares,” he wrote.\n17. A mainstay feature of Mr Lee’s posts on social media are the photos he takes on his #jalanjalan (or walks) — showing off his photography chops in the process.\nIn December 2019, he ventured out to Gardens by the Bay to catch the annual solar eclipse and ended up capturing this beauty. \n“The skies were a little cloudy, but fortunately at the critical moment the sun (and moon) peeped through!”\nHe even shared the camera settings he used with his followers. \n18. And if you were in any doubt of his eye for composing great photos, here’s another one he captured while he was exploring the mirror maze at the Light to Night Festival in 2018.\n“Some of us were lost in the maze, while others were lost in each other,” he wrote. \n19. Not all his #jalanjalan photos are aesthetic, however. Some just tickle your funny bone. \nWhile at a restaurant in Rome in October 2021, Mr Lee snapped this picture of “Signor Skeleton” looking thrilled with a glass of red wine.\nHe didn’t give his followers much context to this post — but do we really need one here?\n20. After announcing on Monday that he would be stepping down as prime minister, Mr Lee posted this photo on his Instagram page, and in his caption urged Singaporeans to “give Lawrence (Wong) and his team your full support”. \nMr Wong told the media on Tuesday that Mr Lee would continue serving as senior minister in the upcoming new Cabinet.\nIn the comments section of this post, which received over 42,000 likes, Singaporeans seemed to appreciate the visual metaphor Mr Lee provided with the photograph.\nOne user wrote: “Your legacy will be rooted deep in many of our hearts.”\n"

            "Article Summary": "In the second of a four-part series on adverse childhood experiences — ahead of World Infant, Child and Adolescent Mental Health Day on April 23 — TODAY speaks to medical professionals and people who work with children on how they help children rise above adversity after traumatic or abusive experiences, and why hushing up, evading or denying such experiences can be damaging.\nThe first part is on how abuse, parents' divorce and living with mentally unwell persons can affect a child's lifelong health and relationships.\nThe third carries the accounts of two women who grew up in households where there was domestic violence.\nThe fourth examines how to process past hurts and practise forgiveness when you have had a difficult or traumatic childhood.\nUnexplained disruptive behaviour.\nUnexplained, intense outbursts of anger and aggression.\nBecoming withdrawn.\nLoss of interest in activities they used to enjoy.\nLoss of focus and concentration on tasks.\nPsychosomatic symptoms such as stomach upsets, fatigue and headaches.\nIntrusive thoughts.\nBeing easily frightened or scared.\nShowing sadness, fear or crying frequently.\nChanges in appetite.\nHaving sleep difficulties.\nRegressive behaviour where the child returns to an earlier stage of development such as bedwetting.\nExhibiting reckless and risky behaviours such as substance misuse and inappropriate sexual activity.\nThe first phase of treatment is to ensure that the child’s immediate environment is “safe enough”, which is defined as removing triggers that may potentially destabilise the child.\nNext, the child and caregivers are taught skills on how to manage strong emotions.\nProcessing trauma begins once safety and regulation skills are established. This is because discussing past difficult experiences tends to be highly triggering and it is important to set the child to process these memories in a safe way.\nCreative and expressive therapies such as art, play, music and drama may also help children who cannot verbalise their trauma due to pain and shock.\nFriends at the Child Guidance Clinic works with schools, the police, social service organisations, the Ministry of Social and Family Development and other agencies to support children and youth. They include young offenders, youth-at-risk, child abuse victims and families involved in complex custody and access disputes.\nThe Resilience Programme workshops help children with parents who have a psychiatric illness develop resilience and understand what mental health is. They also learn skills to manage the everyday challenges they face at home.\nThe society makes a concerted effort to use a trauma-informed approach to support children with adverse childhood experiences and their families.\nIts practitioners are trained to carry out a psychosocial programme called Be The Light, developed by psychosocial trauma support services at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH) to support children and caregivers after a traumatic event.\nIn 2019, KKH started a home visitation pilot programme called Anchor with the partnership of Temasek Foundation to support children under the age of four who are exposed to adverse childhood experiences. As of February this year, more than 160 children have been enrolled in the programme.\nThe programme is fully funded by Temasek Foundation, the charitable arm of state investor Temasek Holdings, and is also voluntary, which means that parental consent is obtained before a child is enrolled.\nChildren are referred to the Anchor programme if they are:\n- Under the age of four and seen in KKH for suspected non-accidental injuries\n- The child’s sibling who is also under the age of four and living in the same household.\nYouth centres under the Singapore Children’s Society.\nFei Yue's Online Counselling Service: eC2.sg website (Mon to Fri, 10am to 12pm, 2pm to 5pm).\nInstitute of Mental Health's Mental Health Helpline: 6389-2222 (24 hours).\nSamaritans of Singapore: 1800-221-4444 (24 hours) / 1-767 (24 hours).\nSingapore Association for Mental Health: 1800-283-7019 (Mon to Fri, 9am to 6pm).\nSilver Ribbon Singapore: 6386-1928 / 6509-0271 (Mon to Fri, 9am to 6pm).\nTinkle Friend: 1800-274-4788 (Mon to Fri, 2.30pm to 5pm).\nTouchline (Counselling): 1800-377-2252 (Mon to Fri, 9am to 6pm)",
            "Article Body": "Please be advised that the articles delve into trauma-related topics that may be triggering to the reader.\nSINGAPORE — Adverse childhood experiences are potentially traumatic events that occur in a child’s life before the age of 18.\nSome of them are harmful and obvious when there is abuse and maltreatment. Others are less apparent but equally traumatic such as enduring pain from an injury or prolonged hospitalisation, not fitting in among peers and emotional neglect from parents.\nIn children and teenagers who are still growing physically, cognitively and emotionally, these early adverse experiences can leave a negative imprint on their development, behaviour and health right into adulthood.\nIn an ideal world, every child will grow up safe, loved and supported. Yet, painful and distressing experiences are sometimes unavoidable, and not every child has the inner resources and capacity to bounce back on their own from the shock or hurt.\nSo what are the signs to watch for in children and teenagers who are traumatised? And what can be done to help them recover from an adverse childhood experience or traumatic event?\nOne thing is clear and especially crucial: The presence of a safe and nurturing environment and equivalent relationships. Just one consistent adult figure who can provide love and care is the key to help them start healing.\nHowever, an important step is to first acknowledge the occurrence of a traumatic experience, because healing cannot begin in silence or denial.\nAdjunct Associate Professor Daniel Fung, chief executive officer of the Institute of Mental Health (IMH),  said: “We need to recognise that there was a potentially traumatic event and help the child to deal with it.\n“There’s a saying that a burden shared is a burden halved.\n“I've seen a number of children where the parents are really in denial of something that has happened in the family when it's clear that there was abuse. And that’s painful for the child.”\nAlthough different children may process a traumatic event differently, some tell-tale signs to pay attention to are:\nResearch from the Singapore Children’s Society found that having one or more consistent, safe attachment adult figure in the child’s life can help the child bounce back after adversity.\nIn the absence of parents, these adults may be other family members, family friends, school counsellors, teachers, befrienders, mentors or neighbours.\nWhat if parents or immediate family cannot provide support or continue to be the source of trauma, for example, in cases of child abuse or ill-treatment?\nSenior clinical psychologist Jeremy Heng said that in such cases, professional agencies such as Family Service Centres and the Child Protective Service under the Ministry of Social and Family Development will work with other adults in the child’s life to establish safety.\nHe added: “Having someone who trusts in you, who tells you that whatever negative things that have happened is not your fault, that you are safe, are loved and wanted, that you belong, are good enough and that the future is hopeful.\n“These messages help ground a child and give them an opportunity to develop healthily and thrive in spite of their adverse childhood experiences.”\nMr Heng is the deputy head of Sunbeam Place at Singapore Children’s Society, a residential home for abused and neglected children.\nThere, for example, the residential care workers are parental figures for many of the young residents. Not only do they provide care, they also gently guide them to correct their mistakes using “teachable moments”.\nMr Heng illustrated how it often takes a village to support traumatised children: An eight-year-old was referred to Sunbeam Place after prolonged harsh physical punishment and emotional rejection by her parents.\nWhen she was first admitted, her intense emotional and behavioural outbursts often meant that she was biting, punching and scratching the staff members.\nA group people were roped in to give the necessary support: A psychologist, residential care workers, a child development team and social workers.\n“Currently, the teenager (now aged 14) is thriving in secondary school and is vice-captain for her sports co-curricular activity. She copes well with distress and relational conflicts, using her preferred emotional regulation strategies,” Mr Heng said.\n“She also encourages and takes care of younger residents (at Sunbeam Place)who struggle with managing their difficult emotions because they remind her of her younger self.\n“Most importantly, she is going home to her family in the next few months because both the professionals and her family have expressed confidence in a safe and stable reunification.”\nReferring to Singapore Children’s Society’s research, Mr Heng said that when children who perceived that they had no one or only a few people whom they can turn to for emotional support, those who were exposed to more adverse childhood experiences had more of what is known as “internalising problems”, which are the feelings that develop internally such as anxiety, social withdrawal and depression.\nWhen they perceived that they had more people to turn to, they were less likely to experience these feelings.\nMr Heng said that receiving the appropriate intervention after a traumatic event is critical. This is to ensure that the child feels safe and is not in immediate danger or harm.\nIt helps the child make sense of what has happened and reduce the likelihood of psychological troubles later.\n“No other intervention may be effective if the harm continues,” he added.\nClinical psychologist Claire Ng from IMH said that trauma-focused work with children often involves working closely with families and communities.\n“A large part of the work is helping children and families understand the impact of trauma on children,” she said.\n“This helps families develop empathy for the child who may have difficulties regulating their emotions and behaviour after experiencing trauma.\n“Another important part of the work is also helping caregivers understand how to help the child feel safe, both physically and emotionally.”\nMs Ng is with IMH’s department of developmental psychiatry and the forensic rehabilitation, intervention, evaluation and network development services (Friends).\nTrauma Systems Therapy is one form of therapy used that actively involves the caregivers and communities to support the child:\nAn approach called Trauma-informed Positive Behavioural Interventions and Supports (TI-PBIS) is used in the residential care setting at Sunbeam Place under the Singapore Children’s Society.\nIt is a system of care that equips children with adaptive behaviours that help them regulate their emotions and form positive social connections.\nTo promote social connections, each of its six dormitories is set up to resemble a typical Singaporean household, with a living room, study room and bedrooms.\nThe residents have daily routines and activities that are mundane but critical in promoting positive behaviour and social interaction, Mr Heng said.\nFor example, having meals together and sharing about their day, deciding on activities to do as a group and studying together.\nBesides letting the residents feel they are safe and loved, can trust others and have control, the recurring positive interactions allow them to “unlearn” maladaptive interaction patterns such as being aggressive to protect themselves, and to learn healthier ways to relate to others.\n“They also learn skills to tolerate distress and regulate themselves using more effective and healthier methods.\n“This is why having one or more consistent safe and trusted adult attachment figures is so critical to scaffold, guide and promote the learning of necessary skills to support the recovery of these children and youth,” Mr Heng explained.\nIn Singapore, various programmes are in place to support traumatised children. The following are just a few of them.\n1. INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH\n2. SINGAPORE CHILDREN’S SOCIETY\nMs Ang Jia Yi, a counsellor at Yishun Family Service under the Singapore Children’s Society, said: “The aim is to reduce the likelihood of individuals developing more severe distress and trauma symptoms. The majority of them return to normalcy with adequate support.”\n3. KK WOMEN’S AND CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL\nDr Yeleswarapu Padmini, senior consultant with KKH’s department of child development, said: “(Information on) the history of non-accidental injuries could come from one of the parents, community agency supporting the family or from preschool if they have identified any signs and symptoms suggestive of any non-accidental injuries.\n“At the same time, a detailed evaluation of the child and information gathered by the medical social worker as part of the social evaluation would also be considered.”\nDr Padmini added that children who are exposed to adverse childhood experiences often come from families that have competing needs. These may include financial concerns or the child’s caregiver could have mental health ailments.\nOne of the advantages of receiving help through the Anchor programme is that the interventions are carried out in the family's home. \nThe team — consisting of various professionals — comes up with individualised plans to address the specific challenges that the child and family have. \nFor example, children exposed to a significant traumatic event will get support from a psychologist who can provide more trauma-focused interventions.\nFor children with health or developmental problems, they will be supported by paediatricians and allied health professionals. \nMs Ng from IMH said that humans are innately wired to seek connection and learn about themselves, others and the world through the eyes of their early caregivers.\n“If a child can rely on safe, reliable caregivers to meet their needs, they develop a mental model of the world as a safe place.\n“This perception of a secure base allows them to explore the world with confidence, develop healthy relationships, manage setbacks effectively and so on,” she explained.\nUnderstanding the impact of adverse childhood experiences and the struggles that families face spurred Morning Star Community Services to launch a free evening “drop-in” service in 2016.\nThe child may be dropped off at the centre where it runs its CareNights programme, which supports lower-income families in need who require care for their children on weekday nights.\nThis gives parents time at night for work or to take courses to improve their skills. This also allows them to get a respite for families going through a difficult time such as those undergoing divorce or attending to critically ill family members.\nCareNights also conduct parenting workshops and organise parent-child bonding activities such as outings and birthday celebrations for children who attends CareNights and their families.\nA large proportion of families that place their children with CareNights are single-parent households. It currently supports 63 children across four centres.\nMr Lemuel Yanos Baculanta, the programme’s assistant manager, said: “Supporting parents is crucial in addressing and mitigating adverse childhood experiences because parents play a vital role in shaping a child’s environment and experiences.”\nAs for the children, the programme’s aim is also to provide a secure and nurturing environment for them where they feel secure and accepted, and are heard and understood.\nA recent case that Mr Baculanta encountered is an eight-year-old girl, whose father was put up at a nursing home due to deteriorating dementia. He had shown verbally violent behaviour.\nThe mother, the sole breadwinner in the family, works extra hours at night and during weekends to make ends meet.\nConfused and frustrated by the changes, the girl confided in a CareNights mentor that she had thoughts of self-harm and was curious about a “happy pill” (presumed to be a drug) that she had discovered while watching content fromYouTube.\nThe mentor immediately advised the child’s mother to limit the girl’s access to such online content. After learning about her daughter’s thoughts of self-harm, the mother also communicated the self-harm concerns to the school counsellor.\nEmphasising the importance of having trusted adults in the child’s life to buffer the impact of adverse childhood experiences, Mr Baculanta said: “Currently, the child is thriving and starting to express joyfulness despite her family situation. She feels more confident and secure, knowing that there are people (CareNights’ mentors and volunteers) aside from her family who are concerned for her well-being.”\nDr Fung from IMH said that even with such an ecosystem around a child, and social agencies and organisations may be able to provide tangible help and support, they still cannot provide the love that families can give.\n“There’s a need for love, but love is not something that I can prescribe, though I wish I could,” the child psychiatrist added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- RoundBox@Children's Society (Toa Payoh): 6259 3735 (Mon to Fri, 9am to 6pm)\n- Vox@Children's Society (Chai Chee): 6443 4139 (Mon to Fri, 9am to 6pm)\n- JYC@Children's Society (Jurong): 6566 6989 (Mon, Wed and Fri, 8.45am to 5.45pm)\n- The Fort@Children's Society (Radin Mas): 6276 5077 (Mon to Fri, 8.30am to 5.30pm)"

            "Article Body": "CHENGDU — At Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, there is a giant star. \nThousands of visitors flock to the facility in southwest China's Sichuan province every day to see four-year-old female giant panda He Hua, nicknamed Hua Hua, that people say looks like a triangular rice ball.\nVisitors reportedly queue up to three hours to catch a glimpse of the panda, state newspaper People’s Daily reported.\nAnd a line of more than 1,000 visitors wait at the gate of the facility even before it opens at 7.30am to see Hua Hua, Sichuan Television reported, a testament to its star power. \nOnline, Hua Hua has amassed a fan base as well, gaining more than 14.7 billion views on Chinese blogging platform Weibo since it was first introduced to the public in 2020.\nThe topic “giant panda He Hua” consistently received between one to three million views daily in the month of April.\nHua Hua’s charm lies in its onigiri-shaped body, which is different from other pandas due to developmental delays. \nAs a result, it is reportedly smaller, weaker and has a slower reaction time as compared to its peers.\nPeople’s Daily wrote: “When it runs, it resembles a large, moving rice ball.”\nIts distinctive eye circle— shaped like an inverted water droplet — also makes it stand out from the crowd.\nIt is not just Hua Hua’s physical appearance that draws fans. Its laidback and gentle temperament are reasons why it has grown a following online. \nIn one viral video from last November on Chinese short video platform Douyin, another panda named Run Yue at the facility repeatedly snatches away Hua Hua’s freshly peeled bamboo sticks. \nYet, Hua Hua remained unfazed, choosing to peel another bamboo stick instead. \nBy Run Yue's fourth bamboo-nabbing attempt, Hua Hua, wise to the game, simply handed over the peeled treat to its companion.\nThis video has received 14,700 likes as of Friday (April 19),\nOne viewer said: “Hua baby doesn’t snatch or put up a fight, it’s seriously so warm.”\nAnother joked: “Hua Hua’s temper is actually huge, just that it cannot win the fight.”\nHowever, it seems that Hua Hua has deployed some tricks in recent times to push back against the antics of its companions.\nIn another viral Douyin video posted last September, Hua Hua is munching on an apple slice and Run Yue, nicknamed Second Dog, tries to snatch it.\nThis time, Hua Hua successfully blocks its attempts with its paw, without even sparing a glance at Run Yue.\nIn another instance, when Run Yue tries to steal its peeled bamboo again, Hua Hua does a switcheroo and hands Run Yue bamboo skin instead, savouring the peeled bamboo stick when Run Yue leaves.\nThis fighting spirit has earned Hua Hua the nickname “Niu Hu Lu flower” (钮祜禄花) a Chinese internet slang that describes someone who has grown a backbone and become stronger.\nDouyin user “Morningdawn” commented: “Our Hua baby is very clever.”\nAnother wrote: “Hua Hua is playing tricks again.” \nTurns out, Hua Hua is part of a family of famous pandas.\nIts mother Cheng Gong is known as the \"Princess of Cleanliness\", for its impeccable grooming habits and regal air. Hua Hua's father Mei Lan was born in the United States.\nBig brother Gong Zai was apparently the inspiration for the main character Po from American animation blockbuster Kung Fu Panda.\nHua Hua also has a twin sister named He Ye, which was previously thought to be male. He Ye was found to be female in January after its biological samples were tested, Chinese media reported.\nThe \"giant panda craze\" has fuelled consumption in China, with numerous cultural shops in Chengdu and across the country selling panda-related merchandise, the Global Times from China reported.\nAnd the craze over pandas is not restricted to China alone.\nFans are seen fawning over Hua Hua in a video by TikTok user \"indipine\" posted last Sunday, which has received more than 1.8 million views as of Friday.\nA fan wrote: \"Hua Hua is my favourite celebrity.\" \nSome crowned it as panda royalty: \"Hua Hua is the princess of China.\"\nOthers related to its unusual cuddly shape: \"I must admit, I am very much Hua Hua-shaped.\"\nAnother TikTok user remarked: \"Not to be dramatic, but I would give anything for that panda.\"\nWell, how could anyone say now to that cute and round face?"

            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — Some people may bond over hobbies such as cycling or cooking, and then there are those who rally around the use of bidets.\nAt Toilets with Bidets Singapore, a community of bidet users have banded together to collate information on all the public toilets equipped with bidets in Singapore. \nCreated by a Singaporean bidet user who is 24 years old and wanted to be known as just \"R\", Toilets with Bidets Singapore features a map of public toilets with bidets on Google Maps that serves as a handy online guide for people who want to do their business in peace and wash up well at a public toilet.\nLaunched in 2022, Ms R told TODAY that there were fewer than 30 pinned locations at the time. \nWhen TODAY checked on Wednesday (April 17), there were now more than 270 pinned locations of toilets with bidets on this map across the island. \nTODAY understands that the page has since garnered around 900,000 views and the recent interest in it came after a video featuring the map went viral.\nBased on the map, the central area seems like the best district if you need a bidet, with 108 of them identified. A bidet is a plumbing fixture with a tap for a toilet bowl user to wash the backside and genitalia.\nMs R, whose full-time job is an administrator, told TODAY that, as a bidet user, she found it hard to find bidets in public washrooms. Previously, her online searches for them had been futile as well. \nAfter coming across a tweet in 2021 that wished for an application that can locate all the bidet toilets in Singapore, she then decided that she had to do something.\n“I did the next best thing (at that time) and created an Instagram account.\" \nShe started off with her personal list of toilets with bidets that she had found, but later, her followers began submitting information to her on other bidets they had discovered.  \nAfter the pool of information continued to grow, Ms R realised that dumping all the data points into a tool such as Google Maps would be easier for users. \nThe data collection took about six months before she received enough submissions to start a map, Ms R said.\n“I think I’ve found a very wholesome community that helps each other out.” \nIn a video posted last Saturday on the Toilets with Bidets Singapore’s Instagram page that featured the map of bidet toilets, one person wrote: “Thank you for your service.”\nAnother said: “Not the hero we need, but the hero we deserve.” \nInstagram user “asanahcamper” echoed similar sentiments: “I follow you because I previously have nightmares finding a toilet with bidet in Singapore... thank you for your initiative!”\nIt seems like Ms R was not the only one who thought of this idea, as one person wrote: “I had this idea, too, I sometimes joke that we're a third world country because we're not stocked with bidet.”\nOver on the TikTok account of Toilets with Bidets Singapore, some people spoke about what they had to endure due to the shortage of toilets with bidets here.\nTikTok user \"mintyyy\" noted that even if a toilet has water points, it is not guaranteed that a bidet would be installed: \"The most criminal thing is sometimes, there are water points by the toilet bowl, but no attached bidets, as if taunting you.\"\nAnother TikTok user asked: \"Why doesn’t Singapore like bidets?\"\nIt seems that some visitors to Singapore have asked a similar question, expressing dismay at the lack of bidets in public washrooms.\nOne online user said: \"Why didn't I see this, I was in Singapore last week and needed a bidet.\" \nAnother person heading here soon found the map a useful resource: \"Going to Singapore tomorrow.

            "Article Summary": "An American TikToker living in Singapore has been gaining online attention for learning Singlish.\nThe popular videos feature the man's tongue-in-cheek application of colloquial terms such as \"buay tahan\" and \"lagi\".\nIn response, many netizens have chimed in with their witty take on how to use Singlish.\nWhile most netizens praised his efforts to expand his Singlish vocabulary, others debated the use of the language",
            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — American Zenos Schmickrath is on a mission to learn and make sense of Singlish, and he is bringing the internet along for a ride with him. \nMr Schmickrath, who has been living in Singapore for 12 years, has been learning Singlish since 2021, according to his TikTok videos.\nHis recent videos, where he explores a different Singlish word in every video, have gained traction among netizens.\nIn one video, he learns the Singlish word “buay tahan” through a Singlish adaptation of The Three Little Pigs by artist Casey Chen.\n“‘Buay tahan’ means cannot stand it anymore,” he said, referring to the definition stated in the storybook. “It says ‘resistant’ here but I think it has a deeper meaning.”\nSubsequently, he began to apply the use of the commonly used local Hokkein phrase. \n“Walao eh, today damn hot 我(I) buay tahan already,” said Mr Schmickrath, uttering a sentence that most Singaporeans are probably familiar with, as he strolls down the streets.\nHe then goes about his day using the word “buay tahan” in different scenarios. He got a haircut because he “buay tahan” the length of his hair and ate some desserts that he “buay tahan” because they were too sweet.\n“If you buay tahan or cannot tahan something, it means you cannot endure it,” concluded Mr Schmickrath.\nThe video, posted on TikTok last Saturday (April 13), received over 180,000 views within three days.\nIn another video, Mr Schmickrath expands his Singlish repertoire with the word “lagi”. \nAgain, he tries to improve his Singlish vocabulary with the application of the word throughout his day. \nBut this time, he seemingly struggles a little more with his attempts.\nTurning to what seems to be a local barista in a cafe, Mr Schmickrath asks: “So ‘satu lagi’ means one more?”\n“Correct,” confirms the barista.\nThe barista then affirms that \"satu lagi\", \"lagi better\" or \"lagi shiok\" are all correct ways to use the word \"lagi\".\n“It seems like 'lagi' is one of the most difficult Singlish words to understand,” said Mr Schmickrath.\n“It sometimes means even more and other times it means again.” \nAccording to Singlish dictionary blog Singlish.net, “lagi” is a Malay word that means more, greater or further.\nStill confused about how to use the word, Mr Schmickrath turned to his viewers for answers. \n“You know I really am not getting it, if you know what ‘lagi’ really means please let me know in the comments.”\nAnd the internet answered. \n“It’s more of an emphasis or exaggeration in Singlish,” commented one TikTok user.\nUser “aroundsundown” elaborated: “Lagi + adverb = even more (lagi better, lagi pretty, lagi slow). Number + lagi = more (lima lagi = five more). Verb + lagi = again (boil water lagi, makan lagi, nak lagi).”\nMr Schmickrath’s efforts in learning Singlish won him praise from Singaporeans. \n“Wah seh bro, u sibei steady to make effort to understand Singlish,” a TikToker commented, in fluent Singlish.\nAnother thought that his command of Singlish warrants him Singapore citizenship: “Wah Singlish already so steady pom pi pi. Just take up Singapore citizenship lah, we welcome you.”\nThe official Visit Singapore TikTok account by the Singapore Tourism Board also gave its thumbs up: “We buay tahan how good you are at Singlish lah.”\nAt his request for examples of how to use the word “buay tahan”, one netizen replied in jest: “I buay tahan you sibei steady. Limpei like.”\nAnother answered: “I buay tahan your Singlish… you bo jio us go eat dessert together leh.”\nLooks like Mr Schmickrath has more Singlish words like “bo jio” and “limpeh” to add to his repertoire.\nHowever, some naysayers questioned the use of Singlish.\n“I live in Singapore and I don't bother trying to learn Singlish. Instead I always try to avoid it so I sound more professional, especially at work,” said one commenter.\nLooks like the Speak Good English Movement worked on this one.\n“Why would anyone wish to improve at Singlish?” asked another.\nTo which Mr Schmickrath replied: “Singlish is part of Singapore culture and (I find it) super interesting.\""

In our weekly Gen Zen series, TODAY looks at ways that we can feel better while coping with the mental stresses of modern life.\nSINGAPORE — Years ago, I remember chancing upon a social media clip of a man, who had lost his ability to see colour as a child, putting on EnChroma glasses for the first time. \nEnChroma glasses are a set of special lenses designed to improve the colour vision of people suffering from colour-blindness or colour deficiency.\nIt was a simple but beautiful moment as he marvelled at the ability to see different colours, something I’d taken for granted.\nA woman also left a comment under the same video narrating her husband’s own experience with EnChroma glasses, and how they had spent so much time browsing the produce section at the grocery shop after that, because he couldn’t fathom how there were so many shades of the same colour.\nThe video is just one of a collection of similar uplifting clips I’ve saved in a folder on my social media pages. \nThey run the range from a lone flower blooming in the cleft of a rock on a sidewalk, to strangers sharing about their journey of recovering from an addiction.\nI find myself turning to these videos several times a week, for an easy dose of comfort on days that feel a bit rough.\nWhile I know it isn’t therapy, these small hits of positivity do help in the moment, serving as a motivational midday pick-me-up to get through the day or week, until I can give myself the proper self-care that I need.\nI know many people around me who do this as well. Whether they have an organised folder or not, many of us turn to these little videos or collections of memes and photos frequently as a coping mechanism in a trend that has come to be known as “hopecore”.\nSocial media and mental health experts agreed that viewing positive or optimistic content could evoke feelings of “warmth, faith, and hope”, which may be a helpful perk during a stressful day.\nSuch content could also be comforting as it serves as a reminder of the transience of life and the universality of the human condition — offering viewers a way to see things from a different perspective.\nDr Andrew Yee, an assistant professor at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), whose research interests lie in the intersection between digital technology and human development, said: “As life becomes increasingly fast-paced, we may feel disassociated with other people and the world at large.\n“To find meaning, humans seek out experiences that provide a sense of resonance, to help us feel more connected to the world. \n“Seeing bite-sized content about what it means to be human, focusing on the transience of life and the moments which makes us human, can be uplifting, especially when people are caught up in the busyness of everyday life.”\nThis has been supported by research studies, which found that consuming small “doses” of uplifting content on social media, could have positive emotional consequences, Dr Yee said.\nAgreeing, the Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) pointed out that when one is feeling down, the mind may get trapped in a downward spiral, making it seem like things would never improve.\nViewing positive or optimistic content could thus serve as a reminder to see things from a different perspective, and thus potentially break the pattern of downward spiraling.\nHowever, experts cautioned against turning to such positive content as the sole means of dealing with one’s negative emotions and stressors.\nMs Glenn Woo, a therapist at Singapore-based online counselling platform Talk Your Heart Out, said that while consuming optimistic content may be helpful to some after a stressful day, it may be of little use to those facing “unrelenting challenges” who would need more help addressing deeper issues.\n“At its best, hopecore content can evoke feelings of warmth, faith and hope. But on the flip side, it has the potential to cause increased melancholy to someone who may already be struggling to feel hopeful or connected with others,” Ms Woo added.\nAgreeing, SAMH said that simply relying on hopeful content would not be enough to solve a certain problem the person is facing.\nWhile helpful, the impact of such content may ultimately be temporary if the person feels their circumstances cannot be changed.\n“More importantly, the person needs to be given the space to acknowledge the situation that they are going through and yet (be) presented with alternative perspectives. \n“Otherwise, positive content may come across as idealistic and lose the potential for positive influence and change.”\nIf viewers find that the challenging situations they are facing persist and affect their daily functioning, they may need to seek alternative support.\nSome online users have also drawn parallels between hopecore and doom scrolling — where viewers subject themselves to excessive amounts of optimistic or positive materials instead of consuming copious amounts of depressive or negative content.\nAcknowledging this, Dr Yee from SUTD said: “If social media use becomes excessive, it can (also) displace one’s time doing meaningful things that contribute to well-being.”\nOne way to check if one’s social media use is problematic is by asking ourselves if our social media use is a form of procrastination — which prevents us from doing something more worthwhile — or if it is goal-directed and used for a specific purpose in a way that does not affect other aspects of our lives too negatively.\nAnd while hopecore content can be immensely comforting, one should also be mindful of falling into the trap of toxic positivity.\nA key characteristic of hopecore content — as opposed to toxic positivity — is that the former does not seek to diminish negative feelings or encourage people to mask how they really feel.\nHowever, Ms Woo from Talk Your Heart Out said that if the content one is viewing is promoting the idea that negative feelings should be avoided or that one is “weak” for feeling them, it is very likely that such content is crossing the line into toxic positivity.\nTherefore, it is important to assess what kind of feelings are evoked through the content consumed.\n“Oftentimes, toxic positivity will evoke feelings of shame or guilt surrounding your situation or emotions, or even suggest that you should ignore the pain you feel,” Ms Woo added.\nShe advised that it may also be worthwhile to check the content’s source. \nIf there is a tendency for the creator to push content with the narrative of being positive regardless of one’s circumstance, or if there is an element of blaming viewers for not doing more to be positive or better, it is likely that the content could be leaning towards toxic positivity.\nAgreeing, Dr Yee said: “I think as long as the fundamental message (of the content) does not dismiss the realities of hardship, then I believe it does not cross over into toxic positivity. \nUltimately, experts said that it is important to contextualise the content viewed within our own situations, and to assess how it makes us feel.\n“One way for viewers to be mindful is to be aware and recognise the emotions that media content evokes in them. It really is emotion literacy in general,” Dr Yee advised.\nMs Woo said: “Social media content isn’t designed to help you with your specific issues — but can be a helpful tool to help you identify that you may need help with addressing an issue when something you view online resonates with you.\n“I would think of (hopecore content) as touching or heartwarming stories that people share when they get together, or bursts of encouragement we get from strangers.\n“But ultimately, it’s important to remember that they do not replace having a proper, deep insight or conversations about the challenges and hardships you’re facing, and how you can approach these challenges in a way that works for you.”\nAnd if one’s negative emotions still persist, it is crucial to seek alternative help, the experts said.\nFor further assistance, one can call SAMH’s toll-free helpline at 1800 283 7019 or other community mental health hotlines."

            "Article Summary": "With last year being the fourth hottest year on record since 1929, and April's daily maximum temperatures ranging between 34°C and 35°C, many in Singapore are feeling the heat .\nFor outdoor workers like Mr Mathiyalagan Karthikeyan at the frontline of a warmer climate, coping with erratic weather that swings between hot sun and sudden showers is nothing new.\nHe is familiar with various safety regulations like having hourly \"water parades\", and tries to beat the heat with proper attire and cooling fruits like watermelon.\nTODAY accompanied Mr Karthikeyan on a day in his life as a team lead at a playground construction company, to learn how he has adapted to Singapore's increasingly extreme weather",
            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — While many may welcome the past few days of break from the heat wave, for outdoor workers like Mr Mathiyalagan Karthikeyan, the recent spell of sudden showers is a disruption to his daily routine. \nFor the 43-year-old migrant worker, rising early and being under the sun for eight hours is part of his daily grind.\nNine of his 14 years in Singapore have been spent working for Ct-Art Creation, where he has helped to build more than 100 playgrounds in housing estates, parks and shopping centres. \nMr Karthikeyan is one of the workers on the frontlines of Singapore's increasingly extreme weather.\nLast year, the highest recorded temperature was a scorching 37°C in May, with 2023 also the fourth hottest year on record since 1929.\nIn October last year, the Ministry of Manpower introduced new rules, including mandatory hourly breaks when the weather is above 32°C, to protect outdoor workers from heat stress.\nWhile wetter weather has been forecast for April, the Meteorological Service Singapore said daily maximum temperatures may range between 34°C and 35°C on most days.\nTo get a better sense of how outdoor workers adapt to the increasingly extreme weather, TODAY accompanied Mr Karthikeyan for a day on the job and learnt his tips for keeping cool.\nDecked in a bright blue vest and white helmet, he led a team of six workers tasked to put the finishing touches on a treehouse-themed playground set in Geylang on Thursday (April 11).\nBut first, they had their first “water parade” of the day, where all the workers drank from their water bottles.\nThe day had started with a light drizzle and by 10.30am, it had become cloudy with the temperature at 29°C. For Mr Karthikeyan, it was a pleasant start to the day.\n“The place we came from is hotter than here, so for us, it’s just normal,” he said.\nMost of the workers are from India, where temperatures can rise to as high as 42°C during dry seasons.\nSo as I wilted in my short-sleeved shirt which had become damp due to the humidity, Mr Karthikeyan was going around inspecting the unfinished parts of the playground without much fuss.\nTo them, the cloudy weather was a nice reprieve from the earlier days in the week where temperatures hit close to 35°C in the day. \n“Last two weeks... very hot. When we hear the news that Singapore is getting hotter because of El Nino, we were all prepared,” said Mr Karthikeyan.\nBut he has heard of other outdoor workers who had suffered from heat stress, especially those who worked in less shaded areas.\nThe playground project in Geylang is surrounded on all sides by finished blocks of Build-to-Order flats, which provide cover from the sun.\n“When we go to the new sites, there is no building, it’s totally open space, so there is no shade for the whole day,” said Mr Karthikeyan, who recalled one park playground site that was “very open”.\nSoon it was time for another water break. They do this every hour, Mr Karthikeyan calling the workers together and cajoling them to “drink more”.\n“Some of them don’t like to drink water. I don’t think everyone is used to drinking more water every day and they don’t know if (what they drink) is enough or not,” he said.\nAs a team lead, he has to take photos of their water parades and send them to his bosses as proof that they are adhering to this safety regulation.\nMuch of the playground in Geylang were already in place, so the team just had to clean up the debris, attach the remaining screws and accessories, and then do the flooring.\nThe weather, however, had other ideas.\nJust over an hour after the team started work, it began to pour — lightly at first, before it became a deluge.\nMr Karthikeyan said the fluctuating weather is different from what he experienced in his home state of Tamil Nadu in India. \n“Back home it’s not like this, we have seasons. When it’s rainy season, it’s two, three months always raining, sometimes with typhoons… In Singapore, it’s 50-50, hot and cold,” he said.\nHe uses an application on his phone to check the weather across Singapore, which allows him to assess if he and his men should head to another site.\nWith work interrupted by the rain, Mr Karthikeyan and his team took an early lunch at around 11.30am. While heat stress is always a concern, he is clear when I asked if he would rather it rain.\n“No. If it’s raining, then we need to work overtime if you want to follow the schedule. If (it’s) raining (and workers) work outdoors, they will get sick because it is cold then very hot. Then the next day they take MC.” \nWhile the workers are equipped with ponchos, Mr Karthikeyan said that they are used only during light rain. For safety, work grinds to a halt during heavier downpours or when there is a lightning alert.\n“Everyone prefers the whole day having the same weather so you can finish up your work fast, go back home and rest and do whatever you like,” said Mr Karthikeyan. \n“Now we see it’s sunny, cloudy, rainy. No one can predict the weather here.”\nMr Karthikeyan is prepared for all eventualities; he has in his bag a fresh set of clothes to change into after working up a sweat or being caught in the rain.\nGloves are also essential to protect workers’ hands from getting burnt, as their tools and the playgrounds can become hot to the touch by the afternoon after being exposed to the sun.\nMr Karthikeyan showed me his tricks for keeping cool. He would wear a long-sleeved cotton shirt and a hat under his helmet to protect from the sun’s glare on hotter days.\nWhat he eats also matters.\nAs a sweet treat and means to beat the heat, he has arranged for slices of watermelon for the workers’ tea break at 3pm.\n“For those who want to work outside, make sure to wear fully covered clothes, drink plenty of water. Eat some fruits, like papaya, watermelon — not durian,” he advised with a smile."

            "Article Summary": "Former national athlete Neoh Yi Hui felt “lost” in the initial weeks after he retired from competitive dodgeball .\nWhere team trainings and meetings used to take up the bulk of his time, empty spaces now marked his calendar.\nThe absence of dodgeball hits harder because of what it means to him — he helped to build the scene in Singapore where there was none.\nWhile he is largely at peace with the decision now, the feeling of wanting to compete never really goes away.\nA period of reflection by digging “into his soul” helped him refocus his efforts on what he wanted to achieve post-retirement",
            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — It was August 2018. The stage was New York City’s Madison Square Garden, the same 19,500-seater arena where the likes of Muhammad Ali and Michael Jordan once competed in, but Neoh Yi Hui and his intrepid teammates weren't overawed.\nSingapore's mixed dodgeball team were one step away from making history, taking on a bigger and more powerful South African outfit, a side that spanked them 12-4 in an earlier round, for a spot in the World Invitational mixed final at the World Cup.\nAfter a fierce 30-minute battle of skill, strategy and athleticism, it was the unheralded Singapore team that prevailed 12-4, turning the tables on the South Africans for a final date with Japan.\nSingapore eventually lost 11-17 to Japan in the final, but Mr Neoh and his teammates had already etched their names in the history books. It was the first time Singapore had finished on the podium.\nMr Neoh recalls his teammates rushing towards him, tears of jubilance in their eyes.\nThese scenes often get replayed in his mind but he will never get to relive them again. He retired as a dodgeball player in February 2022, 12 years after it all began. He left the Dodgeball Association of Singapore (DAS), too.\n“The first few days of waking up after retiring, it hit me quite hard that I’m really out of the scene,” said Mr Neoh. \nEach day had a clear purpose before — be it training or attending team meetings — but now the empty spaces on his calendar made him feel \"lost\".\n“It was one of the hardest things I had to do because I really loved the sport,” he said.\nHe loved it so much that he had helped to build the scene in Singapore where there was none, playing a key role in starting the DAS, paying for expenses out of his own pocket when the sport had zero funding.\nThe 38-year-old spoke to this reporter at a park in Kovan on Tuesday (April 9), a week after former national swimmer Joseph Schooling hung up his goggles for good.\nMr Neoh's reasons for retiring were similar. He felt he could no longer keep up with the younger athletes. “Physically, I may not be able to ‘bring it’ as much,” he said.\nBut coming to terms with that decision was not easy at first.\nIn the weeks after he walked away from dodgeball, everything reminded him of the sport, and reminiscing about the glory days like those in 2018 was a regular occurrence.\nHe is largely at peace with the decision now, but the feeling of wanting to compete never really goes away.\n“The ‘player’ part of me wishes I never retired. Your body still really wants in.\n“But sometimes you just have to bite the bullet and let it go, and try to think of other ways to help the sport,” he said.\nThis initial reluctance to fully let go is not surprising, considering that for many athletes, their journey had been paved with heaps of memories and personal sacrifices. \nFor Mr Neoh, the absence of dodgeball hits harder because of what the game means to him.\nAs a kid he used to pack ping pong and tennis balls into his backpack some 30 years ago, eagerly awaiting the ring of the school bell to rush to the courtyard for a game of hantam bola (\"hitting with a ball\" in Malay) with his buddies.  \nThe rules of hantam bola were simple enough: Hit your opponent with a ball and you’ll eliminate them. Catch a thrown ball and revive a teammate. Your team wins if the opponents are all eliminated. \nDodgeball is largely the same, played by teams comprising six players a side, but it has more rules. \nIt is also a game that can be played by anyone, even if its players have their own shortcomings. \nThese are what drew Mr Neoh to it when he first started out in 2010.\n“In primary school, I wanted to play basketball but my coach said I was too short,” he said, adding that such superficial requirements don’t exist in dodgeball.\n“In dodgeball, even if you can’t throw a ball, you can always contribute to the offence by catching a ball, drawing the opponent’s attention, or dodging. You can do so many things… We cover each other this way.\n“That’s why our team in Singapore comprises so many different types of people with different strengths.\n“It really gives everyone — of different shapes and sizes — a chance to play.”\nThis desire to provide a sport for society’s keen misfits to compete in was what drove Mr Neoh to give his all to dodgeball, helping to raise its profile along the way.\nOver 12 years, Mr Neoh racked up accolade after accolade in local and international tournaments for both his club, Outkast International, and country.\nHe did so all while wearing multiple hats — player, head coach, president of the DAS. But admittedly, he wasn’t always sure that his struggles would pay off.\nHe doesn't earn a single cent from playing. The DAS does not pay those who represent the national team, nor do they win prize money for the tournaments they participate in.\n“My father called me stupid. I left my full-time job that was paying quite well to run the DAS full time, with no pay, for six to eight years,” he said, adding that he took up odd jobs and did freelance coaching to get by. \n“My wife and I also decided to put plans for our family, like having a baby, on hold. That’s another couple of years of not taking care of ourselves, not going on extended holidays, just so we could take care of the team.”\nHe confessed to never being there for his family on weekends due to training.\nFurthermore, as the DAS is not recognised as one of the 70 official National Sports Associations, funding for the dodgeball team was often hard to come by.\nMr Neoh, who did not grow up in a rich family, estimates that he had used “six figures” of his own money to push the game to greater heights in Singapore.\nThis included the cost of running local events, sending teams overseas for tournaments, and other miscellaneous things like jerseys and equipment.\nThere were times when he had a meagre S$50 to his name.\n“S$50 in a full-grown man’s bank account,” he remarked with a chuckle and quiet disbelief.\n“I was so down, man”.\nAlthough Mr Neoh has a keen interest in many sports (he still plays basketball and bowling, and kayaks on a regular basis), dodgeball holds a special place in his heart. \nIt was why when he decided to quit, it took him a few weeks to cope with his decision. The turning point, he said, came when he “dug deep into my soul”.\nAfter years of sacrifices, he and his wife — then the head coach of Hong Kong’s national dodgeball team — realised that they had accomplished most of what they had set out to achieve.\nSo it dawned upon him that it was “time for us to take care of ourselves and give ourselves a chance”. This meant giving time for other important facets of life.\nThere are many things that keep Mr Neoh busy these days. In addition to providing sports enrichment classes for children and being a freelance coach, he also runs a nutrition-focused dessert shop and gym based in Hong Kong together with his wife.\nBut Mr Neoh is not done with dodgeball just yet. A palpable tenacity exists in his otherwise jovial voice when asked about his goals for the country’s dodgeball scene.\nTo get consistent funding for the DAS. To run a tournament in a shopping mall to raise publicity. To legitimise dodgeball so others may one day play it professionally and for a living.\nBut for now, that isn’t quite the priority.\nAt his Sengkang flat, all the medals he had won over the years were stashed away to make room for the prize that has eluded him all these years — a baby boy. Mr Neoh and his wife are expecting their first child in June.\n“The next drive for me is definitely family. I want to let my son know that daddy and mummy have been top athletes who did well,” he said.\n“And hopefully, he gets some of our genes and can also be good.”"

            "Article Summary": "An increasing number of Singaporeans are exploring property options in Johor, motivated by lower costs and lifestyle benefits .\nWhile the current strong demand may be attributed to the relaunch of the RTS Link project and the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) announcement, property experts said it is primarily due to housing costs and inflation in Singapore.\nBuyers are snapping up units in Johor Bahru and Iskandar Puteri for various uses, such as a second home, as an investment or to live in.\nHowever, caution is advised, as experiences vary. Some who bought properties in Iskandar Malaysia during the hype 10 years ago have faced losses due to political shifts and oversupply.\nUltimately, prospective buyers are urged to adopt a local mindset rather than that of a Singaporean, and to wait for concrete progress on infrastructure projects before committing to a purchase",
            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — Living in her newly bought three-bedroom condominium in Johor Bahru, Kylie Hung, 27, enjoys all the perks of homeownership as a singleton before hitting 30 — something she is unable to do back in Singapore. \nAnd her work as a digital entrepreneur allows her to have total control of her time, which means she does not need to contend with the congestion at the Causeway during peak hours. \nMs Hung moved into her Country Garden Danga Bay condominium seven months ago, where she has access to features such as a pool, butler service and a private beach. \nMs Hung said she had wanted to move out of her parents' house as she needed her own quiet space, which she felt would help her better focus at work. \nBut private property in Singapore was out of her reach, and she could not buy a Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat as the minimum age eligibility for singles is 35.\n“If I were to rent a place in Singapore alone, the money would go out of my pocket to something that I don’t own,\" she said.\n“So I looked at Johor Bahru properties and thought that it made better sense for me to buy. My monthly mortgage would be around the same price as renting a room back home.\" \nMs Hung took out a bank loan to finance her 1,237 sq ft abode, which cost around RM700,000 (S$200,000). She currently pays about RM3,500 (S$1,000) a month for the mortgage and maintenance fees. \nWhile she's happy with her purchase, she acknowledged that moving to Johor Bahru works for her because of her job’s flexibility, and it might not be for everyone.\n“For those working 9am to 6pm, I wouldn’t recommend it because the jam on the Causeway can be quite bad.” \nEven so, buying property in Johor was all the hype among Singaporeans about a decade ago, when Iskandar Malaysia, the main southern economic corridor in Johor, opened for business.\nThe draw for those Singaporeans was much the same as for Ms Hung: The ability to own and live in a luxury home at a much lower price than its equivalent in Singapore.\nSince then, TODAY has found that there are those who are pleased they made the leap and those who regret it.\nMr Eric Sim, who bought two four-bedroom units of 2,400 sq ft each near JB Sentral in 2014, said the investment had left a bad taste in his mouth until today. \nEach unit of four bedrooms and six bathrooms was financed with a bank loan after a 10 per cent down payment. \nAlthough prospects looked good then, driven by economic development and mega infrastructure projects such as the Kuala Lumpur–Singapore high-speed rail (HSR), things subsequently went downhill. \n“I bought them as an investment because I thought (Iskandar) would be the next Shenzhen. But it was just an illusion,” the 54-year-old career book author lamented. \n“I realised after buying that there were no big companies in Johor Bahru, whereas, in Shenzhen, there are Tencent, Huawei, and Shenzhen Airlines. So, there won’t be any high-salary talent attraction to support the high property prices.”\nThree more factors threw Mr Sim’s plans out of kilter: The onslaught of new projects raised supply above demand, the 2018 Malaysian general election culminated in a change in government and policies, such as the cancellation of the HSR project and lastly, the ringgit continued to weaken against the Singapore dollar. \nWhen he invested in his properties in 2014, S$1 was about RM2.60. In February this year, the Singapore dollar rose to a record high of RM3.55.\nMr Sim found it difficult to rent out his properties. Even if he had found tenants, the rental would not have been enough to cover his monthly upkeep due to the exchange rate, he said. \nHe finally sold both units this year, at a loss. His total investment cost him a little over RM3 million, but he incurred a loss of RM500,000. \n“It was the worst investment of my life,” Mr Sim said. \nEven so, interest in Johor homes remains high among Singaporeans. In January, for example, there was some hype over properties near Bukit Chagar — where the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) Link station is located — after a commemorative ceremony attended by then-Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. \nBut real estate experts told TODAY that rising inflation and property prices at home are the more important reasons driving Singaporean homebuyers up north.\nThe RTS Link is slated to start passenger service by the end of 2026. Once operational, it is expected to ease bottlenecks on the Causeway, allowing easier access across the border. \nThe consistent demand, not just from Singaporeans but investors worldwide too, has buoyed property prices in Johor, which have risen threefold since 2010, according to data from Malaysia’s National Property Information Centre (Napic). \nBut other news events paint a less rosy picture of the Johor property market.\nLast year, Forest City, the flagship US$100 billion (S$135 billion) mega-project by Chinese developer Country Garden, was dubbed a “ghost town” by the media as the housing estates there were reportedly largely unoccupied.  \nSome buyers, including Singaporeans, were cited by international news outlets expressing disappointment and regret over their investments. A handful said they were fortunate to have sold off their units before the situation took a turn for the worse. \nIn 2022, over at Country Garden Danga Bay, disgruntled owners from Singapore, Malaysia, and China filed a class-action lawsuit against the developer, alleging that the developer's luxury condominium was not delivered as advertised.\nSo, for potential investors or homeowners mulling whether to leap into the Johor property market, it can be quite difficult to figure out what the wise decision would be.\nTODAY examines the reasons behind the current influx of Singaporean buyers in Johor, what they look for in a Johor property and the key things one should consider before putting money down on a house across the border.\nWhen Singaporeans think of Johor, it is typically the Johor Bahru area that comes to mind, but in fact, the state government’s plans to drive Johor’s economic growth extend beyond the city centre. \nIskandar Malaysia comprises the Johor Bahru District, Kulai District and part of the Pontian District. Officially launched in 2006, it encompasses an area of 2,217 sq km, nearly three times the size of Singapore. \nSome of the major cities in Iskandar include Johor Bahru city centre, Iskandar Puteri (where Legoland is) and Pasir Gudang, one of the largest industrial areas in Malaysia. \nThe launch of Iskandar was aimed at attracting international investments that would drive economic growth for the state. And within Iskandar is the township development of Medini, envisioned as Iskandar Puteri’s central business district (CBD). Here, there are no restrictions on foreign homeownership.\nGenerally, foreigners buying properties in Johor must adhere to a minimum purchase price of RM1 million. However, exemptions are granted to certain projects, especially if they were approved before the threshold was implemented on May 1, 2014. \nUntil recently, the piece de resistance of Iskandar was supposed to be Forest City, a colossal luxury real estate project on four man-made islands in the Johor Strait, overlooking the Singapore border. \nLaunched in 2013, Forest City was envisioned as a futuristic, green, and smart city. It is Chinese developer Country Garden's largest overseas project, and was planned to house 700,000 people by 2035.\nDespite its ambitious vision, the project encountered several challenges and controversies due to a mix of low sales, Chinese restrictions on capital outflows, border closures during the pandemic and public backlash against China's increasing influence in Malaysia.\nLast August, the developer said the project was proceeding as planned despite issues involving \"political landscape and interference, economic stability, government policy\".\nIn December 2023, CNA reported that only 15 per cent of the entire project had been completed. According to the developer, a total of 28,000 residential units have been completed, with 80 per cent of these units sold to buyers from over 30 countries. \nAround 9,000 residents are said to live in Forest City. TODAY has reached out to Country Garden for the latest figures. \nIn an attempt to spur economic development and attract investors, Forest City was announced as a Special Financial Zone (SFZ) last August. With this designation, businesses are offered incentives to set up operations here, such as a flat income tax rate of 15 per cent instead of the usual 30 per cent, for skilled foreign workers. \nIn preparation for the SFZ designation, Country Garden is building a new Customs checkpoint, which is expected to be completed by the end of this year. It also announced that several transportation-related infrastructure projects within the massive enclave are in progress.   \nSome international media outlets reported in April that talks were being held on opening a casino in Forest City, citing unnamed sources. But Prime Minister Anwar was quick to squash all talk with an “affirmative no” to the idea. \nDespite the negative news around Forest City, the relaunch of the RTS Link project by Singapore and Malaysia may have renewed Singaporeans’ interest in owning property across the border. \nMr Tan Kin Lian, a two-time presidential candidate, is among those who have long appreciated the merits of owning a second home there. In 2018, he purchased a 1,100 sq ft three-bedroom unit in Forest City for about RM1.6 million, paid fully in cash. \nHe makes the 2.5-hour journey across Tuas Second Link by public transport twice or thrice a month and stays there three days each time. \nWhen this TODAY reporter met the 76-year-old at his Johor abode on May 18, a Saturday, he seemed very much at home. He said he enjoys the peace and tranquillity, as well as the unblocked view of Johor’s greenery from his balcony. \nFor a place where supposedly 9,000 residents are staying, this reporter found it unusually quiet for a weekend. On Mr Tan’s floor, where there are eight units, he said only his was occupied. \nAs this TODAY reporter travelled across the vast expanse of Forest City via an hourly shuttle bus, only one other passenger boarded it. \nThere were some signs of life at Forest City’s transport hub, though, where one can find a good mix of restaurants, retail shops, and a convenience mart open for business. Still, some shop lots were either closed or boarded up, awaiting prospective tenants. \nNotwithstanding the controversies and rather muted environment, Mr Tan said he is happy with his decision to buy a Forest City unit as he believes in the project’s potential. He also found himself drawn to the “modern city design”. \nForest City also appeals to Malaysian workers who work in Singapore, as rental prices are reasonable. Among its residents is Mr Afiq Alwi, a 40-year-old truck driver who is currently renting a 600 sq ft unit with two bedrooms for RM1,000. \nHe said that the rate at Forest City was cheaper compared with units for rent in nearby towns in Iskandar Puteri, such as Gelang Patah: “For the same unit, I’d be paying RM1,600 there.” \n“I like working in Singapore, but it’s expensive to live there because one room can cost minimally S$700 to S$800. For less than that price in ringgit, I can comfortably rent an entire unit all to myself here.” \nSix property agents TODAY spoke to said that while a significant number of Singaporeans are looking to buy Johor homes for investment, there are also those looking to live there or have a second home. \nOperations director Victor Lee, 53, and his wife Crystal Wang, 38, are among the latter. When TODAY met the couple on May 15, they had just collected the keys to their two-bedroom unit at R&F Princess Cove, a condominium project said to be popular among Singaporean buyers.  \nMr Lee said they paid for the RM800,000, 834 sq ft unit in full, using cash.\nThanks to a flexi-work arrangement — he can spend one or two days working from home each week — Mr Lee, who is in the energy sector, said he is happy with the purchase.\n“R&F is near my workplace in Admiralty West. You can see it from my balcony. So geographically, I’m at an advantage,” he said. \nAsked if he would brave the notorious congestion on the Causeway several times a week, Mr Lee said there have been promising improvements, with both governments constantly making efforts to smoothen the travel process, such as the recent implementation of electronic gates. \n“There are pros and cons. If you live in Singapore, the major expressways are always jammed, and there’s ERP (Electronic Road Pricing) to consider. It’s a trade-off I can live with.”  \nBefore buying this Johor house, the couple had been renting a studio unit in Singapore for S$2,000 monthly. Mr Lee also owns an HDB flat where his parents live.\n“We decided to look to JB and thought, instead of renting, why don’t we put our money into a place we can call our own?” he said. \nOn safety concerns in Johor Bahru, Mr Lee said he would do his best to take precautions, such as avoiding going out alone at night and in dark alleyways.\nA Singaporean father of two, who wanted to be known only as Mr Afiq for privacy reasons (not to be confused with Mr Afiq Alwi above), is looking to buy a property in Johor within the next 12 months.\nFor the last six months, he has been renting a 1,500 sq ft double-storey terrace house in Horizon Hills, Iskandar Puteri, with his wife and two kids, aged six and nine, for RM3,500 a month, and he likes the lifestyle there. \nMr Afiq, who works in finance, said before moving there, he had been entertaining the thought of relocating to Johor as he can work remotely most of the time. \nIt was when his wife decided to quit her job as an agricultural scientist to recover from burnout that he mooted the idea and she agreed. \n“One main reason that pushed me to move my family here was so that I could send my kids to an international school, where they get to learn Chinese as a required subject and socialise in a melting pot of different nationalities,” he said. \nThe difference in cost of living was another push factor, as Mr Afiq is currently spending S$20,000 a year on his kids’ education. If he were to do the same in Singapore, he estimated that he would easily be paying twice or thrice that amount. \n“At this point, I can confidently say that we plan to move to Johor for the long term. Unless there are big regulatory changes, we'll probably live in Johor for the next two to five years.” \nRegarding security, Mr Afiq said every city or state has different security standards in different areas, and the same goes for Johor. \n“I know from my Malaysian friends that certain areas in Johor are considerably poorer, where the likelihood of you being robbed or your car being broken into is quite high. \n“But that’s why staying in a gated community helps. My family and I are also not flashy people. I own a cheap entry-level local car so that we can get around easily. We try to avoid unsafe areas.” \nIn contrast to those who bought the apartments to live in, the picture is less rosy for investors including those who entered the Johor property market 10 years ago.  \nA supply chain manager who wished to be known only as Mr Lee invested in a property the same year as Mr Sim, the author who sold off his units at a loss.\nMr Lee bought an RM1.7 million double-story cluster house in Horizon Hills. The 2,514 sq ft house has five bedrooms and five bathrooms, and he financed the purchase with a bank loan. \n“The Johor property market was booming, so my friends also bought properties in Johor as investments. I expected to be able to sell my house within five years and make a profit due to capital appreciation,” said the 40-year-old. \nHowever, things did not go as planned. In his view, the launch of Forest City “killed the property market”. \n“There’s an oversupply of units because of the project. We did not expect the developers from China to come in that fast. If I were to sell now, I would be looking at a loss,” said Mr Lee. \n“I kind of regret buying the property because I could have put the money to better use. If given a choice, I wouldn’t have done it.” \nMr Lee told TODAY that he is still holding onto his unit. He hopes the newly announced plans, such as the Singapore-Johor Special Economic Zone (SEZ) and RTS Link, would eventually drive up demand and prices. \nMr Sim said most buyers, like himself, tend to get caught up in thinking that buying property in Johor is lucrative simply because “the psf (price per square foot) is so cheap... cheaper than HDB.” \nBut he said there are other factors to consider. For example, in Singapore condominiums, units typically require “some curtains and lights” before being deemed viable for rental, he noted. \n“But in Malaysia, it’s not like that. You need to do up the cabinet and kitchen, not just curtains and lights. So, with everything considered, I would need to spend about RM80,000 for my units just to get them in good condition before renting them out. \n“So I thought I might as well not rent them out because it would jeopardise my chances of selling the units off eventually,” he said. \nDespite stories like Mr Lee's and Mr Sim's, overall demand for Johor property has stayed strong.\nData from Malaysia’s Napic shows that the property price index for Johor state, which was given a value of 100 in the base year of 2010, soared to 313.3 in 2023, which means prices more than tripled on average.\nThe increase is more drastic for Johor Bahru, as the price index stands at 400 in 2023, from the same base year value of 100. \nIn Singapore, based on the Urban Redevelopment Authority Realis data, the property price index climbed from 125.1 in the first quarter of 2010 to 204 in the first quarter of this year, a 63 per cent increase. \nMeanwhile, PropertyGuru Singapore country manager Dr Tan Tee Khoon said that as of April this year, demand for residential homes in Johor Bahru recorded an increase of “close to three times” since October 2019. \nThis is based on the firm’s \"demand index\", which calculates the number of visitors to property listings, weighted by their engagement and search behaviour. \nThe demand index for residential homes for rent in Johor Bahru also experienced a significant jump after the reopening of the Johor-Singapore border in February 2022, he said, and since then, rental demand has remained largely stable.\nUsing asking prices for service residences as a proxy for price movement, the median psf was RM488.75 as of April 2024, up from RM397.35 in March 2022, he said, adding that this was also higher than the pre-Covid median price of RM449.07 psf. \n“Notably, nearly 44 per cent of property seekers looking for a residential property in Johor Bahru in April 2024 were from Singapore.”\nDr Tan cited several reasons that contributed to this, such as the full reopening of the Republic’s international borders on April 1, 2022, which significantly boosted the demand for homes in Johor Bahru, particularly among Malaysians working in Singapore. \n“High rents and a strong Singaporean currency make owning a home in Johor Bahru more attractive. Additionally, the announcement of the SEZ and RTS further drove up rental prices.” \nMr Faizul Ridzuan, chief executive officer of property investment firm Far Capital, agreed.\n“In Singapore, property values have gone up by 30 to 40 per cent in 24 months. After Covid, rentals have gone up by 60 per cent,” he told TODAY. \n“There’s nothing new or sexy about Johor. It’s been like this for years. This time around, the primary push factors are coming from Singapore, as the cost of living has gone up substantially in the last 12 to 24 months, forcing people to look for cheaper alternatives, along with the devaluation of the Malaysian ringgit against SGD.” \nReal estate negotiator Edward Lee said Singapore’s housing policies, which levy a higher stamp duty on second and subsequent properties, also contributed to the increase in demand. \n“Once the RTS is completed, I believe property prices will be even higher than today,” he added. \nThe hot Johor property market has led some to wonder whether there would be any spillover effect on the prices of HDB flats at housing estates near the Woodlands Checkpoint, like Woodlands town itself.\nBut Ms Wong Siew Ying, head of research and content at PropNex Realty, said she believes that the HDB prices and rental trends in Woodlands generally align with overall market movement in Singapore, rather than specific locational attributes. \n“That said, transaction activity, particularly HDB resale and rental activity, has been gaining some traction recently for Woodlands town,” she said. \nThe HDB resale volume in Woodlands has seen a year-on-year increase since 2021. In 2022, there was a year-on-year increase of 14.2 per cent, while 2023 recorded a 10 per cent jump. \nMs Wong said that this can be attributed to overall improvements in infrastructure and ongoing efforts to transform the estate into a commercial hub, which has helped boost the quality of life and employment opportunities within the area.\n“The recent opening of the Thomson-East Coast Line has also greatly improved connectivity... Proximity to well-established amenities such as schools, malls, and the Causeway are all perks that further boost its popularity among residents.” \nAll things considered, is investing in a property in Johor a worthwhile investment? Property experts and homeowners advise prospective buyers to do their homework thoroughly before making a decision. \nMr Sim, the former investment banker, said one should refrain from following investment trends without research.\n“If I could turn back time, I would do a little more research on the economic activities in the area. I would also check the housing supply – not the number of units available at that point in time, but the amount of land and whether property developers would build more.\n“If I had done my homework back in 2014, I would've found information that other developers had plans to go big,” he said, referring to Forest City. \nReal estate agent Ryan Khoo, who deals with properties in Johor, said it's a good idea to look into the developer’s background before making a purchase. \n“Look for reputable ones that are publicly listed and have solid track records. For example, they have built existing projects in Johor or other parts of Malaysia that you can visit.” \nMr Faizul of Far Capital stressed the importance of looking at a property in Malaysia through the lens of a local, instead of a Singaporean.\n“When you use a Singaporean mindset to buy a property in Johor, it's suicidal,” he said, since the buyer may end up overpaying for their purchase. \nIllustrating his point, Mr Faizul said the average property price in Johor 10 years ago, including high-rise and landed units, was about RM300,000. \n“When Singaporeans come in, they pay way more than that. Perhaps over RM500,000 to RM1 million, whereas the average local only pays RM300,000. When you overpay, the probability of profit will be greatly reduced.” \nWhen investing based on the potential of future infrastructure and amenities, Mr Faizul advised prospective buyers to be patient and only make the move when there is concrete movement for the projects.  \n“Like the RTS, when you see movements from both governments, then you know for sure it won’t be cancelled. (Wait until things are) built first, instead of investing during the talking stage.\n“I’ll give you an analogy. You commit to someone who is serious about you. Just because your friend comes and tells you about this person who is ideal, rich, and good-looking, it doesn’t mean you stop doing your due diligence, and marry the person straight away, right?”\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this article said that Dr Tan Tee Khoon was the country manager of PropertyGuru Malaysia. He is the country manager of PropertyGuru Singapore. We are sorry for the error."

            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — For new mother Nur Sabrina Muhleseddin, being able to enjoy work-life balance is something she values in a job, as it allows her to be present for her son’s milestones.\nThe 29-year-old digital marketing manager said her priorities have shifted since she gave birth in July last year. She was working in a different company previously, but had sought out a new role four months after becoming a mother.\nBeing able to balance work with caring for her son is especially important to Ms Nur Sabrina, whose husband works in the hospitality industry as a shift manager — often having to work irregular hours and on weekends.\nHer flexible work post-pregnancy would mean that at least one of them — herself or her husband — can be present for their child, she said.\nCurrently, she works almost entirely from home, save for a few in-person meetings with her clients at their offices about once or twice a week.\n“I think presently, nothing is more important than to be able to witness my son growing up and being around for his milestones.\n“I’ve had a good few years of working up the ladder. Right now, I just need a job so that I can provide food on the table and share the bills with my husband,” said Ms Nur Sabrina.\nEchoing her sentiments is 29-year-old Ms Chua, who works in a human resource software company.\nThe marketing specialist, who declined to give her full name to prevent identification by her employer, started her career in a public relations agency which “didn’t provide for much work-life balance.”\n“I felt it was really tiring not only at work, but it also fed off my energy with my friends and family as well, and I didn’t have the capacity to do that.”\nAs such, when she was looking for a new job, Ms Chua hunted specifically for roles that could give her the work-life balance she was seeking.\nToday, Ms Chua is employed by an Australian company, which allows her to perform her role 100 per cent remotely from Singapore.\nMs Chua, who is married, said she is hoping to also start a family in the future, so having such flexibility is crucial to her.\nTo her, being able to be present — not just at work, but also with her friends and family — is key to building an all-round holistic life, she added.\nThe approach embraced by Ms Nur Sabrina and Ms Chua reflects a growing shift among Singapore workers towards prioritising work-life balance — with many recognising that work is not everything, along with a desire to also spend more time on personal pursuits.\nAlluding to this shift in a speech after being sworn in as Singapore’s fourth prime minister on Wednesday (May 15), Mr Lawrence Wong said: “They (younger Singaporeans) will strive and work hard for their goals, but they do not wish to be trapped in an endless rat race of hyper-competition.\n“They want a refreshed Singapore Dream — one that is not defined by material success alone, but also offers meaning and purpose in their careers and lives.”\nHe added that the Government would thus find “new ways to be productive and innovative”, and to help a new generation of workers “achieve a better balance where work is purposeful, and life is meaningful”.\nOne of the ways this is being explored is through flexible work options, which allow employees to carve out a suitable work-life rhythm tailored to their individual needs at different life stages.\nFrom December this year, all firms in Singapore will be required to have a formal process in place for their employees to request for flexible working arrangements.\nThe release of the guidelines last month has also reignited debate on the issue of work-life balance and flexible work, which has long attracted polarising sentiments — even to the extent of some questioning whether Singapore workers have increasingly lost their hunger and drive.\nIn the wake of the announcement, some employers had also come out to say that they may even rethink hiring local staff, and instead look overseas for recruitment.\nSpeaking to TODAY, Mr Suhaimi Salleh, chief executive officer of consultancy and professional training firm SSA Group, said it is crucial to consider the “broader implications” of demanding better work-life balance and flexible work arrangements, especially in a globalised job market.\n“If local employees insist on full flexibility for roles that can be equally efficiently performed remotely by workers in lower-cost locations like Manila, they may inadvertently pit themselves against foreign talents who can accept lower salaries.\n“This scenario could potentially disadvantage local applicants, as the cost of employing a similarly qualified individual in Manila may be significantly lower than employing a Singaporean for the same role,” he added.\nThe debate also begs the broader question: In resource-scarce Singapore, is it too much for employees to seek a better quality of life by way of better work-life balance?\nOr must its workforce — as the nation’s prime resource — remain in a perpetual state of being “kiasu” (Singlish for “scared to lose”), for fear of others stealing its rice bowl and Singapore’s labour force ultimately losing its competitive edge?\nRecent surveys have found a growing expectation among the Singapore workforce for greater work-life balance.\nA survey done by recruitment firm Randstad in 2023 found that more respondents are prioritising work-life balance over salary: Ninety-five per cent of Singapore workers said that having work-life balance is important to them in their current and future jobs, compared to 90 per cent who said pay is important.\nHuman resource and sociology experts told TODAY that while the Covid-19 pandemic may have accelerated the demand for better work-life balance and flexible work as more employees recognise the feasibility of such arrangements, the growing expectation for work-life balance is ultimately not a new phenomenon.\nAssociate Professor Tan Ern Ser, a sociologist from National University of Singapore (NUS), said that even before working from home became a feature of the new post-pandemic work norm, there has been a “silent but significant value shift towards prioritising work autonomy and quality of life” — and, in turn, work-life balance — with Singapore becoming a more affluent, post-materialist society.\nDr Shannon Ang, an assistant professor of sociology at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), said that the contradictions of constantly prioritising economic growth over “life” also gradually get brought to the forefront, or become more acute, as societies develop.\nIn the past, he noted, “we were told we needed to work hard, because Singapore’s place in the world should not be taken for granted, and that we could lose it all if we gave it less than our very best”.\nHowever, the slower economic growth Singapore sees today compared to the past could prompt a new generation of workers to feel like it is “less ‘worth it’ to keep pursuing economic growth”, as they do not enjoy the same extent of progress.\n“Older cohorts saw palpable change in their living conditions for the sacrifices that they made. Younger cohorts are unlikely to see the same kind of progress, and are probably quickly realising it may be better to invest their time in pursuits that seem more meaningful to them,” said Dr Ang.\nAt the same time, experts also cautioned against the general tendency to assume that the desire for work-life balance is mainly confined to a younger generation of workers.  \nInstead of couching it as an issue that later-born cohorts are “spoilt and cannot take hard work anymore”, Dr Ang suggested that work-life balance could have become more sought after in recent times due to other factors at play.\nFor example, the growing number of dual-earner couples means that work-life balance may be harder to achieve because there is no longer one person in the family dedicated to doing the household tasks or providing childcare.\nAs an ageing society, Singaporeans are also living longer. At the same time, shrinking family sizes mean care responsibilities are shared among fewer children, and more time may need to be devoted to caregiving or coordinating care for an older parent, said Dr Ang.\nThese societal changes could have also prompted a greater cry for work-life balance over the years.\nAgreeing, Mr Richard Bradshaw, the Asia chief executive officer of recruitment consultancy Ethos BeathChapman, said better work-life balance has grown to be a “common requirement” across different working demographics and ages today, and to some extent, may even be perceived as a form of “basic workers’ rights”.\nThis was something which resonated with 47-year-old father of three Edwin Ho.\nThe senior associate director at Finexis Advisory, who wants to be actively involved in helping his three teenage children to navigate their life stages, said this consideration was among the factors that motivated him to switch from working as an engineer in the Republic of Singapore Air Force to his current career in personal finance. \nBeing in the personal finance industry has allowed him the flexibility to work from home and also plan his own appointments with clients.\n“Ideally we would all like to have work-life balance, but we have different needs at different times. To find balance between work and personal life, we have to constantly make the necessary adjustments to make it happen,” Mr Ho said.\nLikewise, Ms Samantha Ong, 36, told TODAY that her approach towards work is to work harder while she is young, so she would be able to retire earlier.\n“When I had children, I shifted my priorities. I need to work hard for my family — providing financial security yet at the same time spending quality time with the children when they are young,” said Ms Ong.\nThe marketing campaign manager at technology firm Telstra International has two young children aged two and four years old.\n“It requires a delicate balance, smart planning and often a good support system,” she added.\n“You have to accept that there is no ‘perfect’ work-life balance — it’s more important to strive for a realistic schedule instead of a perfect one. Some days, I might focus more on work, while on other days I spend more time and energy on hobbies like working out or being with loved ones.”\nWith more people yearning for better work-life balance, the million-dollar question is whether, from employers’ point of view, it is too much to ask for.\nWhile they understand the desire for better work-life balance and integration, some employers, especially those in the services industries, told TODAY that it is difficult to accede to employees’ requests, given the nature of their role and industry.\nGenerational gaps may also play a part in influencing the success of flexible work arrangements.\nMr Jianhan Qiu, principal for strategy and change in Asia at strategy, design, and construction firm Unispace Singapore, said that younger Gen Zers may be more accustomed to operating virtually compared to their older colleagues. \n“This generational gap influences managerial approaches to hybrid meetings and mentorship which might contradict flexible work arrangements. Managers who favour face-to-face interactions may inadvertently pressure remote employees to be in the office more to avoid missing out on career development opportunities.”\nAdditionally, some roles and industries may be better suited to flexible work that could afford its employees better work-life balance, simply due to their nature of work.\nMr Kenji Naito, group chief executive officer at recruitment agency Reeracoen, said that sectors such as technology, or creative and professional services, tend to demonstrate greater openness to flexible work.\nConversely, industries with stringent operational requirements or client-facing roles may find it more challenging to implement such arrangements, he said.\nMr Salim Radiman, a business development manager and assistant general manager at a cleaning services company, said: “It is quite difficult for us to have that flexible work environment, because...we have to provide manpower to ensure that daily operations are being deployed according to the (client’s) contract.”\nHe added that Singaporeans tend to shun work in the cleaning as well as food industries because of its long hours and the need to work on public holidays and weekends.\n“That’s why in my kind of industry, we have to hire Chinese workers, Malaysian workers, Myanmar workers, and Filipino workers. For them, they come to Singapore and their mindset is to work and earn a living for their family, so their commitment is different from the locals.”\nAsked about these concerns of employers who may rethink hiring local staff and instead look overseas for recruitment, particularly given the difference in costs, Minister of State for Manpower Gan Siow Huang said last month that the competitiveness of Singapore’s workforce was key.\nLocal workers must have in-demand skills and be able to meet business productivity needs. They must also remain competitive in their work ethic or “the softer things, like being reliable, trusted”, which are attributes of the local workforce that businesses appreciate, she said.\nSpeaking in Parliament earlier this month, she also reiterated that remote work and outsourcing are already global trends regardless of Singapore’s guidelines.\n“Even if foreigners are not working in Singapore... they will still be competing with us when working in companies overseas.”\nInstead, it was more important for local workers to continually upskill and stay productive to compete for jobs not just in Singapore, but globally, she added.\nDoes this mean, however, that Singapore workers need to work hard over long hours to retain their competitive edge?\nNot so, said the experts interviewed, who pointed out that competitiveness is multi-faceted, and prioritising work-life balance does not have to come at the expense of a workforce’s attractiveness or economic progress.\nIn 2022, the BBC reported that Norway and Denmark had work weeks that were shorter than 40 hours, yet were respectively the second- and seventh-most productive countries in the world then.\nFor one thing, what workers may lose out on in absolute hours put into work can be made up for in other ways, such as increased productivity during the actual time they are at their jobs.\nAssociate Professor Nicholas Sim, from the Singapore University of Social Sciences’ (SUSS) School of Business, said: “While there are trade-offs between competitiveness and work-life balance, it is not necessarily true that work-life balance must be sacrificed to increase competitiveness, particularly if this refers to an increase in productivity.”\nHe added that the assumption that one must work longer hours to be more competitive is often “unfounded”.\nHighlighting findings from studies which surveyed respondents of various occupations and skill levels, Assoc Prof Sim said that working beyond a certain threshold of hours may in fact increase errors and decrease one’s productivity.\n“Moreover, many studies have also consistently shown that poorer employee well-being is associated with increased disengagement and intentions to quit.\n“A hyper-competitive corporate culture may also foster toxic work environments that ultimately undermines productivity.”\nAgreeing, Dr Kelvin Seah, an economist at NUS, said that what is more important is to assess not only the quantity, but also the quality of time spent at work.\nTo this end, having greater work-life balance may actually improve one’s output.\n“If employees feel happier and less stressed at work, they may be able to think of better ideas, be more efficient and engaged at work, and perform better at their jobs,” he added.\nAgreeing, Ms Cassandra Loh, vice-president of partnerships and solutions at mental health start-up Intellect, said she believes companies should instead be more “results-oriented”.\nShe also does not believe that having work-life balance is necessarily in conflict with also working hard.\n“I always believe that if one has ownership and takes pride in their work, whatever the work might be, work will still get done (within) deadlines.”\nWork-life balance or flexibility just helps the worker schedule their day better, she added. \nFor Ms Loh, who is a mother to two young children aged one-and-a-half and five years old, this could look like trying to be home by 7pm to spend time with her kids, before returning to focus on her work at 10pm after they go to sleep.\nOther employees TODAY spoke to also disagree with the notion that those who yearn for work-life balance are less hungry for success.\nMr Ho from Finexis Advisory said that a person who devotes equal amounts of time to work and personal life can be more successful, productive and fulfilling, than a person who only works hard and spends huge amounts of time at work while sacrificing other matters in life, like spending time with family and friends or travelling.\n“To me, working hard and being successful does not mean simply attaining some professional or work-related goals. It means putting in quality effort to learn from experiences every day...and using less time to achieve one’s targets and goals.\n“I think we first must define (our) purpose for working hard and what success is, so that we can work towards that goal and in doing so, learn to find a balance between work and personal life.”\nAgreeing, Mr Jivan Tulsiani, the head of marketing at blockchain firm TZ APAC, said that a growing demand for work-life balance does not reflect a lack of hunger from employees.\n“It's more of a shift in how ambitious professionals define success. It's important to understand the concept of purpose, which is an aggregate of components such as talent, passion, skills, occupation, charity and service,” he said.\n“Professionals are able to satisfy some of these components in their jobs, but are also willing to make time for other priorities outside of work to fulfil their purposes.”\nMr Tulsiani has observed that newer generations of workers are “very intentional about their passions”.\nSome employers who recognise the need to afford their employees greater work-life harmony say that they have such employees who are high achievers.\nMr Winthrop Wong, co-founder and pharmacist at e-pharmacy Glovida-Rx, said this is the case of some of its medical sales staff. \n“We set them qualitative and quantitative goals on a yearly and monthly basis and if they are able to achieve these targets, we basically allow them to schedule their days in what is most productive to them.”\nExperts interviewed by TODAY also pointed out that offering greater work-life balance and flexible work arrangements could even attract additional groups of workers — who are otherwise unable to contribute to the workforce if they had to adhere strictly to traditional work settings and hours — into the market.\nDr Ang from NTU said: “We tend to focus on the people who are currently working, and act as if they are trying to skive off by asking for more work-life balance.\n“What we probably miss, are the people for whom a better work-life balance will allow (them) to work, for those whom it will allow to work longer or more sustainably (such as older persons, or those with health conditions), and so on.\n“Much depends on whether employers are creative enough to tap such people by adapting their own processes or (possibly outmoded) ways of thinking.”\nAmid a push for better work-life balance and flexible work arrangements even as Singapore strives to maintain its competitive edge, both employers and employees will have their work cut out for them in navigating this new landscape.\nFor a prospective employee, expressing a desire for greater work-life balance by way of flexible work arrangements — especially at the job interview stage — may work against the candidate, if the employer does not have such work arrangements in place, said Mr Suhaimi of SSA Group.\nAt the same time, employers who do not offer such flexible work arrangements may also find themselves at a disadvantage in attracting and retaining talent, especially as workers’ expectations for work-life balance continue to evolve, he said.\nThis is also a point that Manpower Minister Tan See Leng has made in explaining the rationale of flexible work arrangements. \nWith corporate information on pay, benefits, and culture becoming more transparent and widely available across prospective employers and employees, Mr Qiu from Unispace Singapore said that companies will need to adapt to attract and retain talent.\nOver time, this would leave the organisations’ approach towards work-life balance and flexible work to be the main differentiator.\nWhile employers interviewed by TODAY acknowledged the benefits greater work-life balance had on employee engagement, talent attraction and retention, they also raised concerns.\nOne challenge flagged by several employers includes the difficulty of monitoring employees’ productivity and performance when they work remotely or are operating on flexible schedules.\nOther concerns include potential impacts on business operations and stakeholder relationships, ensuring fair team workload distribution, and any associated costs, said Ms Khew Shu Ping, deputy managing director of public relations agency Tate Anzur.\nAsked what an optimal balance to strike between work-life balance and an economy’s performance could look like in Singapore’s context, Dr Ang from NTU said this balance would differ for each person at each stage of life.\n“This means we will need to create room for people to strike these different balances without feeling like they cannot survive.”\nTo do this necessitates a mindset shift from being a “market society” — driven by economic logic on who is worthy of respect and what is worth striving for — to that of a “market economy”, where the economy is simply a tool for exchange and society decides what it values and how to thus make the market work for it, said Dr Ang.\nUltimately, the transition towards fully embracing greater work-life balance — premised on a mindset of results-oriented work — will require cultural and mindset shifts, which would take time, said experts.\nCiting studies on how culture tends to be highly persistent, Assoc Prof Sim from SUSS said that it is very unlikely for there to be an organic shift towards a culture of measuring performance by output, unless there are some external macroeconomic or policy shocks, similar to Covid-19.\nNotwithstanding that, employers told TODAY that building a culture of mutual trust and open communication with their employees would be key to a smooth transition and moving the needle.\nFor one thing, employees are encouraged to clearly define their needs and the specific type of flexible work arrangement they’re seeking, said Ms Khew from Tate Anzur.\n“As part of their application, they can submit a well-defined plan outlining how their flexible work arrangement will be implemented,” she added.\nThis plan should address how their workload will be covered during their absence, how they will stay connected and maintain proactive communication, and their commitment to continually deliver high-quality work.\nThese go a long way in showing that employees can manage the responsibility of flexi-work arrangements, said Mr Danny Tan, managing director of public relations agency Grayling Singapore.\nOther ways this is evident are in areas such as employees’ timeliness — as seen from their punctuality for work and in keeping to deadlines — and their overall performance at work.\n“If they have performance issues, it is unlikely that they will be considered for flexi-work arrangements,” said Mr Tan.\nThe agency currently operates on a 4.5-day work week that is extended to all employees who have spent more than a year with the firm.\nAgreeing, Mr Wong from Glovida-Rx said employers will be more likely to accede to requests for better work-life balance or flexi-work arrangements from workers with a good track record.\n“We build a culture of trust over a period of time.”\nBeyond building trust between employers and employees, Mr Wong said it is important to also foster a good working culture among employees themselves.\nOffering select employees flexi-work options and better work-life balance takes “great communication” from the employer — in that the company’s management must be clear on the parameters not only with the employees involved, but also with their team about why the arrangements are in place.\nCommunicating clearly, and being open to questions, will thus help prevent any feelings of resentment between team members or concerns that there is some bias in an organisation, he added.\nStill, these are all worthy adjustments to be made as employers and employees alike navigate what could be the next new normal.\nMr Tulsiani of TZ APAC said: “The lines between work and personal life are not as clear as it was before: Professionals today view their occupation as an important piece of a jigsaw puzzle that embodies their purpose in life. \n“It is one of the many priorities they devote their attention to, in addition to family, health, passion, service, charity, talent development and more.\n“Putting their employees’ purposes at the forefront of policy making will (thus) be key to retaining and attracting the best people, which is the lifeblood of any organisation.”"

            "Article Summary": "An increasing number of Singaporeans are exploring property options in Johor, motivated by lower costs and lifestyle benefits .\nWhile the current strong demand may be attributed to the relaunch of the RTS Link project and the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) announcement, property experts said it is primarily due to housing costs and inflation in Singapore.\nBuyers are snapping up units in Johor Bahru and Iskandar Puteri for various uses, such as a second home, as an investment or to live in.\nHowever, caution is advised, as experiences vary. Some who bought properties in Iskandar Malaysia during the hype 10 years ago have faced losses due to political shifts and oversupply.\nUltimately, prospective buyers are urged to adopt a local mindset rather than that of a Singaporean, and to wait for concrete progress on infrastructure projects before committing to a purchase",
            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — Lots of sharply contrasting stories swirl around the topic of Johor property.\nThere are those like 27-year-old Kylie Hung, who moved into a three-bedroom condominium in Johor Bahru seven months ago and is enjoying access to features such as a pool, butler service and a private beach. \nShe currently pays about RM3,500 (S$1,000) a month for the mortgage and maintenance fees on her Country Garden Danga Bay condominium, and is happy with her purchase. \nBut then there are those with regrets, such as Mr Eric Sim, who bought two four-bedroom units of 2,400 sq ft each near JB Sentral in 2014 as investments.\nProspects might have looked good then, driven by economic development and mega infrastructure projects such as the Kuala Lumpur–Singapore high-speed rail (HSR), but things subsequently went downhill. \nThe onslaught of new projects raised supply above demand, the 2018 Malaysian general election culminated in a change in government and policies, such as the cancellation of the HSR project and the ringgit continued to weaken against the Singapore dollar. \nMr Sim finally sold both units this year, incurring a loss of RM500,000. \n“It was the worst investment of my life,” he said. \nIn addition to such anecdotes is a constant flow of news, both good and bad, about infrastructure and business developments in Johor. What is a prospective Singaporean buyer meant to make of it all? TODAY takes a closer look.\nIskandar Malaysia comprises the Johor Bahru District, Kulai District and part of the Pontian District. Officially launched in 2006, it encompasses an area of 2,217 sq km, nearly three times the size of Singapore. \nSome of the major cities in Iskandar include Johor Bahru city centre, Iskandar Puteri (where Legoland is) and Pasir Gudang, one of the largest industrial areas in Malaysia. \nThe launch of Iskandar was aimed at attracting international investments that would drive economic growth for the state.\nUntil recently, the piece de resistance of Iskandar was supposed to be Forest City, a colossal luxury real estate project on four man-made islands in the Johor Strait, overlooking the Singapore border. \nLaunched in 2013, Forest City was envisioned as a futuristic, green, and smart city. It is Chinese developer Country Garden's largest overseas project, and was planned to house 700,000 people by 2035.\nDespite its ambitious vision, the project encountered several challenges and controversies due to a mix of low sales, Chinese restrictions on capital outflows, border closures during the pandemic and public backlash against China's increasing influence in Malaysia.\nIn December 2023, CNA reported that only 15 per cent of the entire project had been completed. \nNotwithstanding the several stumbling blocks over the years, interest in Johor homes remains high among Singaporeans.\nIn January, for example, there was some hype over properties near Bukit Chagar — where the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) Link station is located — after a commemorative ceremony attended by then-Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. \nBut real estate experts told TODAY that rising inflation and property prices at home are the more important reasons driving Singaporean homebuyers up north.\nSix property agents TODAY spoke to said that while a significant number of Singaporeans are looking to buy Johor homes for investment, there are also those looking to live there or have a second home.\nExperiences vary widely among those who have taken the plunge, which has made it difficult for some to decipher whether Johor property is a good investment.\nOperations director Victor Lee, 53, and his wife Crystal Wang, 38, are among those with no regrets. When TODAY met the couple on May 15, they had just collected the keys to their two-bedroom unit at R&F Princess Cove, which they now call home.\nMr Lee said there have been promising improvements with regard to traffic on the Causeway, with both governments constantly making efforts to smoothen the travel process, such as the recent implementation of electronic gates. \nBut some who entered the Johor property market 10 years ago did not see their investments bear fruit. \nA supply chain manager who wished to be known only as Mr Lee invested in a property in 2014: An RM1.7 million double-story cluster house in Horizon Hills.\n“I expected to be able to sell my house within five years and make a profit due to capital appreciation,” said the 40-year-old. \nHowever, things did not go as planned. In his view, the launch of Forest City “killed the property market”. \n“There’s an oversupply of units because of the project. We did not expect the developers from China to come in that fast. If I were to sell now, I would be looking at a loss,” said Mr Lee. \nAll things considered, is investing in a property in Johor a worthwhile investment? Property experts and homeowners advise prospective buyers to do their homework thoroughly before making a decision. \nMr Sim, the former investment banker, said one should refrain from following investment trends without research.\n“If I could turn back time, I would do a little more research on the economic activities in the area. I would also check the housing supply – not the number of units available at that point in time, but the amount of land and whether property developers would build more.\n“If I had done my homework back in 2014, I would've found information that other developers had plans to go big,” he said, referring to Forest City. \nMr Faizul of Far Capital stressed the importance of looking at a property in Malaysia through the lens of a local, instead of a Singaporean.\n“When you use a Singaporean mindset to buy a property in Johor, it's suicidal,” he said, since the buyer may end up overpaying for their purchase. \nWhen investing based on the potential of future infrastructure and amenities, Mr Faizul also advised prospective buyers to be patient and only make the move when there is concrete movement for the projects.  \n“Like the RTS, when you see movements from both governments, then you know for sure it won’t be cancelled. (Wait until things are) built first, instead of investing during the talking stage.\""

            "Article Body": "Each week, TODAY’s long-running Big Read series delves into the trends and issues that matter. This week, we look at how Singapore workers can navigate their growing priority on work-life balance without losing their competitive edge. This is a shortened version of the full feature, which can be found here.\nSINGAPORE — For new mother Nur Sabrina Muhleseddin, being able to enjoy work-life balance is something she values in a job, as it allows her to be present for her son’s milestones.\nThe 29-year-old digital marketing manager said her priorities have shifted since she gave birth in July last year. She was working in a different company previously, but had sought out a new role four months after becoming a mother. \nBeing able to balance work with caring for her son is especially important to Ms Nur Sabrina, whose husband works in the hospitality industry as a shift manager — often having to work irregular hours and on weekends.\nHer flexible work post-pregnancy would mean that at least one of them — herself or her husband — can be present for their child, she said.\nCurrently, she works almost entirely from home — save for a few in-person meetings with her clients at their offices about once or twice a week.\n“I think presently, nothing is more important than to be able to witness my son growing up and being around for his milestones.\n“I’ve had a good few years of working up the ladder. Right now, I just need a job so that I can provide food on the table and share the bills with my husband,” said Ms Nur Sabrina.\nThe approach embraced by Ms Nur Sabrina reflects a growing shift among Singapore workers towards prioritising work-life balance — with many recognising that work is not everything, and hence desiring to spend less time at work and more time on personal pursuits.\nRecent surveys have shown a growing expectation among the Singapore workforce for greater work-life harmony.\nA survey done by recruitment agency Randstad in 2023 found that more respondents are prioritising work-life balance over salary: Ninety-five per cent of Singapore workers said that having work-life balance is important to them in their current and future jobs, compared to 90 per cent who said pay is important.\nRelated to the greater yearning for work-life balance is flexible work options, which allow employees to carve out a suitable work-life rhythm tailored to their individual needs at different life stages.\nFrom December this year, all firms in Singapore will be required to have a formal process in place for their employees to request for flexible working arrangements.\nHowever, the release of the guidelines last month has also reignited debate on the issue of work-life balance and flexible work, which has long attracted polarising sentiments — even to the extent of some questioning whether Singapore workers have increasingly lost their hunger and drive.\nIn the wake of the announcement, some employers had also come out to say that they may even rethink hiring local staff, and instead look overseas for recruitment.\nThe debate also begs the broader question: In resource-scarce Singapore, is it too much for employees to seek a better quality of life by way of better work-life balance?\nOr must its workforce — as the nation’s prime resource — remain in a perpetual state of being “kiasu” (Singlish for “scared to lose”), for fear of others stealing its rice bowl and ultimately losing its overall competitive edge?\nHuman resource and sociology experts told TODAY that while the Covid-19 pandemic may have accelerated the demand for better work-life balance and flexible work as more employees recognise the feasibility of such arrangements, the growing expectation for work-life balance is ultimately not a new phenomenon.\nAssociate Professor Tan Ern Ser, a sociologist from National University of Singapore (NUS), said that even before working from home became a feature of the new post-pandemic work norm, there has been a “silent but significant value shift towards prioritising work autonomy and quality of life” — and, in turn, work-life balance — with Singapore becoming a more affluent, post-materialist society.\nDr Shannon Ang, an assistant professor of sociology at Nanyang Technological University, said that the slower economic growth Singapore sees today compared to the past could prompt a new generation of workers to feel like it is “less ‘worth it’ to keep pursuing economic growth”, as they do not enjoy the same extent of progress.\n“Older cohorts saw palpable change in their living conditions for the sacrifices that they made. Younger cohorts are unlikely to see the same kind of progress, and are probably quickly realising it may be better to invest their time in pursuits that seem more meaningful to them,” said Dr Ang.\nAt the same time, experts also cautioned against the general tendency to assume that the desire for work-life balance is mainly confined to a younger generation of workers.  \nMr Richard Bradshaw, the Asia chief executive officer of recruitment consultancy Ethos BeathChapman, noted that the desire for better work-life balance has grown to be a “common requirement” across different working demographics and ages today, and to some extent, may even be perceived as a form of “basic workers’ rights”.\nEmployees also disagree with the notion that those who yearn for work-life balance are less hungry for success.\nFather of three Edwin Ho, 47, said that a person who devotes equal amounts of time to work and personal life can be more successful, productive and fulfilling, than a person who only works hard and spends huge amounts of time at work while sacrificing other matters in life, like spending time with family and friends or travelling.\n“I think we first must define (our) purpose for working hard and what success is, so that we can work towards that goal and in doing so, learn to find a balance between work and personal life.”\nThe senior associate director at Finexis Advisory made the switch from an engineer in the Republic of Singapore Air Force to his current career in personal finance to be able to spend more time with his children, who are aged 19, 16, and 14 years old.\nMr Jivan Tulsiani, head of marketing at blockchain firm TZ APAC, also agreed that a growing demand for work-life balance does not reflect a lack of hunger from employees.\n“It’s more of a shift in how ambitious professionals define success. It’s important to understand the concept of purpose, which is an aggregate of components such as talent, passion, skills, occupation, charity and service,” he said.\nWith more people yearning for better work-life harmony, the million-dollar question is whether, from employers’ point of view, it is too much to ask for.\nSome employers, especially those in the services industries, told TODAY that it is difficult to accede to employees’ requests, given the nature of their role and industry.\nOther challenges they raised include the difficulty of monitoring employees’ productivity and performance when they work remotely or are operating on flexible schedules.\nAlso of concern to employers are potential impacts on business operations and stakeholder relationships, ensuring fair team workload distribution, and any associated costs, said Ms Khew Shu Ping, deputy managing director of public relations agency Tate Anzur.\nSome employers who recognise the need to afford their employees greater work-life harmony said that they also have such employees who are high achievers.\nMr Winthrop Wong, co-founder and pharmacist at e-pharmacy Glovida-Rx, said this is the case of some of its medical sales staff. \n“We set them qualitative and quantitative goals on a yearly and monthly basis and if they are able to achieve these targets, we basically allow them to schedule their days in what is most productive to them.”\nUltimately, there is no need for Singapore workers to remain in a perpetually “kiasu” state — more “work”, less “life” — to ensure they retain their competitive edge, said experts.\nThey pointed out that competitiveness is multi-faceted, and prioritising work-life balance does not have to come at the expense of a workforce’s attractiveness or economic progress.\nIn 2022, the BBC reported that Norway and Denmark had work weeks that were shorter than 40 hours, yet were respectively the second- and seventh-most productive countries in the world then.\nFor one thing, what workers may lose out on in absolute hours put into work can be made up for in other ways, such as increased productivity during the actual time they are at their jobs.\nAssociate Professor Nicholas Sim, from the Singapore University of Social Sciences’ School of Business, said: “While there are trade-offs between competitiveness and work-life balance, it is not necessarily true that work-life balance must be sacrificed to increase competitiveness, particularly if this refers to an increase in productivity.”\nHighlighting findings from studies which surveyed respondents of various occupations and skill levels, Assoc Prof Sim said that working beyond a certain threshold of hours may in fact increase errors and decrease one’s productivity.\n“Moreover, many studies have also consistently shown that poorer employee well-being is associated with increased disengagement and intentions to quit,\" he said,\n“A hyper-competitive corporate culture may also foster toxic work environments that ultimately undermines productivity.”\nAs the push for flexible work arrangements gains momentum even as Singapore strives to maintain its competitive edge, both employers and employees will have their work cut out for them in navigating this new landscape.\nFor a prospective employee, expressing a desire for greater work-life balance by way of flexible work arrangements — especially at the job interview stage — may work against the candidate, if the employer does not have such work arrangements in place, said Mr Suhaimi Salleh, chief executive officer of consultancy and professional training firm SSA Group.\nAt the same time, employers who do not offer such flexible work arrangements may also find themselves at a disadvantage in attracting and retaining talent, especially as workers’ expectations for work-life balance continue to evolve, he said.\nThis is also a point that Manpower Minister Tan See Leng has made in explaining the rationale of flexible work arrangements. \nUltimately, the transition towards fully embracing greater work-life balance — premised on a mindset of results-oriented work — will require cultural and mindset shifts, which would take time, said experts.\nLeading up to that, employers told TODAY that building a culture of mutual trust and open communication with their employees would be key to a smooth transition.\nStill, all these are worthy adjustments to be made.\nMr Tulsiani of TZ APAC, said: “The lines between work and personal life are not as clear as it was before: Professionals today view their occupation as an important piece of a jigsaw puzzle that embodies their purpose in life. \n“It is one of the many priorities they devote their attention to, in addition to family, health, passion, service, charity, talent development and more.\n“Putting their employees’ purposes at the forefront of policy making will (thus) be key to retaining and attracting the best people, which is the lifeblood of any organisation.”"

            "Article Body": "Each week, TODAY’s long-running Big Read series delves into the trends and issues that matter. This week, we look at whether progress has been made in Singapore's push to reduce use of single-use plastics and disposables. This is a shortened version of the full feature, which can be found here.\nSINGAPORE — Before she leaves home, Ms Cha Yoo Kyung, 27, always makes sure she has three essential items with her: A food container, cutlery and a reusable shopping bag.\nShe uses them to pack her lunch every day from coffee shops and hawker centres near her office, as part of a conscious effort to cut down on single-use plastic waste. \n“I’ve cultivated this habit for about five years now, and it’s mainly thanks to my mum. She takes active steps to minimise unnecessary use of plastic, and she’s been carrying an eco bag to get groceries for as long as I can remember,” said the Singapore permanent resident, who works as a writer.\nAsked if it was difficult to change her behaviour or to maintain it, Ms Cha said no.\n“It’s like trying to drink more water throughout the day. You just have to remind yourself and translate that thought into action constantly,” she said. \nMs Cha is part of a growing minority of people here who strive to do more for the environment by reducing the use of single-use disposables and plastics in their everyday lives. \nHawker centres, as ubiquitous as they are here, have also taken baby steps to become greener. \nWhen Bukit Canberra Hawker Centre opened in December 2022, it made the news for its aim to be one of the greenest hawker centres in Singapore.\nAmong other things, its 44 stalls do not use disposable cutlery for dining in. For takeaways, they use only biodegradable containers or paper bags and boxes, instead of plastic ones.\nStill, some diners quickly complained about having to fork out 80 cents for biodegradable containers, underlying the challenge of getting more Singaporeans to embrace sustainability. \nThat reportedly prompted the operator to then stipulate that stall owners are to charge no more than 30 cents for these containers. This practice is still in place, hawkers there told TODAY this week. \nHowever, this also means that some hawkers have to subsidise the cost of the containers, as they said their actual cost is at least S$0.50 per container. \nSimilar consumer complaints surfaced earlier this month — over homegrown bakery brand BreadTalk’s implementation of a S$0.10 charge per disposable plastic carrier bag as well as a S$0.50 charge for a woven carrier bag by American footwear store Skechers.\nWhile some consumers support such moves to cut waste, others question if these practices are actually “greenwashing” and aimed at helping retailers increase their profits.\nPlastic is the fourth highest type of waste generated in Singapore, with one million tonnes of plastic waste generated in 2022, according to the National Environment Agency (NEA). \nThis translates to 177kg of plastic waste per capita in 2022, a 17 per cent increase from the 145kg per capita in 2017. \nOnly 6 per cent of plastic waste is recycled. The remaining 944,000 tonnes, comprising single-use and reusable plastics, are disposed of. \nNEA’s website also states that in 2020, about 200,000 tonnes of domestic waste were single-use disposables, comprising both packaging and non-packaging items such as carrier bags, food and beverage containers, as well as tableware and utensils.\nIt also stated that, based on the current rate of waste generation, Singapore’s only landfill, Semakau Landfill, is projected to be fully filled by 2035, so reducing the use of single-use disposable items will help reduce waste generation.\nIn recent years, both the authorities and environmental groups have launched various initiatives to nudge people to cut down on single-use plastics and disposables.\nThese initiatives include:  \nThe various moves have moved the needle in changing consumer behaviour in some aspects.\nIn January this year, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu said the number of plastic bags used at large supermarkets had dropped by 50 to 80 per cent since the mandatory minimum charge of five cents kicked in. \nFor a retiree who wanted to be known only as Mrs Nathan, the shift towards eco-living started three years ago. \nCarrying a reusable bag at a FairPrice supermarket, the 65-year-old told TODAY that her children persuaded her to stop using plastic bags to “save the animals”. She would also bring tiffin carriers when the family eats out in case there is unfinished food. \nHowever, hawkers and other retailers told TODAY they have seen little change in consumer behaviour, as they have not observed any significant increase in customers bringing their own containers. \nThose working at several bubble tea stalls, including Chi Cha San Chen, LiHo, and The Alley, said while they welcome customers who bring their own cups, they normally see such individuals fewer than five times a week. \nThe situation is also similar at food outlets such as Old Chang Kee, Dough Culture, and Jian Bo Shui Kueh, as well as bakeries nestled in public housing blocks. \n“Most people in Singapore, both consumers and businesses, are driven by dollars and cents — what is the cheapest and most convenient — and rarely by altruistic reasons,” said Ms Lin Qinghui, founder of social enterprise D2L.sg, a one-stop food surplus and waste manager.\n“The culture here is to throw things away. It’s all about convenience, and it’s hard to change this because it’s ingrained in Singaporean society.” \nMr Rayson Lim, 27, who is unemployed, said he did try to pick up the habit of bringing his own container out for four to five months in 2022. Eventually, he stopped because he gave in to his laziness in washing the container after eating each time. \nCivil servant Shafiq Ahmad, 29, echoed Mr Lim’s sentiments. “I haven’t tried bringing my own container before, but just the thought of doing the washing after eating makes me feel it’s tiring and troublesome.” \nAmidst the push to use less disposable plastic in everyday life, some companies have jumped on the bandwagon through moves such as charging for plastic bags and switching from conventional plastic bags or packaging to those using biodegradable plastic or paper and other non-plastic materials. \nHowever, there has also been debate on whether some of these practices constitute greenwashing. \nFor example, consumers have taken to forums to talk about how a certain health and beauty retailer has started charging for plastic bags but still uses plenty of plastic for its in-house water products. \nAnother discussion involved a food court that removed plastic straws but introduced cups with plastic caps for cold drinks, which sell for at least S$2. \nA consumer pointed out that cold drinks cost about S$1.40 a cup before the change. \nSome questioned whether the amount of plastic used for the cap is less than that of a straw, and whether this is just a gimmick to increase profit. \nOthers asked if paper or cloth alternatives for disposable plastics used by some retailers are actually more environmentally friendly.  \nMs Lin, the environmentalist, cautioned against advocating for non-plastic alternatives without considering Singapore’s “unique” waste management system, where all trash goes to the incinerator.\nHence, she said plastics are efficiently incinerated, potentially reducing their harmful effects compared with countries relying on landfills.\nConversely, some other materials used to replace plastic come at a higher environmental cost as they might not burn as efficiently or as cleanly as plastic. \n“Plastic is not environmentally friendly, but if you look at the life cycle analysis across these materials, it’s the lesser evil because the alternatives, like woven cloth, fabric, cardboard, and paper, could actually bring more harm by leaving a larger carbon footprint,\" said Ms Lin.\nA life cycle assessment is a comprehensive method used to evaluate the environmental impacts of a product or service throughout its entire life cycle.\nIt considers various environmental factors, such as energy consumption, resource depletion, emissions to air, water, and soil, and waste generation at each stage of the product's life.\nOn NEA's website, in explaining why Singapore does not ban single-use plastics, the agency said that doing so may lead to a switch to disposables made from other materials such as paper or degradable plastics, “which also create waste, have their own set of environmental impacts and are not necessarily better for the environment”. \n“In view of the above, instead of advocating a switch to degradable materials, Singapore’s approach is to reduce the use of disposables regardless of material type, and promote the use of reusables.”\nSimilarly, Mr Yasser Amin, who heads Stridy, a non-profit organisation addressing urban waste management issues worldwide, said terms such as “biodegradable” or “compostable” often confuse the average person. \n“It's like a marketing tactic,” said Mr Yasser. He cited how some coffee and cafe chains switched from plastic to compostable straws, when these may not be the more environmentally friendly option.\n“Companies should be more aware and capable of conducting life cycle assessments to determine the true environmental impact of their alternatives. People need to question company claims more thoroughly.” \nIn response to TODAY’s queries on legislation or guidelines to tackle greenwashing, a spokesperson for the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore said that it is currently developing a guide to provide greater clarity to businesses on sustainability claims. \nIt will share more details in due course, the spokesperson added."

            "Article Summary": "To reduce waste and promote sustainability, Singapore has in recent years made a push towards using less single-use disposables, particularly those made from plastic.\nThese measures, such as a compulsory charge for plastic bags at large supermarkets, have led to positive change in some consumer behaviour.\nBut by and large, public attitudes towards using less single-use disposables have not changed much, say businesses, environmentalists and consumers.\nConvenience and laziness are often cited as barriers to adopting sustainable practices such as bringing reusable containers and bags.\nAt the same time, consumers and environmental groups are concerned about greenwashing, asking if some businesses are seeking to profit from moves marketed as being green.\nThe BYO (Bring-Your-Own) Singapore movement started by non-profit organisation Zero Waste SG in 2017, which saw over 430 retail outlets offering incentives to customers who bring their own reusable bags, bottles or containers.\nThe phasing out of the use of plastic straws by over 270 food and beverage outlets in a 2019 drive by the World Wide Fund for Nature .\nThe Say YES to Waste Less annual campaign launched in 2019 by NEA in partnership with businesses to encourage consumers to reduce the use of disposables.\nFrom 2021, major producers of packaged products were required to collect data on the packaging they supply to the market so they can better manage or reduce their use of disposable packaging.\nA minimum five-cent charge mandated by the Government for every disposable plastic bag in major supermarkets, starting from July 2023 ",
            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — Before she leaves home, Ms Cha Yoo Kyung, 27, always makes sure she has three essential items with her: A food container, cutlery and a reusable shopping bag.\nShe uses them to pack her lunch every day from coffee shops and hawker centres near her office, as part of a conscious effort to cut down on single-use  plastic waste. \n“I’ve cultivated this habit for about five years now, and it’s mainly thanks to my mum. She takes active steps to minimise unnecessary use of plastic, and she’s been carrying an eco bag to get groceries for as long as I can remember,” said the Singapore permanent resident, who works as a writer.\nAsked if it was difficult to change her behaviour or to maintain it, Ms Cha said no. \n“It’s like trying to drink more water throughout the day. You just have to remind yourself and translate that thought into action constantly,” she said. \n“And if you forget easily, leave your container and utensils in the office instead of taking them home. Set a reminder to bring your container out during lunch, or have a colleague who asks you, ‘Eh, where’s your container?’ This helps a lot.” \nMs Cha is part of a growing minority of people here who strive to do more for the environment by reducing the use of plastics and single-use disposables in their everyday lives. \nHawker centres, as ubiquitous as they are here, have also taken baby steps to become greener. \nWhen Bukit Canberra Hawker Centre opened in December 2022, it made the news for its aim to be one of the greenest hawker centres in Singapore.\nAmong other things, its 44 stalls do not use disposable cutlery for dining in. For takeaways, they use only biodegradable containers or paper bags and boxes, instead of plastic ones.\nStill, some diners quickly complained about having to fork out S$0.80 for biodegradable containers, underlying the challenge of getting more Singaporeans to embrace sustainability. \nThat reportedly prompted the operator to then stipulate that stall owners are to charge no more than S$0.30 for these containers. This practice is still in place, hawkers there told TODAY this week.\nHowever, this also means that some hawkers have to subsidise the cost of the containers, as they said their actual cost is at least S$0.50 per container. \nSimilar consumer complaints surfaced earlier this month — over homegrown bakery brand BreadTalk’s implementation of a S$0.10 charge per disposable plastic carrier bag as well as a S$0.50 charge for a woven carrier bag by American footwear store Skechers.\nWhile some consumers support such moves to cut waste, others question if these practices are actually “greenwashing” and aimed at helping retailers increase their profits.\nGreenwashing is when a business misleads consumers that their products or practices have greater environmental benefits than is the case.\nMeanwhile, businesses — from bubble tea shops to hawkers, bakeries and mini marts — as well as environmental advocacy groups and consumers themselves also tell TODAY that green habits such as those adopted by Ms Cha are still the exception rather than the norm.\nConvenience is an often cited reason, with consumers saying it is too “troublesome” to bring their own bags or containers.\nAs Singapore takes baby steps towards cutting down single-use disposables and plastic waste, TODAY takes a deeper look at how Singapore has fared, why public attitudes have largely not changed and what more can be done to nudge more consumers to go green. \nPlastic is the fourth highest type of waste generated in Singapore, with one million tonnes of plastic waste generated in 2022, according to the National Environment Agency (NEA). \nThis translates to 177kg of plastic waste per capita in 2022, a 17 per cent increase from the 145kg per capita in 2017. \nOnly 6 per cent of plastic waste is recycled. The remaining 944,000 tonnes, comprising single-use and reusable plastics, are disposed of. \nNEA’s website also states that in 2020, about 200,000 tonnes of domestic waste were single-use disposables, comprising both packaging and non-packaging items such as carrier bags, food and beverage containers, as well as tableware and utensils.\nSingapore is also one of the world’s greatest consumers of single-use plastics, with a per capita use of 76kg in 2019, according to global data gathering platform Statista. This was also the biggest volume in the Asia-Pacific region. \nNEA said on its website that with Singapore’s only landfill, Semakau Landfill, projected to be fully filled by 2035 based on current rate of waste generation, reducing the use of single-use disposable items will help cut waste generation.\nIn recent years, both the authorities and environmental groups have launched various initiatives to nudge people to cut down on single-use plastics and disposables.\nThese initiatives include:  \nThe various moves have moved the needle in changing consumer behaviour in some aspects.\nIn January this year, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu said the number of plastic bags used at large supermarkets had dropped by 50 to 80 per cent since the mandatory minimum charge of five cents kicked in. \nIn response to TODAY's queries, a BreadTalk Group spokesperson said its S$0.10 charge for plastic bags implemented on April 1 has reduced such usage across its BreadTalk stores by 65 per cent. \n“We have also observed a notable increase in customers bringing their own bags to the store when purchasing our products,” she said.\n“To encourage greater adoption of this initiative, we provide customers with the option to have their bun purchases taped up upon request, thus facilitating easy placement into their reusable bags.” \nFor a retiree who wanted to be known only as Mrs Nathan, the shift towards eco-living started three years ago. \nCarrying a reusable bag at a FairPrice supermarket, the 65-year-old told TODAY that her children persuaded her to stop using plastic bags to “save the animals”. \nAs an avid news reader who has read about the effects of climate change, she added that the switch was easy for her. “If we don’t start (practising green habits), then our children and grandchildren won’t start. So we have to start somewhere.” \nMrs Nathan also said she rarely eats out, but when she does so with her family, she brings tiffin carriers in case there is unfinished food. \nAnother eco-conscious individual, social media executive Clara Quek, 25, said she would also bring her own bag, cup, and container when she goes out. \n“I started doing it during my internship two years ago as we always bought food back to the office to eat, and most of my colleagues brought containers.”\nMs Quek said that initially, washing and drying the containers after eating felt troublesome, but she soon adapted to it. \n“My motivation was to save on money paid for the plastic containers or cups, as I can save about S$1 on these disposables daily. If I ever forget to bring my container, I’ll choose to eat out instead,” she said. \nAlthough more shoppers in supermarkets appear to have swapped single-use plastic bags for their own reusable carriers, hawkers and other retailers told TODAY they have seen little change in consumer behaviour.\nOn a weekly basis, they encounter only a handful of customers who bring their own containers or bags, compared to hundreds who do not.\nMr Melvin Chew, 46, who runs Jin Ji Teochew Braised Duck hawker stall in Chinatown, said that consumers have come to accept that charges for plastic takeaway containers, as long as they are reasonable, are the norm. \n“When we started implementing takeaway charges of S$0.20 in the late 90s, there were many complaints. People thought hawkers should absorb the container cost.\n“But now, they’re probably used to it, unless you use something different like biodegradable packaging and charge S$0.50, maybe the complaints will come again,” he said.  \nAs with most hawkers, Mr Chew currently uses plastic containers for takeaways. He said he considered more eco-friendly alternatives such as biodegradable ones, but they cost twice as much. \nMr Chew explained that he does not profit from his charges for plastic containers.\nIn fact, he is making a slight loss as he is charging S$0.30 for large containers, even though they cost him about S$0.40 each. \nHe charges S$0.20 for small containers, which is his cost price. \nMs Doreen Winata, a franchisee of Shi Nian Pig Leg Rice in Kovan, said the rise in Goods and Services Tax (GST) to 9 per cent this year prompted her to start charging S$0.30 for takeaway containers. \nThe 27-year-old said that she initially absorbed this packing cost, but the GST hike made it difficult for her to sustain the business. After implementing the charge, she also switched to biodegradable containers to better justify the increase in price to her customers. \n“I actually hoped the S$0.30 charge would also make more people think about bringing containers, but I guess they are used to it because almost every stall charges for takeaway now.” \nOver at Hussain Muslim Food, also in Kovan, hawker Siti Leonita Minhad, 37, explained that it is tough for hawkers to cut down on the amount of plastic bags used because sometimes, they will need to pack different food separately to prevent spillage.\n“We also usually double-wrap hot food in plastic bags to ensure that it is safe until the customer reaches home.” \nCustomers who bring their own bags and cups to bubble tea stalls and bakeries are also few and far between, according to operators that TODAY spoke to. \nThose working at several bubble tea stalls, including Chi Cha San Chen, LiHo, and The Alley, said while they welcome customers who bring their own cups, they normally see such individuals less than five times a week. \nThe situation is also similar at food outlets such as Old Chang Kee, Dough Culture, and Jian Bo Shui Kueh, as well as bakeries nestled in public housing blocks. \nMs Chin Mei Lee, 60, a supervisor of an Old Chang Kee outlet in Bishan, said she has seen a slight uptick in customers who decline plastic bags when their food is being packed after the Government announced the minimum five-cent charge for plastic carriers in supermarkets last year, even though Old Chang Kee does not have such a charge.\n“Those who buy one or two snacks will tell us they don’t need a plastic bag, but there are only one or two such customers in a day,” she said.\nLikewise, Ms Widya Pujilestari, 43, who works at a bakery in Bishan, cited the same frequency of seeing only one to two customers a day declining plastic bags or asking for separate items to be packed together. \n“Generally, it would be difficult for bakeries like ours to reduce their use of plastics as we need to separate food with different taste profiles. We have sweet and savoury puffs, and we don’t pack them together unless the customer tells us it’s okay,” she added. \nEnvironmentalists say that given Singaporeans' busy lifestyle and preference for convenience, getting people to consciously adopt green habits remains a work in progress.  \n“Most people in Singapore, both consumers and businesses, are driven by dollars and cents — what is the cheapest and most convenient — and rarely by altruistic reasons,” said Ms Lin Qinghui, founder of D2L.sg, a one-stop food surplus and waste manager. \n“The culture here is to throw things away. It’s all about convenience, and it’s hard to change this because it’s ingrained in Singaporean society.” \nMr Rayson Lim, 27, who is unemployed, said he did try to pick up the habit of bringing his own container out for four to five months in 2022. Eventually, he stopped because he gave in to his laziness in washing the container after eating. \nCivil servant Shafiq Ahmad, 29, echoed Mr Lim’s sentiments. “I haven’t tried bringing my own container before, but just the thought of doing the washing after eating makes me feel it’s tiring and troublesome.” \nMs Tan Huileng, executive director of Zero Waste SG, said that the best way for consumers to change their habits, such as bringing their own containers, is to make it easy to include them in their daily routine. \n“Place them where they can be obviously seen so you can easily grab them and go,” she said.\n“Lastly, put some of these items in accessible areas in your journey, such as your car or office, so even if you forget to bring them from home, you still have access to your own container along the way.”  \nAmid the push to use less disposable plastic in everyday life, some companies have jumped on the bandwagon through moves such as charging for plastic bags and switching from conventional plastic bags or packaging to those using biodegradable plastic or paper and other non-plastic materials. \nHowever, there has also been debate on whether some of these practices constitute greenwashing. \nFor example, consumers have taken to online forums to discuss how one health and beauty retailer has started charging for plastic bags but still uses plenty of plastic for its house-brand water products. \nAnother discussion involved a food court chain that removed plastic straws but introduced cups with plastic caps for cold drinks, which sell for at least S$2. \nA consumer pointed out that cold drinks cost about S$1.40 a cup before the change. \nSome questioned whether the amount of plastic used for the cap is less than that of a straw, and whether this is just a gimmick to increase profit. \nOthers asked if paper or cloth alternatives for disposable plastics used by some retailers are actually more environmentally friendly.  \nMs Lin, the environmentalist, cautioned against advocating for non-plastic alternatives without considering Singapore’s “unique” waste management system.\nShe said that in Singapore, where all trash goes to the incinerator, plastics are efficiently incinerated, potentially reducing their harmful effects compared with countries relying on landfills.\nConversely, some other materials used to replace plastic come at a higher environmental cost as they might not burn as efficiently or as cleanly as plastic. \n“Plastic is not environmentally friendly, but if you look at the life cycle analysis across these materials, it’s the lesser evil because the alternatives, like woven cloth, fabric, cardboard, and paper, could actually bring more harm by leaving a larger carbon footprint,\" said Ms Lin.\nA life cycle assessment is a comprehensive method used to evaluate the environmental impacts of a product or service throughout its entire life cycle.\nIt considers various environmental factors, such as energy consumption, resource depletion, emissions to air, water, and soil, and waste generation at each stage of the product's life.\nSimilarly, Mr Yasser Amin, who heads Stridy, a non-profit organisation addressing urban waste management issues worldwide, said terms such as “biodegradable” or “compostable” often confuse the average person. \n“It's like a marketing tactic,” said Mr Yasser. He cited how some coffee and cafe chains switched from plastic to compostable straws, when these may not be the more environmentally friendly option.\n“Companies should be more aware and capable of conducting life cycle assessments to determine the true environmental impact of their alternatives. People need to question company claims more thoroughly.” \nOn NEA's website, in explaining why Singapore does not ban single-use plastics, the agency says that doing so may lead to a switch to disposables made from other materials such as paper or degradable plastics, “which also create waste, have their own set of environmental impacts and are not necessarily better for the environment”. \n“In view of the above, instead of advocating a switch to degradable materials, Singapore’s approach is to reduce the use of disposables regardless of material type, and promote the use of reusables.”\nA spokesperson for Starbucks, which is one of the cafe chains in Singapore using compostable straws, said in response to TODAY's queries that the company “strives to ensure sustainability and eco-friendliness across every touch point, taking proactive steps whenever feasible”.\n\"Our compostable straws are made from corn starch. In our efforts to eliminate plastic straws and reduce our environmental footprint, our cups and strawless lids are made of 100% recycled PET. This directly impacts the reduction in the usage of virgin PET in our ecosystem, reducing the overall carbon footprint,\" she said. \nPET stands for polyethylene terephthalate, a type of lightweight recyclable plastic commonly used to make beverage bottles and food packaging. \nThe spokesperson also listed various green initiatives by Starbucks Singapore, including a Borrow-A-Cup programme to encourage reuse, Bring Your Own Tumbler discounts, and a transition to eco-friendly materials for all packaging.\nA Skechers spokesperson said in response to TODAY's queries that it replaced plastic bags in 2019 with non-woven bags, which are resistant to tearing or fraying and are a more sustainable alternative to traditional woven fabrics.\nAs these bags can be used multiple times, they reduce the need for disposable plastic bags, “which, in turn, helps to reduce carbon footprint”, the spokesman added.\n“While we understand the concerns raised by environmentalists regarding alternative materials, we want to emphasise that… (we are) constantly evaluating and improving our processes to minimise our carbon footprint. \n“Our use of materials undergoes rigorous scrutiny to ensure we make meaningful strides towards a more sustainable future. We acknowledge the complexities involved and remain dedicated to transparent communication about our efforts,” she said. \nAt BreadTalk, customers who do not want to pay S$0.10 for a plastic bag have the option of buying a S$4 reusable bag made of polyester.\n“This material is known for its durability and water resistant qualities making it easy to wash if needed,” said the BreadTalk Group spokesman.\nThe BreadTalk Group, which also owns the cafe chain Toast Box, is also in the process of phasing out straws and switching to strawless lids at all Toast Box outlets, with a target to complete this transition by June.\nOther businesses that adopt and market their eco-friendly initiatives speak of similar challenges.\nMs Vanessa Kenchington, chief executive officer and founder of Plain Vanilla Bakery, said she and her team “openly admit” that they have had difficulties implementing plans to further their sustainability goals. \nThe bakery, which has several outlets across the island, ties boxes of cupcakes with twine to reduce the use of paper bags. Reusable paper bags are sold for S$0.50 each to those who need them. \nMs Kenchington said that while the company aims to be environmentally conscious and is committed to using more natural materials, balancing sustainability goals with the practicalities of running a viable business has been a constant challenge. \n\"When we looked into the possibility of composting our packaging independently, we realised there were not many packaging options that would meet the compostable requirement. It was hard to ensure the authenticity of suppliers claiming to offer compostable materials, which meant our packaging options would be very limited,” she said.\n“We accept that there are limitations to this for a business of our size when we try to be as sustainable as possible, and there is only so much we can do.” \nMs Germaine Lye, co-founder of sustainable fashion brand Our Barehands, said that it, too, is constantly balancing its priorities and has adopted a long-term approach to gradually work towards choosing sustainable practices as the business grows. \n“Currently, what guides our decision-making process is to choose the better alternative and one that does not undermine our objectives, to the best of our knowledge. \n“For example, we've chosen to use 100 per cent linen fabric over synthetic ones from day one. We’ve also requested transparency in the fabric production process. It's a learning process for everyone, including us,” she said. \nOur Barehands uses reusable cotton drawstring bags, which it provides free. \nIn response to TODAY’s queries on legislation or guidelines to tackle greenwashing, a spokesperson for the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) said that it is currently developing a guide to provide greater clarity to businesses on sustainability claims. \n“In recent years, CCCS has observed an increased interest from the public in environmental sustainability issues, and we have also noticed that more suppliers are making claims on the environmental impact of their products,” said the spokesperson. \n“Although CCCS has not received many complaints… CCCS sees the need to provide greater clarity to suppliers on the environmental claims that could amount to an unfair trade practice under the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act.”\nCCCS will share more details in due course, the spokesperson added.\nIn 2021, five government ministries released the Singapore Green Plan 2030, with ambitious targets to make Singapore more environmentally sustainable over the next decade. \nSome of these targets include reducing the amount of waste sent to the landfill by 20 per cent by 2026, and by 30 per cent by 2030. \nOne may question that the impact that Singapore, a small country with a population of over five million, can make in the grand scheme of things.\nBut experts such as Mr Tomas Louda, chief executive officer and co-founder of ETW, an international recycling company striving to eradicate single-use plastics, said that despite its small size, Singapore can make meaningful contributions to global environmental sustainability by leveraging its strengths in innovation and technology-driven solutions. \nHowever, Mr Louda said several challenges exist, such as limited public awareness about the consequences of plastic use and the difficulty of encouraging behavioural change.\nFurthermore, Singapore's infrastructure and waste management systems may not be fully prepared yet to handle the transition away from plastic.\nThis would then lead to logistical challenges in recycling and waste disposal.\n“Industries reliant on plastic packaging also struggle to find sustainable alternatives without compromising product safety and quality, while the absence of stringent regulations or incentives further impedes progress,” he said. \n“Addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach, including education and awareness campaigns to inform the public, investment in innovation for sustainable alternatives and recycling technologies, implementation of effective policies, and infrastructure development to support the transition towards a plastic-free future.” \nMr Jonathan Tostevin, chief executive officer of reusable takeaway container rental services Muuse, said that the authorities could improve infrastructure to boost public adoption of reusables. \n“On the policy side, we could test out what happens if we made reuse the default in defined areas like all tourist spots or Sentosa.\"\nMr Yasser of Stridy added that as the hawker culture is unique to Singapore and some other Southeast Asian countries, it would be challenging to look to different places like Europe and implement their policies here.\nSuch policies include a ban on the most common single-use plastic items, such as cutlery, stirrers and straws. \n“If we banned plastics in Singapore, we would have a riot. So whenever the Government introduces policies or laws, they have to take into consideration the whole of Singapore and how people would react,” he said. \n“And the hard truth is that only a small portion of Singaporeans care about sustainability.” \nHence, Mr Yasser said the authorities should also help make adopting reusables less burdensome on stakeholders and consumers. \n“For example, I believe the stallholders in food courts and hawker centres have to pay for washing fees. Why would they want to pay the monthly washing fees when buying styrofoam packets in the hundreds cost less? \n“So how can we look at doing away with washing fees or implementing new infrastructure changes, like building washing facilities in hawkers centres that don't have them?”  \nMr Yasser added that, ultimately, Singapore is a country built on convenience, and achieving sustainability will take time. \n“That’s why it’s very, very, very hard for us to shift. But it has to start with ourselves, as individuals, and how the difference we make will affect others because I know the ripple effect works,” he said. \n“I have been in the ripple effect. Someone organised that beach cleanup I first went to, and because of that, I'm here today. So I do my best. And if every one does their best, we're going to make a huge difference.” "

            "Article Body": "Each week, TODAY’s long-running Big Read series delves into the trends and issues that matter. This week, we look at how young professionals are leveraging social media and platforms such as LinkedIn to build a professional network. This is a shortened version of the full feature, which can be found here.\nSINGAPORE — When Mr Syukri Azman first reached out to a chief executive officer (CEO) of a logistics firm over professional networking platform LinkedIn, it was out of curiosity to find out how the company managed to secure a tender from a multinational corporation in Singapore. \nLittle did he know that the top-level executive would accept his cold call, and it would lead to a job offer. \nAs the CEO shared his business journey in a casual meet-up in 2018, Mr Syukri realised that he could fill a “gap” in the company by establishing training practices, given his experience in talent development. \nA few weeks later, the CEO initiated another meet up and offered him a full-time position, which he accepted.\nFor Mr Syukri, 30, a sales effectiveness specialist in a global data and analytics company, digital networking platforms have been the gateway to not only unexpected career opportunities, but also a means to build a professional brand.\nFor other more introverted young professionals, the emergence of digital networking is a dream, compared to traditional modes of in-person business card exchanges and etiquette-laden self-introductions.\nAs an introvert who avoids large crowds and describes meeting multiple people a day as “socially draining”, personal wealth manager Cristelle Lim found it easier to network with other professionals on LinkedIn and meeting clients around her age over Instagram.\n“When I first started in financial services, I got my first client from LinkedIn about three months into using the platform. It built my confidence that using social media is actually a way to network, and it is super effective for me until today too,” said Ms Lim, who is in her late 20s and has over 15,000 followers on LinkedIn.\nEmployers and human resource experts say networking is arguably more important today for workers given Singapore’s openness to global talent, a competitive business environment and the current economic uncertainties.\nNetworking is also not just for job-searching, but crucial too for one’s career progression.\nYet even as social media platforms provide new modes of connecting people, networking through traditional face-to-face interactions remains relevant, with such events still well-attended. \nMr Russell Chin, founder and managing director of interior design company Inspire ID Group, said that the industry has become “way more competitive” and will continue to be so, with around 4,000 to 5,000 interior design companies in Singapore. \nWith home renovations typically costing S$30,000 to S$60,000, Mr Chin said the “human touch” and a rapport between his employees and their contacts is essential, as homeowners will select those they trust for such “big ticket” purchases. \nFor his younger employees who are hesitant to build contacts, he exposes them to networking opportunities by taking them along to his own meetings.\nConsciously building a social media presence featuring one’s work is also crucial, added Mr Chin, who recalled one of his designers landing an organic lead from a homeowner who saw a TikTok video featuring a house he had designed on his personal account.\nMs Tuyen Do, a principal career coach at The Happy Mondays Co, noted that a personal referral from one’s network can differentiate a candidate in a “sea of digital profiles”, given the “increasingly global and competitive” job market. \nBeyond job referrals, tips on working life from the connections they make helps young professionals navigate complex workplace dynamics and etiquette in the early stages of their careers. \nMs Gwendolyn Say, a 24-year-old graphic designer, said that the connections she has built from her university days through classes and school projects have given her good advice on how to engage with clients. \n“A lot of the practical aspects of my job, I did not learn in school at all. It was specifically lacking for my degree, because so many people go into freelance work.\n“We weren’t taught any structure, like what is the industry rate, how to write an invoice or what you should put in your quotation, things that are genuinely as important as your skills in design,” said Ms Say. \nThese were skills that she built through friends who offered up-to-date advice on how to price and scope her services, to protect herself as a self-employed person and not undercut others in the industry. \nYoung professionals in their 20s and 30s from various industries who network actively told TODAY that they prioritise making genuine connections rather than having superficial, transactional relationships. \nThis desire to see an “authentic” self in a professional setting also brings a greater openness to more informal meetings and personal content being posted on professional platforms.\nMs Phoebe Zoe Ho, 29, said that she became more open to networking when she viewed it as “making friends” within the context of work, rather than a “cold and calculated business manoeuvre”. \n“When I was younger, networking came across as something transactional, and the notion of meeting people with an ulterior motive seemed exploitative,” said Ms Ho, an art director and set designer.\nWhile she knows of peers whose impression of LinkedIn is marred by superficial posts from people seeking clout or “posting for the sake of posting”, Ms Sherry Jiang, 32, said digital platforms have afforded her a space to connect with a larger audience through sharing personal, almost journal-like content that can range from discussing personal finance to documenting her startup journey. \n“Younger professionals are way more casual and informal. No more suits, handshakes and business cards. We want to actually get to know who you are,” said Ms Jiang, who is the co-founder and CEO of Peek, a financial product.\n“That person has a whole bunch of other qualities to evaluate, which are important when forming business partnerships because you want to know if you actually get along with someone and share common values, and it's hard to do that if it’s just robotically talking about work,” she added.\nHer most popular LinkedIn posts include:\nBeing digital natives, young professionals are “much more comfortable” networking online and foster connections quickly with people around the globe, said Ms Jaya Dass, managing director of permanent recruitment at executive search firm Randstad Asia-Pacific. \nMs Pooja Chhabria, a career expert from LinkedIn, said that its consumer research has shown young professionals to be the group devoting the “most time” to developing networking skills, with many indicating that they spend 30 minutes to two hours a month on honing the skill. \nA 2023 study by LinkedIn showed that the number of Gen Z professionals between the ages of 18 and 24 on its platform in Singapore have grown from 2.4 per cent in 2013 to 23.5 per cent in 2023. \nHowever, experts cautioned that online networking, with its far reach and ease of facilitating connections at a large scale, should not be seen as a complete replacement for offline interactions, which still offers nuanced and potentially deeper connections. \nMr Ang Yuit, president of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises, noted how body language can help to enable conversations to flow more easily, and the relationships to grow. \n“So, these ‘traditional’ modes of networking are here to stay. Digital platforms and social media have added layers to, but not replaced these so-called traditional networking modes.”\nOne organisation that focusses on physical networking among youths is Friendzone.\nThe social organisation runs community-centric events to foster peer support networks in various communities in Singapore. \nSince 2018, Friendzone has organised 250 gatherings which mainly attracts young professionals between the ages of 25 and 35. \nWhile co-founder of Friendzone Tham Jun Han acknowledged that digital platforms and remote work have changed the landscape of professional networking, he believes that in-person engagement remains “irreplaceable” in building lasting relationships. \n“While digital tools offer convenience and broad reach, they sometimes lack the depth of connection that face-to-face interactions can foster. There's an element of personal connection, such as non-verbal cues and spontaneous conversations, that only occurs in physical settings,” said Mr Tham.\nExperts such as Ms Pooja from LinkedIn add that professional networking is not a numbers game, as having a large number of connections may not necessarily give one an edge over other professionals. \n“If you are considering connecting to someone you don’t actually know, you might actually consider following them instead. When you follow someone, you will still see any posts they share,” she said.\nShe advised professionals on its platform to consider connecting with people they have “trusted relationships” with, such as co-workers, alumni, and business partners and following global industry leaders to see their posts on one’s feed for educational content.\n“Having the right network will improve the quality and relevance of your feed, the people who send you messages, and who engages with your content. Remember, you and your network are on a professional journey together, and the stronger your network, the further you can go.”\nMs Do the career coach added: “It’s essential to focus on the quality of your connections rather than merely increasing your follower count.\n“More followers on LinkedIn don't automatically equate to more meaningful relationships. Thoughtful engagement is essential to transform these digital ‘names’ into ‘real connections’ with potential.”  "

            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — When Mr Syukri Azman first reached out to a chief executive officer (CEO) of a logistics firm over professional networking platform LinkedIn, it was out of curiosity to find out how the company managed to secure a tender from a multinational corporation in Singapore. \nLittle did he know that the top-level executive would accept his cold call, and it would lead to a job offer. \nAs the CEO shared his business journey in a casual meet-up in 2018, Mr Syukri realised that he could fill a “gap” in the company by establishing training practices, given his experience in talent development. \nA few weeks later, the CEO initiated another meet-up and offered him a full-time position, which he accepted.\nFor Mr Syukri, 30, a sales effectiveness specialist in a global data and analytics company, digital networking platforms have been the gateway to not only unexpected career opportunities, but also a means to build a professional brand.\nHe now has over 7,800 followers on LinkedIn and has been given the title of “Top Voice” that the platform accords to particularly active members and experts in their field. \n“On LinkedIn, the professionals want people to hear their stories, and it’s easier to get connected with high profile professionals, because usually their profile is not managed by another person as compared to other social media,” he told TODAY. \nFor other more introverted young professionals, the emergence of digital networking is a dream, compared to traditional modes of in-person business card exchanges and etiquette-laden self-introductions.\nAs an introvert who avoids large crowds and describes meeting multiple people a day as “socially draining”, personal wealth manager Cristelle Lim found it easier to build a professional circle online. \nSince the Covid-19 pandemic, she has taken to networking with other professionals on LinkedIn and meeting clients around her age over Instagram, as her business heavily relies on referrals and a visible online social media presence.  \n“When I first started in financial services, I got my first client from LinkedIn about three months into using the platform. It built my confidence that using social media is actually a way to network, and it is super effective for me until today too,” said Ms Lim, who is in her late 20s and has over 15,000 followers on LinkedIn.\n“As I engage on LinkedIn from Monday to Friday, more people see my work and how I have helped others before and read my posts and thus are more open to meeting me, a complete stranger, online.”\nSimilarly, Ms Sabrina Ooi, 33, co-founder and CEO of Calm Collective Asia, uses LinkedIn “extensively” to form new connections with human resources leaders and potential speakers for her company’s talks and events. \nThe introvert also shares posts related to mental health, personal reflections and behind the scenes in her job as a workplace mental health and well-being consultant with her 38,000 followers on LinkedIn.\nYet even as social media provides new modes of networking, experts and employers say that networking in its traditional face-to-face form remains relevant, given the competitive job market and business conditions in Singapore.\nNetworking is also not just for job-searching, but important too for one’s career progression, which is why physical forms of networking are still well-attended, they add. \n“Today, while the mode of networking has changed quite fundamentally, the essence and purpose of networking has not changed. Networking is ultimately about establishing relationships,” said Mr Suhaimi Salleh, CEO of consultancy and professional training firm SSA Group.\n“What is more important is not the mode of networking but the outcomes of the network,” he added. \nHere, TODAY takes a closer look at how the professional networking landscape has evolved as young professionals blend their work and personal lives online, and what one should do to build a network online.\nYouths in their 20s and 30s from various industries who network actively told TODAY that they prioritise making genuine connections rather than having superficial, transactional relationships. \nThis desire to see an “authentic” self in a professional setting also brings a greater openness to more informal meetings and personal content being posted on professional networking platforms.\nWhile she knows of peers whose impression of LinkedIn is marred by superficial posts from people seeking clout or “posting for the sake of posting”, Ms Sherry Jiang, 32, said digital platforms have afforded her a space to connect with a larger audience.\nShe does so through sharing personal, almost journal-like content that can range from discussing personal finance to documenting her startup journey. \n“Younger professionals are way more casual and informal. No more suits, handshakes and business cards. We want to actually get to know who you are,” said Ms Jiang, who is the co-founder and CEO of Peek, a financial product.\n“That person has a whole bunch of other qualities to evaluate, which are important when forming business partnerships because you want to know if you actually get along with someone and share common values, and it's hard to do that if it’s just robotically talking about work,” she added.\nHer most popular LinkedIn posts include:\nMs Jiang said that she learnt how to network and build a presence online through writing posts on Twitter — now known as X — which was popular in the cryptocurrency space. \n“I got really comfortable with sharing things that I thought could be polarising, and people appreciate that, because they would rather you be real and say what you think than try to put out something that feels more edited or diplomatic.” \nAgreeing, Ms Phoebe Zoe Ho, 29, said that she became more open to networking when she viewed it as “making friends” within the context of work, rather than a “cold and calculated business manoeuvre”. \n“When I was younger, networking came across as something transactional, and the notion of meeting people with an ulterior motive seemed exploitative,” said Ms Ho, an art director and set designer.\nSimilarly, Mr Matthew Ng, 23, who works in marketing, knows that networking is “very important” in his industry as freelance jobs are mostly secured through referrals from people he has met. \nYet the idea of networking “to climb the ladder of success” in more traditional environments like career fairs feels too transactional and formal for him. \n“I’ve seen other people network and being cutthroat about it, viewing people as dispensable in a way to help them get to what they want and it’s a goodbye after that,” said Mr Ng.  \n“Being in the creative industry, most of the professional relationships are formed organically through friendships. I find it weird to go up to people and solely ask them about work, job prospects, salary ranges.”\nFor Ms Calissa Man, a 24-year-old working in the venture capital industry, building confidence to network and navigate conversations was a skill she had to actively hone. \nWhile she initially feared rejection and was not sure if she would be able to meaningfully contribute to her contacts, she has made an effort to reciprocate the advice and guidance she has received from mentors. \n“It's also about being authentic and generous to the newfound friends, mentors and sponsors you make along the way too. At its core, networking is a two-way street — that's something I strive to bring to every interaction, catch up or coffee chat.”\nBeyond job referrals, tips on working life from the connections they make helps young professionals navigate complex workplace dynamics and etiquette in the early stages of their careers. \nFor 26-year-old Melissa Sta Maria, who is planning to make a career switch from sales to the media industry, reaching out to people in her target industry has equipped her with resume skills and a better sense of the companies she would like to join. \n“Through networking, people share the negatives of a job and they are very upfront about their health scares, work life balance, which are things you don't hear about in the interview and through reading Glassdoor reviews.”\nAgreeing, Ms Gwendolyn Say, a 24-year-old graphic designer, said that the connections she has built from her university days through classes and school projects have given her good advice on how to engage with clients. \n“A lot of the practical aspects of my job, I did not learn in school at all. It was specifically lacking for my degree, because so many people go into freelance work.\n“We weren’t taught any structure, like what is the industry rate, how to write an invoice or what you should put in your quotation, things that are genuinely as important as your skills in design,” said Ms Say. \nThese were skills that she built through contacts who offered up-to-date advice on how to price and scope her services as well as to protect herself as a self-employed person and not undercut others in the industry. \nEmployers and human resource experts say networking is arguably more important today for workers given Singapore’s openness to global talent, a competitive business environment and the current economic uncertainties. \nMs Faatimah Haleemah Mohammad Ansaari, director of Universal Landscape and Construction, has noticed some younger employees having a fear of networking, especially with more experienced professionals, as they may feel like they may not be able to “catch up” during conversations due to their inexperience. \nYet networking is crucial given the nature of the landscaping sector. \n“Most of the companies here are older companies, so they have the older mindset where the work is given to people who you have a good relationship with,” said Ms Faatimah.\nMr Russell Chin, founder and managing director of interior design company Inspire ID Group, said that the industry has become “way more competitive” and will continue to be so, with around 4,000 to 5,000 interior design companies in Singapore. \nWith home renovations typically costing S$30,000 to S$60,000, Mr Chin said the “human touch” and a rapport between his employees and their contacts is essential, as homeowners will pick those they trust for such “big ticket” purchases. \nFor his younger employees who are hesitant to build contacts, he exposes them to networking opportunities by taking them along to his own meetings.\nHe hosts internal networking sessions for his team to meet with suppliers, clients and collaborating brands, as well as interior design carnivals which allow his employees to network with homeowners directly. \nConsciously building a social media presence featuring one’s work is also crucial, added Mr Chin, who recalled one of his designers landing a sales lead from a homeowner who saw a TikTok video featuring a house he had designed on his personal account.\n“If you are not tech savvy and social media savvy, you will lose out, so the impetus to take the initiative is definitely there,” said Mr Chin.\n\nMs Tuyen Do, a principal career coach at The Happy Mondays Co, noted that a personal referral from one’s network can differentiate a candidate in a “sea of digital profiles”, given the “increasingly global and competitive” job market. \n“For the employers, leveraging networks and referrals can streamline the hiring process, reduce costs, and provide them access to a pool of passive candidates who might not actively seek new opportunities but are open to them when presented by trusted contacts,” said Ms Do. \nMore than career advancement alone, a well-connected network can help professionals stay up to date with critical insights about industry shifts, technological innovations and evolving best practices. \n“Professional networking is about finding the right mix of authenticity and strategic thinking. It's essentially about creating a network of contacts — your own ‘black book’ — who you can turn to for advice, inspiration, learning opportunities or introductions,” said Ms Do. \nWhile people traditionally network through physical engagements with limited prior information and poorer quantity of connections established within a single session, digital networking platforms mean professionals today can establish their network with a click of a button. \nNetworking practices like exchanging business cards have fallen out of fashion with younger professionals, who may think of it as “cumbersome” or “environmentally unfriendly”, said Ms Jessly Chew, associate director at recruitment agency Michael Page Singapore. \n“The online platform is a good way for professionals to discover the different types of communities available, preview the types of content or activity available and identify mutual connections with existing members. \n“This allows people to be more informed about the network that they are approaching and whether it’s relevant for them,” said Ms Chew. \nBeing digital natives, young professionals are “much more comfortable” networking online and foster connections quickly with people around the globe, said Ms Jaya Dass, managing director of permanent recruitment in Asia Pacific at executive search firm Randstad. \nLinkedIn is the world's “largest professional network” with over 1 billion members globally, including over three million users in Singapore. \nMs Pooja Chhabria, a career expert from LinkedIn, said that its consumer research has shown young professionals to be the group devoting the “most time” to developing networking skills, with many indicating that they spend 30 minutes to two hours a month on honing the skill. \nA 2023 study by LinkedIn showed that the proportion of Gen Z professionals between the ages of 18 and 24 on its platform in Singapore has grown from 2.4 per cent in 2013 to 23.5 per cent in 2023. \nOne “major shift” in networking is the confluence of online profiles and in-person networking as online platforms like LinkedIn gain credibility, said Ang Yuit, president of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (ASME). \n“These days, people do Google you or check out your LinkedIn as a precursor to approaching you in person. Prospects and new contacts often check you out in quite some detail before and after meeting you before deciding how they should continue to engage with you,” said Mr Ang. \nAgreeing, Ms Do said young professionals should view their entire online presence as part of their digital networking strategy.\nShe pointed to a 2018 survey by employment site CareerBuilder which found that 70 per cent of employers screen potential candidates on social media, and 54 per cent have decided against hiring someone based on what they discovered. \n“The rise of social media has made networking more accessible and scalable, albeit with unique challenges,” said Mr Kenji Naito, CEO of recruitment firm Reeracoen Group.\nSome of these challenges include information overload, with a vast amount of content and connections to sift through to identify meaningful networking opportunities, and difficulty maintaining sustained engagement over time as online interactions tend to be more fleeting.\n“Young professionals often prioritise online networking due to its convenience and reach. However, there's a growing awareness of the need for authentic connections and meaningful interactions,” he added.\nMr Syukri, the sales effectiveness specialist who is a “Top Voice” on LinkedIn, said those who want to successfully connect with an online audience have to “play around a little bit” and share their personality beyond their day job on their professional networking platforms. \nNot only does he make it a priority to make new connections on LinkedIn and comment on posts that resonate with him, he also regularly posts commentary about current affairs, even on more “sensitive” subjects like religion and politics, as that reflects his values and helps him stand out in the “noisy world” of online networking. \nHe recalled viewing an individual’s “heartfelt” story about saving enough money from his paycheck to buy his first bed frame which attracted a lot of views on LinkedIn.\nWhile being vulnerable and sharing one’s personal life in a professional setting can seem daunting at first, Mr Syukri said being open to posting such content can be the key to building connections because others may relate to similar struggles.\nMs Pooja from LinkedIn also emphasised that building a network on the platform is not a “numbers game”, as having a large number of connections may not necessarily give one an “edge” over other professionals. \n“If you are considering connecting to someone you don’t actually know, you might actually consider following them instead. When you follow someone, you will still see any posts they share,” she said.\nShe advised professionals on its platform to consider connecting with people they have “trusted relationships” with, such as co-workers, alumni, and business partners and following global industry leaders to see their posts on one’s feed for educational content.\n“Having the right network will improve the quality and relevance of your feed, the people who send you messages, and who engages with your content. Remember, you and your network are on a professional journey together, and the stronger your network, the further you can go.”\nMs Do the career coach added: “It’s essential to focus on the quality of your connections rather than merely increasing your follower count.\n“More followers on LinkedIn don't automatically equate to more meaningful relationships. Thoughtful engagement is essential to transform these digital ‘names’ into ‘real connections’ with potential.”  \nExperts cautioned that online networking, with its far reach and ease of facilitating connections at a large scale, should not be seen as a complete replacement for offline interactions, which still offers nuanced and potentially deeper connections. \n“The internet has made professional networking much more dynamic and accessible than before, allowing professionals to transcend geographical limits and foster instant connections with others,” said Ms Dass of Randstad. \n“However, messages may lack subtle social cues and genuinity, reinforcing the importance of human connection.”\nMr Ang from ASME added that most people still prefer meeting up in person, as body language helps to enable the conversations to flow more easily, and the relationships to grow. \n“So, these ‘traditional’ modes of networking are here to stay. Digital platforms and social media have added layers to, but not replaced these so-called traditional networking modes.”\nCertain sectors like law and finance may also emphasise formal networking events, while informal meetups or social media usage to connect may be more prevalent in the technology and creative fields, added Ms Do. \nBeing in the venture capital industry, Mr John Tay, a 34-year-old head of partnerships at Tin Men Capital, needs to meet people in the startup ecosystem on a daily basis. \n“It is more important than ever to have an online presence. In Asian culture, it’s often frowned upon to stand out or be vocal. But in a sea of noise and signals, out of sight, out of mind. \n“You have to show up at events, and post content online consistently. Once you get the hang of this, you’ll realise that more people reach out to you.”\nMr Tay said that he prefers to conduct a “hybrid” of digital and physical networking, with about 80 per cent of his networking conducted in person. \nHe meets at least three new stakeholders every week, through follow-ups from networking events, introductions from trusted contacts or from cold calls over LinkedIn, which he uses daily. \nThis year, he co-founded a Startup Walking Tour with a friend, to bring foreign guests on a walking tour through a typical Singapore neighbourhood, while providing an “insider’s look” at Singapore’s tech ecosystem. \nThrough the three-hour tour, he plans to give visitors a “solid download of local culture” and enable connections with local organisations which can facilitate business and investments through Singapore’s startups. \nWith the rise of more flexible work arrangements, co-working spaces that mix private offices and communal areas also facilitate networking between solo entrepreneurs as well as employees of small- and medium-sized enterprises and local offices for multinational corporations. \nCo-working company JustCo told TODAY it has seen good attendance at its weekly members’ events. In JustCo's Singapore centres, they have held over 270 events in 2023 and 90 events so far this year.\n“In the past, the more common type of networking event would likely have been organised by business chambers or agencies representing specific industries. At such events, professionals typically met people from similar backgrounds, and foster industry-specific collaborations,” said Ms Shirlene Sim, vice-president and head of JustCo Singapore. \n“However, the rise of coworking has provided a platform for people from all walks of life and sectors to come together and work efficiently in a shared workspace.” \nOne outlier in the trend towards digital-first networking is Friendzone, a social organisation that runs community-centric events to foster peer support networks in various communities in Singapore. \nSince 2018, Friendzone has organised 250 gatherings which mainly attracts young professionals between the ages of 25 and 35. \nIt also organises “Out of Office”, a networking series that caters to young professionals from various industries including technology and the social sectors, which attracts around 40 attendees per event on average. \nMr Tham Jun Han, co-founder of Friendzone, said: “We have observed that many young professionals often feel lost and isolated as they navigate the complex dynamics of workplace etiquette and politics. \n“It's challenging for them to discuss these issues with colleagues who may be at different stages in their lives, particularly those who are more established in their careers.”\n \nWhile acknowledging that digital platforms and remote work have changed the landscape of professional networking, he believes that in-person engagement remains “irreplaceable” in building lasting relationships. \n“While digital tools offer convenience and broad reach, they sometimes lack the depth of connection that face-to-face interactions can foster. There's an element of personal connection, such as non-verbal cues and spontaneous conversations, that only occurs in physical settings,” said Mr Tham. \nTo pair the strengths of its events with digital networking, Friendzone encourages participants to form their own chat groups post-event, and adds participants to industry-specific Telegram groups.\nWith experts expecting the future of networking to involve a further integration of digital tools, what can young professionals do to stand out in a crowded online space? \nHere are some top tips from young professionals and human resources experts:  "

            "Article Body": "Each week, TODAY’s long-running Big Read series delves into the trends and issues that matter. This week, we look at why youths prefer to text than to get on a phone call, both at work and socially. This is a shortened version of the full feature, which can be found here.\nSINGAPORE — Before making a phone call, 26-year-old Nivani Elangovan would prepare herself by mentally mapping out what could happen during the tele-conversation and jotting down pointers on post-it notes for reference. \nTyping a phone number into her seldom-used call app on her handphone is an anxiety-inducing task, let alone having to hold a conversation.\n“I hate phone calls… because I’m a lot more anxious about things that are uncertain. I like having structure and being as prepared as I can,” she told TODAY over the phone. \n“Over email or text messages, at least it's in writing and I have time to think about how to reply and what I want to say. When over the phone, there’s so much uncertainty about what could play out.\n“Even if I do have to make a phone call, I will take a post-it note and write down all the different points I need to cover during my phone call,” Ms Elangovan said.\nMs Elangovan’s case of “phone anxiety” is not uncommon among digital natives who have grown up amid computers and the internet. \nIn Australia, a survey last year of more than 1,000 Gen Zers aged 18 to 26 found that only one in 10 prefer to talk to family and friends via a phone call.\nAbout 49 per cent said speaking over the phone made them anxious, while six in 10 dreaded making or accepting a phone call, according to the survey conducted by Australia’s telecommunications company More Telecom in May 2023. \nThis texting preference by Gen Z is not a recent phenomenon; their millennial counterparts — those aged between 27 and 42 — have been doing so as early as 2009, sociologists told TODAY.\nAccording to a survey by the Washington-based Pew Research Centre released in 2012, the typical American teen aged 12 to 17 was sending and receiving 60 messages in 2011, up from 50 in 2009. \nThe same survey found that 26 per cent of American teens were calling their friends in 2011 using their handphones, down from 38 per cent in 2009.\nIn Singapore, 12 youths aged 35 and under told TODAY that texting is the main mode of communication for them, even though three of them still prefer calling. \nTODAY’s interviews with those in their 40s and 50s point to a generational split when it comes to texting and calling. \n“Texting on the computer is fine since the screen is bigger and it's easier to read. But on the phone with the small keyboard, it can be quite difficult,” said Ms Angie Neo, 59, an administrative executive with a real estate firm.\n“Calling is just more straightforward since you just say what you need and get the message across,” she added.\nThe way older people text also differs from youths, such as using fewer abbreviations and taking no offence when their messages are \"blue ticked\", or left read but unreplied.\nFor youths, sending a message and getting a signal through two blue ticks indicates that it has been read by the recipient. Thus, for them, a non response is a rude sign, suggesting that they are being ignored. \nFor older text recipients, this is a non-problem as the blue ticks are simply an acknowledgment that the message has been read.\nMr Edwin Yeo, 56, general manager of public relationship firm SPRG Singapore, added that youth's preference for texting even at the workplace can have its downsides.\n\"Calls can be more convenient when brainstorming and making clarifications... without misunderstanding as you can hear their tone of voice, unlike text.”\nYouths who prefer texting cite convenience of replying anywhere and anytime and having the time to think of a reply as among some of the benefits.\nThey note that messaging applications also have unique features that make communication more engaging, such as “video bubbles” which allow youths to send short videos of themselves.\nEven among youngsters who prefer phone calls, texting is still the primary means of communicating.\nEighteen-year-old Shayna Choo said she spends roughly two hours weekly calling her boyfriend, but at least eight hours texting her friends during a typical week. \n“It’s much easier to catch up with them over call, and you feel closer when you hear their voice,” said the second-year business student at Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP).\n“But honestly, I text much more than I call (my friends) because my close friends and I have our own lives and it’s hard to find a common time.\"\nLike other youths, Ms Choo’s calls are reserved for close friends and family members. And if she were to call, these are often scheduled unless it is for something she considers urgent.\nIf the call is not scheduled, youths told TODAY that they think twice before picking up.\n“If it’s a close friend, I would worry about what's going on and pick up the call (assuming) it’s something urgent. If it's someone I’m not close to, I’ll question why before picking up or might text back asking why they are calling,” said Ms Tay Xiu Qin, 18, a second-year banking and finance student at NP.\nYouths told TODAY there are several nuances when texting that help them derive social cues. This includes how they type, the type of emoji used and the way they express their laughter over text.\nIn the workplace, their text messages are slightly more formal, as they type without abbreviations. They also give their messages a second read to fix any grammatical errors before sending it out.\nDr Carol Soon, principal research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies, said Gen Zers' preference for texting is “unsurprising” as several studies have shown that millennials have similar preferences.\nTexting provides youths with more control over their schedules as they can communicate whenever they want, allows them to multi-task and avoid small talk, she noted.\n“This reason also accounts for why people from other generations are also veering to texting, with phone calls used for urgent communications or speaking with elderly members in the family,” said Dr Soon.\nAssociate Professor Tan Ern Ser, a sociologist at the National University of Singapore, noted there are some negatives in texting.\nFor one thing, youths’ reliance on texting might mean more misunderstandings as they lose social cues such as facial expressions, and possibly missing out on learning and practising social interaction skills.\n“To me, another negative of only texting is when one misses an emergency call from someone who has no time to write a text, is incapable of texting — such as a senior who is neither literate, nor able to use the text features of the smartphone — or have access to only a landline at home,” he said.\nDr Andrew Yee, an assistant professor at the Singapore University of Technology and Design, added that problems may also arise if conversation partners have different preferences of communication. \n“For example, if my co-worker prefers speaking on the phone, they may find my texting or emailing very impersonal, which may lead to inefficiencies in communication,” he said.\nDespite the pitfalls, Dr Yee said he does not view the new forms of communication as problematic.\n“As long as the purposes of communication, such as building relationships and conveying meaning, are satisfactorily achieved, I am not sure if we need to worry too much about it,” he said."

When over the phone, there’s so much uncertainty about what could play out.\n“Even if I do have to make a phone call, I will take a post-it note and write down all the different points I need to cover during my phone call,” Ms Elangovan said.\nWhy put herself through such a hassle when phone calls used to be a simple dial-and-talk affair?\nThe fresh graduate from Nanyang Technological University said she fears coming off as unprepared or confused when taking a call.\nThe post-it notes help settle her nerves, Ms Elangovan said, citing a recent call with a hirer for a potential job as an example.\n“I had a lot of information about the job but none of it (written down) in black and white,” she said.\n“So when I was calling them back to clarify details —  such as the job interview and pay package —  my post-it notes helped me as I was just checking things off… (ensuring) I covered everything.”\nMs Elangovan’s case of “phone anxiety” is not uncommon among digital natives who have grown up amid computers and the internet. \nIn Australia, a survey last year of more than 1,000 Gen Zers aged 18 to 26 found that only one in 10 prefer to talk to family and friends via a phone call.\nAbout 49 per cent said speaking over the phone made them anxious, while six in 10 dreaded making or accepting a phone call, according to the survey conducted by Australia’s telecommunications company More Telecom in May 2023. \nAnother survey by European telecommunications provider Sky Mobile of 1,000 youths aged 18 to 24 in October 2023 also found that a quarter of them actively ignored phone calls, while more than half, or 57 per cent, admitted to ignoring their parents' phone calls.\nThis texting preference by Gen Z is not a recent phenomenon; their millennial counterparts — those aged between 27 and 42 — have been doing so as early as 2009, sociologists told TODAY.\nAccording to a survey by the Washington-based Pew Research Centre released in 2012, the typical American teen aged 12 to 17 was sending and receiving 60 messages in 2011, up from 50 in 2009. \nThe same survey found that 26 per cent of American teens were calling their friends in 2011 using their handphones, down from 38 per cent in 2009.\nIn Singapore, 12 youths aged 35 and under told TODAY that texting is the main mode of communication for them, even though three of them still prefer calling. \nWhile advocates of texting cite convenience of replying anywhere and anytime, and having the time to think of a reply as among the benefits, TODAY’s interviews with those in their 40s and 50s point to a generational split on the issue. \n“Texting on the computer is fine since the screen is bigger and it's easier to read. But on the phone with the small keyboard, it can be quite difficult,” said Ms Angie Neo, 59, an administrative executive with a real estate firm.\n“Calling is just more straightforward since you just say what you need and get the message across,” she added.\nStill, Ms Neo and several older interviewees told TODAY that they are adapting to the change in communicating habits by texting their children and younger colleagues more. \nSociologists also pointed out that texting is not all positive as it could possibly impact communication skills due to the lack of certain social cues like a person’s expression and the tone of their voice.\nWith texting likely to remain as the main form of communication for zoomers and millennials in the near future, TODAY looks at the impact it will have on the way people interact with each other both at home and in the workplace.\nLike many of her generation these days, the first thing Ms Elangovan does when she wakes up is to check her mobile phone for texts sent overnight. \nWithout leaving the comfort of her bed, she scans through each notification or message on her phone apps — Telegram, WhatsApp, Instagram followed by Discord — to see if she has missed anything important.\n“I don’t always reply immediately unless it's something urgent, perhaps a friend asking for help,” Ms Elangovan said.\nFor 43-year-old Mariasusai Maria Sophia, her two children’s habit of texting before getting out of bed often triggers a lengthy nagging from her on a daily basis.\n“I always tell them to at least wash up first, get out of bed before continuing whatever you want to do,” said the manager at a construction and engineering firm.\nHer two children, aged 18 and 20, are often on their phones texting. Even with her, they prefer to text even though Ms Sophia has made it clear that she would rather have a phone call from them.\n“I really don’t know what is in their mind, (and) why this generation only text and text. They’re just not socialising as much,” she lamented.\n“Maybe I’m too old school and traditional, but when you talk over the phone, there’s a connection while texting is just monotonous.” \nDespite her reservations, Ms Sophia and several others in their 40s and 50s told TODAY that they have learnt to adapt to the younger generations’ growing reliance on messaging applications such as WhatsApp. \nEven as older individuals acknowledge that texting does have its uses, such as having a written message to refer to, the way they text or respond to texting can sometimes raise eyebrows, or even cause frustration, among the younger ones. \nReceiving images of “good morning” is the norm for Mr Javier Koh, 23, a Singapore Management University (SMU) business undergraduate, as his mother sends different pictures each day.\nAlthough he and his two siblings find such images annoying, Mr Koh has accepted it as a “boomer” thing, and tries to see the pictures as an expression of his mother’s love for them.\n“I always wonder where and how she gets different pictures each day,” he joked.\nWhen Mr Koh sends a message to his parents, the way he writes them also differs from the ones he sends to friends. There are fewer vulgarities, emojis, jokes and most importantly — no abbreviations.\n“If I use one, they’ll ask what it means. Like ‘TTYL’ which stands for ‘talk to you later’,” he said.\n“It’s more troublesome to explain since these abbreviations are meant to help us type faster. I'd rather just spell it out from the start.”\nThe “blue tick” —  a feature on WhatsApp that signals if the receiver has seen a message sent to them —  also means different things for recipients of different ages, which can result in some unhappiness. \nFor youths, sending a message and getting a signal through two blue ticks indicates that it has been read by the recipient. Thus, for them, a non-response is a rude sign, indicating that they are being ignored. \nTo avoid unnecessary drama, some opt to turn off the blue-tick function on their messaging apps. Others like Mr Koh just read their notifications but do not click into their messaging app.\n“Or if I really don’t have time to reply to the message, I’ll at least react with an emoji as a form of acknowledgement because as someone who has been ‘blue tick-ed’ (ignored), it’s not a nice feeling to be left hanging,” Mr Koh said.\nBut for some older text recipients, the blue tick is simply an acknowledgment that the message has been read.\n“Honestly, there isn’t a need to reply. As long as they see the message, it’s good enough for me,” said Ms Sophia.\nMr Edwin Yeo, general manager of public relationship firm SPRG Singapore said that youth's preference for texting can have its downsides.\n“Youths have a fear of rejection that when they call someone, they might ignore or hang up on them,” he said.\n“However, calls can be more convenient when brainstorming and making clarifications... without misunderstanding as you can hear their tone of voice, unlike text.”\nFor many young ones, their preference for texting boils down to one word — convenience. One can text while out and about, lazing at home, or even in class. And sending a message to a friend or family member takes mere seconds.\nBut add all those seconds together, and many youths admit that they actually spend hours a day glued to their messaging apps.\n“You can reply anywhere, anytime. Your phone is with you all the time,” said 23-year-old SMU business undergraduate Loy Ming Hao.\nLike other youths, he noted that messaging applications also have unique features that make communication more engaging, such as “video bubbles” which allow youths to send short videos of themselves.\nEven among youngsters who prefer phone calls, texting is still the primary means of communicating.\nEighteen-year-old Shayna Choo said she spends roughly two hours weekly calling her boyfriend, but at least eight hours texting her friends during a typical week. \n“It’s much easier to catch up with them over call, and you feel closer when you hear their voice,” said the second-year business student at Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP).\n“But honestly, I text much more than I call (my friends) because my close friends and I have our own lives and it’s hard to find a common time.\n“It’s also weird to call people I’m not close to like an acquaintance… The conversation might get awkward since there’s not much we can talk about.” \nLike other youths, Ms Choo’s calls are reserved for close friends and family members. And if she were to call, these are often scheduled unless it is for something she considers urgent.\nIf the call is not scheduled, youths told TODAY that they think twice before picking up.\n“If it’s a close friend, I would worry about what's going on and pick up the call (assuming) it’s something urgent. If it's someone I’m not close to, I’ll question why before picking up or might text back asking why they are calling,” said Ms Tay Xiu Qin, 18, a second-year banking and finance student at NP.\n“But if it’s a number I don’t recognise, I assume it’s a scammer and don’t answer at all.”\nThere are also spaces where talking on the phone would be inappropriate, such as on public transport.\nMr Koh, the SMU student, pointed out that calling someone would disturb the peace and might elicit stares from other commuters.\n“If I’m on the train, it's also too noisy sometimes and the other person on the line cannot hear me. I also don’t want to talk about something personal like what I’m doing that day while other passengers can hear and might eavesdrop,” he said.\nInstead, Mr Koh would hang up and immediately text the person that he is unable to speak over the phone.\nWhen it comes to texting friends and family in social settings, the youths told TODAY that there are certain nuances that they are mindful of, too. It’s not just the “blue ticks” but the way they write their messages.\nEmojis, for one, determine the seriousness of a text.\n“For example, I’m going through a minor inconvenience so I text my friends ‘OMG this is killing me’ with several crying emojis. My parents might take the message literally if they receive it and worry about me, but my friends know my message is a light-hearted complaint and not me actually dying,” said Mr Koh.\nFor Ms Lee, a 20-year-old university student who declined to give her full name, the way people type out their laughter also signifies different things.\n“If you say ‘haha’, you’re being passive-aggressive or sarcastic. But if you repeat ‘ha’ more than three times, you genuinely mean it,” she said.\nMs Elangovan added that if her friends change the way they type —  such as adding a punctuation mark when they usually do not use them, writing in a proper sentence and sending a single long message instead of a series of texts — alarm bells ring in her head.\n“To me, it signals maybe something isn’t right and they might be upset or are acting passive-aggressive towards me,” she said.\n“It’s kind of like the tone of someone’s voice when you’re speaking to someone.” \nJust like with friends and family, youths also rely on text messages when chatting with their colleagues — especially with hybrid work arrangements becoming more common post-pandemic.\nFor 26-year-old Hilman, who declined to share his full name, text messages to fellow colleagues are not as formal as emails, as he uses the occasional emoji.\n“It’s boring to always respond with a straight ‘noted, thanks’ right? Sometimes I use a thumbs-up emoji and reply with a ‘cool’,” said the engineer.\n“But when it comes to more complicated things I have to relay to my colleagues, a call is honestly easier because we can just iron things out immediately. So although I prefer texting, it's (a phone call) just more convenient.”\nWhile making a call may be more convenient in relaying urgent information at short notice, receiving such a call can be nerve-racking.\n“After work, if I receive a call from someone above me, I hesitate to answer but have to,” said Mr Lionel Lim, 28, who works in the military. \n“There’s a fear that I might be getting called back (to work). Or that something has gone wrong.”\nWhile such messages would not sound any better in a text, Mr Lim said hearing the phone ring sends shivers down his spine.\nAs for Ms Lee, the university student, having instructions over text not only spares her the anxiety of having to speak to a boss, but also removes any possible misunderstanding that could result from a call. \n“Once, my boss gave me instructions over the phone, and later scolded me by claiming that he did not give me the instructions,” she recalled of her part-time job at a food-and-beverage outlet. “If it was over text, at least it would have been in black and white.”\nEven if she may use an emoji or two when communicating with her colleagues and employer, Ms Lee admitted that her texting style is different when it comes to friends.\nDescribing work-related texts as “more formal”, Ms Lee avoids abbreviations and would give her message a second read to fix any grammatical errors before sending it out.\nFor Ms Neo, the administrative executive, her WhatsApp application on her work computer takes up half the screen, rather than her email.\n“I may be working in the office, but some of my younger colleagues will text me instead of just coming up to my desk and asking me in person,” she said.\n“I sometimes wonder why they don’t want to walk over even though we aren’t that far away from each other.\n“But to be honest, texting colleagues isn’t that bad. It’s easier to gossip since you don’t need to watch who might be overhearing you conversation,” she said, laughing.\nMr Yeo of SPRG Singapore said that although some of his younger employees are not keen on phone calls, texting can be counter-productive in the workplace. \n“When we have group chats, sometimes people hesitate to reply and you have to prompt them one by one. But if we have an in-person meeting or one over video-conferencing, people are more open to speak,” said the 56-year-old.\n“So when it comes to meetings and discussions, calls and in-person meetings are still the way to go.”\nHe has also found himself unintentionally inciting fear in his employees when he drops them a text message, as they often assume he is angry based on his text.\n“All these social cues are lost like the tone of my voice. But I’m not angry, I’m just asking them something,” Mr Yeo said.\nMs Dione Ng, associate manager of Michael Page Singapore, said that the loss of nuance and tone leading to misunderstandings is one downside of texting in the workplace, alongside difficulty in building rapport and trust.\nHowever, there are several benefits, such as clearer record of communications, and the ability to focus on the task at hand before responding to messages. It also helps employees working remotely to communicate with one another.\nAs to whether it is appropriate to communicate via text at work, Ms Ng said it depends on the situation.\n“The best approach is open communication. Letting colleagues know your preferred communication style and being open to theirs.\n“Not everyone may be comfortable with certain technology, some older workers may miss the more formal communication styles of the past.”\nMs Ng added that there is a need to consider how appropriate certain messages, such as video or audio ones, are depending on the company culture or the nature of the message.\n“Some workplaces have a more casual culture where video messages might be perfectly acceptable. Simple updates could also work in these formats, while complex topics are better suited for emails or video conferencing,” she said.\nBut Ms Ng cautioned that companies adapting to the growing reliance on texting should not be quick to abandon phone calls since the latter can help build rapport among colleagues and with external clients, allow for immediate clarification and conveying urgent messages, among other things.\nDr Carol Soon, principal research fellow from the Institute of Policy Studies, said Gen Z's preference for texting is “unsurprising” as several studies have shown that millennials have similar preferences.\nTexting provides youths with more control over their schedules as they can communicate whenever they want, allows them to multi-task and avoid small talk, she noted.\n“This reason also accounts for why people from other generations are also veering to texting, with phone calls used for urgent communications or speaking with elderly members in the family,” said Dr Soon.\nDr Andrew Yee, an assistant professor at the Singapore University of Technology and Design, admitted that these are reasons why he prefers texting as well.\n“In a phone call, it is often more demanding, as we need to pay full attention to the person on the other line and respond immediately. There is likely a lower sense of control over the communication process as we need to respond immediately,” said the sociologist. \n“When we text, we can carefully craft what we want to convey and take our time to respond. As such, there is a greater sense of control. On various platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram, we can even edit and delete our messages.”\nSuch features are especially important for people who are introverted or socially anxious, he added.\nAssociate Professor Tan Ern Ser, a sociologist at the National University of Singapore, noted there are some negatives in texting. For one, youths’ reliance on texting might mean more misunderstandings as they lose social cues such as facial expressions, and possibly missing out on learning and practising social interaction skills.\n“To me, another negative of only texting is when one misses an emergency call from someone who has no time to write a text, is incapable of texting —  such as a senior who is neither literate, nor able to use the text features of the smartphone —  or have access to only a landline at home,” he said.\nDr Yee added that problems may also arise if conversation partners have different preferences of communication. \n“For example, if my co-worker prefers speaking on the phone, they may find my texting or emailing very impersonal, which may lead to inefficiencies in communication,” he said.\nDespite the pitfalls, Dr Yee said he does not view the new forms of communication as problematic.\nNoting his nine-year-old son communicates with his similarly-aged best friend using their parents' phones solely via GIFs (graphics interchange format), Dr Yee said that there are different ways of communicating with each other, in which both parties “negotiate” and find common ground over time.\n“As long as the purposes of communication, such as building relationships and conveying meaning, are satisfactorily achieved, I am not sure if we need to worry too much about it,” he said.\nDr Soon added: “There are pros and cons with every technology use, but behaviours and norms adapt as we go along.”"

            "Article Body": "Each week, TODAY’s long-running Big Read series delves into the trends and issues that matter. This week, we look at the subculture of cyclists who fork out thousands of dollars for high-end bicycles and cycling apparel. This is a shortened version of the full feature, which can be found here.\nSINGAPORE — Although he began cycling using BMX bicycles in his teenage years, Mr Muzzamel Mazidee felt the urge to upgrade to a more expensive model only when he was in his mid-20s.\nThat lightbulb moment arrived in 2019 as he and his friends were cycling on the road, and he found himself unable to catch up with them. While he was riding a commuter bike, they were riding road bikes, which are generally lighter and speedier.\n“The moment I could not catch up, I knew that apart from my fitness, I also was not on the right type of bike,” said the 31-year-old general manager of a technology startup.\nMr Muzzamel decided to go for a S$3,000 bicycle — a mid-range model of the American brand Specialized he had chosen  — as he felt that he would have been tempted to spend more money to frequently upgrade the bike if he were to start with an entry-level range anyway.\nFast forward to May 2023, and he nonetheless upgraded to a bespoke bicycle from Bastion.  \nWith a name like Superleggera and using ultra light carbon fibre material, the top-end model from the Australian brand cost Mr Muzzamel about S$30,000 to put together.\nWhile having a custom-made bicycle means it will be carefully put together taking into account one’s physical measurements to give as comfortable a riding experience as possible, Mr Muzzamel said there was more to the purchase as well.\n“Having a bespoke bike is almost similar to having an art piece,” he said, comparing it to how other people may indulge in other forms of high-value items like watches or cars.\nWhile his willingness to splurge on a two-wheel pedalling machine may raise some eyebrows, Mr Muzzamel is not alone; there are many others like him who burn rubber in groups a few times each week on a tour de Singapore riding high-end bicycles. \nAlthough interest in cycling in general has abated since its peak during the Covid-19 pandemic, the subculture surrounding premium bicycles — which cost upwards of S$5,000 apiece — is still going strong, according to those in the fraternity.\nPremium bikes and their eye-watering price tags recently attracted public attention here again, albeit in a less positive light, after it was reported that a S$7,900 foldable Brompton bicycle was allegedly gifted to former transport minister S Iswaran who is currently facing corruption charges.\nThe same British brand of bikes had previously come under the spotlight when it emerged in 2012 that the National Parks Board had bought 26 of this brand of bicycles at S$2,200 each, leading the public to question whether the agency got value for its purchases.\nThis case also resulted in a former National Parks Board officer to be charged and later fined S$5,000 for lying to auditors about his relationship with a bicycle firm director.\nMore recently, Brompton is also sponsoring for the first time a new race category in the upcoming OCBC Cycle event this year, dubbed the Foldie Ride.\nTo date it is the only adult category race that has been fully subscribed.  \nMr Dean Koh, vice-president for media and publicity at the Singapore Cycling Federation said that “the rise of cycling influencers” is one of two factors that has contributed to the high-end bicycle subculture here.\nThe other factor, he said, is the proliferation of local cycling clubs that keep cyclists “active in their passion” by organising regular group rides.\nBicycles mostly have just two wheels but the price disparity between different brands can be like night and day.\nRoad bikes of the more affordable variety can retail for about S$700 here.\nAt the other end of the price spectrum, a premium bicycle frame alone can cost more than S$10,000, excluding other components such as a groupset (cranks, brakes, derailleurs, gear shifters and so on), wheels, handlebars and saddles that cost in the hundreds or thousands of dollars per part.\nTo complete the look, these cyclists would also splurge on cycling apparel and other accessories that can easily add up to over S$1,000.\nAs it turns out, cyclists and retailers alike said that there are tangible reasons to spend big bucks on their rides.\nMr Desmond Cheong, head of retail at Specialized, said: “If a bike has gone through more research and innovation, there's a performance benefit. And when there's a performance benefit, that’s what you pay for. So that's where the pricing varies.”\nAnother pragmatic reason for buying more famous higher-end bicycles is that they tend to sell better in the resale market than their lesser-known counterparts.\nHowever, as with any products, there are aspirational aspects behind the decision to spend on big-ticket items as well.\nMs Tiffany Lau, a 27-year-old avid cyclist and content creator who currently uses a bicycle sponsored by a local shop that retails for around S$7,000, said: “I have friends who ride S$20,000 bicycles and whenever there’s a new (bicycle) jersey launch, they spend S$1,000 to S$2,000 on buying a new jersey,” she said.\nThis is akin to how other people might splurge on branded bags or watches because they like them, she added.\nWhile Ms Lau noted that a “cheap bike” can still go far, “a lot of times we often go for brands and designs that we like”.\nSo, who are these loyal consumers of high-end gear, attire and even bike customisation services?\nOne term popularised since around the 2010s to describe such cyclists is Mamil — middle-aged men in Lycras. According to most cyclists and retailers, this group still make up a significant number of their consumers.\nBut female riders, and younger riders across genders, are also a growing demographic among avid cyclists over the years.\nMusic educator and avid cyclist Melodie Ng, 35, said: \"I would see three guys to every one lady (per group). I think previously this would have been much less.\"\nWhile cyclists and retailers here agreed that people may cycle to connect for professional reasons — some describing cycling as a “new golf” — they differed on the extent of such a practice, and whether the networking that developed is by design or accident.\nOn top of riding, chilling, chatting and swooning over the newest and shiniest gear together, a growing number of riders are also manifesting their passion for their two-wheelers through content creation.\nOne cyclist who goes by the online moniker Oompa Loompa runs a YouTube channel that features interviews with other bikers and gear reviews. The channel has gathered almost 19,000 subscribers, a “sizeable number” but not enough to “replace a day job”, he said.\nRetailers here noted that some of the local cyclists’ preference towards more premium rides is not too dissimilar from that of other markets.\nMr Cheong of Specialized said that comparing Singapore with other markets, there is no drastic difference in demand for their various tiers of bicycles.\nHowever, anecdotal evidence points to cyclists here having a more upmarket taste in bikes than those in neighbouring countries.\nMs Lau, for example, said that when she goes cycling in Bangkok and meets avid cyclists there, she notices that Singaporean riders tend to have more expensive bikes than their Thai counterparts. \nMr Gary Gleason, vice-president of sales at American mountain bicycle brand Wilderness Trail Bikes, noted that his company serves high-end riders who use upscale accessories in Singapore.\n“It seems that the market is really kind of catered towards a more premium product,” he was reported as saying at the recent Taipei Cycle 2024, Asia’s biggest bicycle trade show.\nWhile those in the fraternity believe that the subculture surrounding premium bikes in Singapore is here to stay — given its resilience throughout the pandemic — some reiterated the importance of not losing sight of the wider cycling populace here, too.\nActive mobility expert Tham Chen Munn, a former vice-president for recreation at the Singapore Cycling Federation, said that while the Lycra-clad road riders with their expensive bicycles may be more prominent, there is also the “unsung, unseen” group of bike users who ride around the neighbourhoods on shared paths.\n“And when the Park Connector Network continues to expand, who does this benefit? It’s the uncles and aunties and families who use these paths, not the road cyclists,” he said. \nMr Koh of the Singapore Cycling Federation added that those who are bitten by the cycling bug but are more budget conscious can always turn to the resale market for good deals or big retailers that offer more affordably priced equipment to get started on the hobby.\nAt the end of the day, Mr Tham reiterated that cycling is still an activity for all and not something reserved for the more affluent.\nAgreeing, Mr David Ho, coordinator of cycling group West Coast Riders, said: “You can still cycle with a low-cost bike, accessories and kits. However, if you want to follow trends, or keep up with the Joneses, then the sky's the limit.\n“The main reasons (for cycling) will still be the same: Fitness, social bonding and adventure.” "

Others also routinely post their adventures via dedicated social media accounts, which are also used by various cycling groups to organise rides and showcase their activities.\nPremium bikes and their eye-watering price tags recently attracted public attention here again, albeit in a less positive light, after it was reported that a S$7,900 foldable Brompton bicycle was allegedly gifted to former transport minister S Iswaran who is currently facing corruption charges.\nThe same British brand of bikes had previously come under the spotlight when it emerged in 2012 that the National Parks Board had bought 26 of this brand of bicycles at S$2,200 each, leading the public to question whether the agency got value for its purchases.\nThis case also resulted in a former National Parks Board officer to be charged and later fined S$5,000 for lying to auditors about his relationship with a bicycle firm director.\nMore recently, Brompton is also sponsoring for the first time a new race category in the upcoming OCBC Cycle event this year, dubbed the Foldie Ride.\nTo date it is the only adult category race that has been fully subscribed.  \nWhat might be less known to those outside the cycling circle is that while S$7,900 or S$2,200 are not small sums, they represent just a fraction of how much some cycling enthusiasts are willing to spend on their hobby.\nIn fact, there are even bicycle wheelsets alone that come with five-figure price tags. Some high-end components such electronic groupsets can also cost over S$5,000.  \nThe reasons for the willingness to pour big money into these bikes vary; from utilitarian ones such as better-build quality and resale value, to intangible ones such as peer influence and sheer passion, according to retailers and cyclists TODAY spoke to. \nBut who exactly are these diehards?\nWhile many of them are mainly middle-aged male professionals with money to spare, over the years more women and younger riders have also entered the fold, said those in the fraternity.\nTheir motivation for spending time and money on this pastime goes beyond the health benefits that naturally come with the activity, cyclists told TODAY.\nThe activity also allows them to expand their social and professional networks, though the cyclists described this as more of an inadvertent benefit.\nStill, they stressed that underneath the occasionally uniformed lycra and pricey equipment — which might look formidable to those outside their circle —  they are a diverse and welcoming group. \nMs Tiffany Lau, a 27-year-old avid cyclist and content creator who currently uses a Basso bicycle sponsored by a local shop that retails for around S$7,000, said:\n“Honestly, my group has higher-end bike riders, too, but they are friendly and would not judge others based on gear.”\nBicycles mostly have just two wheels but the price disparity between different brands can be like night and day.\nFor example, premium folded bikes like Bromptons and Birdys carry a listed retail price of anywhere between S$2,000 and S$8,300, compared to the more mass-market variants that can cost as low as about S$300.\nSimilarly, road bikes of the more affordable variety can retail for about S$700 here.\nAt the other end of the price spectrum, a premium bicycle frame alone can cost more than S$10,000, excluding other components such as a groupset (cranks, brakes, derailleurs, gear shifters and so on), wheels, handlebars and saddles that cost in the hundreds or thousands of dollars per part.\nFor instance, a handlebar from Italian brand Pinarello retails for about S$1,500.\nCostlier bicycles typically use higher-end components. Most are also made of carbon fibre — a strong, lightweight material — as opposed to aluminium for mass consumer bikes.\nHigh-end bicycles can weigh as light as 6.5kg, less than half of mass market ones.    \nNaturally, those who willing to fork out the moolah for such costly machines would typically also splurge on cycling apparel.\nWhile a nondescript cycling jersey can cost under S$30, a branded top from the likes of Pas Normal Studios, Rapha or Maap can easily cost more than 10 times that.\nPrices for helmets, bibs, sunglasses and shoes are no less steep, which means that one can easily spend over S$1,000 to be decked out in branded cycling apparel from head to toe. \nAs it turns out, cyclists and retailers alike said that there are tangible reasons to spend big bucks on their rides.\nMr Desmond Cheong, head of retail at Specialized, said: “If a bike has gone through more research and innovation, there's a performance benefit. And when there's a performance benefit, that’s what you pay for. So that's where the pricing varies.”\nSpecialized offers a broad range of two-wheelers with prices ranging from around S$2,000 for its entry-level offerings to S$20,000 for its highest-end S-Works range.\nAs for the popularity of Bromptons, its managing director for Asia Pacific region Mark Smedley said that it has been driven by “a growing emphasis on sustainable and efficient urban transportation solutions”.\n“This uptrend reflects a shift towards compact and versatile options, aligning with Singapore's focus on eco-friendly mobility initiatives.”\nOn why they appeal better to certain consumers over a more affordable folding bike, Mr Smedley said that while Brompton offers premium products, “it is everything around it that makes our brand special”.\n“As a B Corp we are really driven by our values, our commitment to our customers, our own people, our planet, and our partners to be a business for good,” he said.\nA B Corporation refers to a company that is certified and has voluntarily met the highest standards for social and environmental performance. \nThere are various cycling groups on social media set up by Brompton enthusiasts. These include Brompton_Riders@SG, a Facebook group which has about 15,000 members.\nMr Eugene Lim, an avid Brompton bicycle rider since 2010, said: “Value wise, as the bicycle is very well built and manufactured to last, amortising a good bike over 10 years offers more value than a S$500 bike which will not last more than three years.”\nMr Lim is also a director at Camp High Achievers, a training consultancy firm which has sold Brompton bikes and offered related services such as guided tours since 2020.\nAnother pragmatic reason for buying more famous higher-end bicycles is that they tend to sell better in the resale market than their lesser-known counterparts.\nOLC, a 31-year-old avid cyclist who runs bicycle-focused YouTube channel under the moniker Oompa Loompa, sold his first bicycle and used the proceeds to fund a higher priced bicycle.\nIn picking his second bicycle frame, brand reputation again played on his mind.\n“I know that because of the brand name, people out there will still want to buy it (if I sell it later), as it is a reputable brand. Unlike buying an unknown frame, where the depreciation is much higher,” said OLC, who declined to give his full name as being a mysterious, masked character is part of his YouTube persona.\nHowever, as with any products, there are aspirational aspects behind the decision to spend on big-ticket items as well.\nMs Lau, who works in the aviation industry, spent over S$3,000 on her Giant bicycle and related accessories when she started road cycling two and a half years ago. A significant sum no doubt — but still modest compared to some others.\n“I mean, I have friends who ride S$20,000 bicycles and whenever there’s a new (bicycle) jersey launch, they spend S$1,000 to S$2,000 on buying a new jersey,” she said.\nThis is akin to how other people might splurge on branded bags or watches because they like them, she added.\nWhile Ms Lau noted that a “cheap bike” can still go far, “a lot of times we often go for brands and designs that we like”.\nGiant, founded in Taiwan, is one of the largest producer of bicycles in the world. \nOther popular high end brands here for road bikes would include Trek, Specialized, Cervelo, Canyon, Bianchi, Factor and Pinarello, the Italian brand which is sometimes touted as the Ferrari of bicycles.\nDespite paying a hefty price tag, some cyclists acknowledged that not everyone can feel or benefit from the improved performance that higher-end gear can offer, as it would depend on other fundamentals such as one’s physical stamina and cycling technique.\nOLC, who regularly interviews cyclists for his YouTube channel, said he has come across a number who said that they buy certain bicycle brands as they would like to imitate their favourite athletes, or simply for the brand “prestige or heritage”.\nAnd as some put it, such expensive purchases are just a case of desire meeting spending power.\n“As with any hobby, if one is passionate about it, you'll be willing to spend a significant amount of time and money on it,” said Mr David Ho, coordinator of cycling group West Coast Riders, which welcomes cyclists of varying riding competencies. \n“However, the amount one spends really depends on what you want to achieve out of it, and the affordability (to you).”\nWest Coast Riders has over 3,400 members on Facebook. Between 70 and 150 cyclists would take part in their rides, which happen three times a week.\nIn most cycling groups here such as West Coast Riders, each ride can stretch for anything from 40km to 80km, with cyclists grouped according to their rolling speeds, which can range from 20kmh to nearly 40kmh. \nTODAY reported last year that cycling activities and bicycle sales in general have declined from its Covid-19 peak.\nMr Eric Ng, a professional airbrush artist of 18 years whose shop Paint Extreme does mainly custom artwork for premium bikes, said that the decline is due to “impulsive buyers” leaving the market as other leisure activities opened up after the pandemic.\nMr Azhar Abdullah, Treknology3’s retail, marketing and distribution manager said that the “entry to mid-segment” bikes were the ones that saw the most fluctuation, as these were the bicycles that casual cyclists back then went for.\nTreknology3 is the authorised distributor of bicycles from popular American brand Trek, which produces mass consumer models as well as high-end ones used by professional race cyclists. \nMr Kenneth Tan, co-owner of high-end bike dealer Cycleworx, said that the drop has been so drastic that some shops are selling their stocks at a loss, or closing down entirely.\nIn the past year, cycling as a sport has seen a “market correction” back to pre-pandemic levels, with some signs of gradual growth, retailers told TODAY recently. \nMeanwhile, demand from the more “serious” cyclists who have been investing in gear, has remained largely steady through the years, the retailers said.\nSo, who are these loyal consumers of high-end gear, attire and even bike customisation services?\nOne term popularised since around the 2010s to describe such cyclists is Mamil — middle-aged men in Lycras. According to most cyclists and retailers, this group still make up a significant number of their consumers.\nMr Tan of Cycleworx, a dealer for Pinarellos that typically retail for five-figure sums, said the bulk of his customers are still male professionals, usually in their late 30s and above.\nBut female riders, and younger riders across genders, are also a growing demographic among avid cyclists over the years.\nMusic educator and avid cyclist Melodie Ng said: \"I would see three guys to every one lady (per group). I think previously this would have been much less.\"\nCo-founder of Cycle Project Store, Sherwin Ng, also noted a \"refreshing\" increase in female riders in the otherwise male-dominated scene since the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\"The increase could also be due to social media, better gears designed for women such as apparel, equipment and so on,\" said Mr Ng.\nMr Gino Abano, managing director for Specialized Asiahub, cautioned against presuming a link between having financial means and a willingness to spend.\n“I can think of a number of people, who are not exactly big executives, owning the most expensive bikes. And it’s also true the other way around,” he said.\n“I think it’s less to do with income or profile, and more to do with how interested they are in riding the bike and what they want out of it.”\nMr Azhar of Treknology3 added that the barrier to buying pricier bicycles nowadays is also lower with the availability of easier payment options.\n“We see more people using the instalment option as well. But I will say for us as a business we don't really see a big jump,” he said.\nAs premium bike groups in Singapore attract more followers, is high-end cycling becoming the “new golf” here?\nThe concept of networking on wheels —  bandied around since at least the 2010s —  refers to individuals using cycling as a means to extend their professional networks, given that people who can afford to splurge on leisurely activities are likely to be well-heeled or established in their careers.\nWhile cyclists and retailers here agreed that people may cycle to connect for professional reasons, they differed on the extent of such a practice, and whether the networking that developed is by design or accident.\nMr Ng of Paint Extreme described high-end bike cycling as a “second golf”, as it offers potential opportunities to mingle with high-profile professionals or business leaders.\nCompared to signing up for a country club membership, or partaking in other activities that the rich may indulge in like driving luxury cars, buying a performance bike is something more accessible to even “those with just above average income”, he added.\nStill, others said that the majority who commit to cycling do it for the company and the joy of the activity. Networking, if it does happen, occurs inadvertently, they added.\nMr Tan of Cycleworx said those who deliberately join cycling groups for the sake of networking tend to stand out from cyclists who are actually passionate about the sport, and tend to number \"just one or two\" in a group.\n\"They also usually don't last long,\" added Mr Tan, a former SEA Games medallist in the late 1980s to mid 1990s.\nMr Muzzamel said that even though he sees high net worth individuals in his group, he cycles first and foremost “to get away from work”.\nAs he expects that other professionals also feel the same about cycling, he refrains from talking shop with them.\nHowever, he also acknowledged that if one were to mix among the right group of people, you are “bound to” to meet with certain people that they can potentially find certain business dealings with. This applies to cycling or any social group.\nRiders said that going cycling is no different from other forms of hanging out with friends — except that this particular group of people share a common interest in bicycles.\nStill, some of those interviewed noted that there are groups which project a more “elitist”  image than others, given their preference for certain expensive brands and their penchant for posting Instagrammable photos and videos on social media showing their gear, group rides as well as gatherings at hip cafes.\nMusic educator Melodie Ng noted that bike brands also organise rides limited to cyclists who own those brands, which she reckoned was for photography and promotional purposes.\nHowever, cyclists interviewed noted that even such cycling groups affiliated to particular brands organise specific “social nights” or rides that are open to people who do not use their gears.\nRegardless, forming smaller passionate groups around certain brands is not exclusive to just cycling, they said — no different from photographers using the same camera brand going for photo walks together or convoys of motorbikes of the same brand riding together.\nMembership growth happens organically, and any form of screening, if at all, is for practical and safety purposes, said the cyclists.\nFor example, Ms Ng said the first group that she joined four and a half years ago was organised by the shop she had bought her bicycle from.\nFrom there, joining another group is typically done by introduction through friends.\n“Safety is actually quite a concern when it comes to riding with people that you don't know. So generally, we (the group) would make sure that this person has some kind of experience riding before allowing them to join us,” said the 35-year-old who is a member of the cycling group called No Pressure Pressure Club.\nOn top of riding, chilling, chatting and swooning over the newest and shiniest gear together, a growing number of riders are also manifesting their passion for their two-wheelers through content creation.\nOLC, Ms Lau and Ms Ng have all been uploading cycling-related contents on their various social media platforms.\nOLC’s Oompa Loompa YouTube channel that features interviews with other bikers and gear reviews, has gathered almost 19,000 subscribers, a “sizeable number” but not enough to “replace a day job”, he said.\nFor Ms Ng, while she started road cycling a few years ago upon the recommendation of an ex-colleague to try the sport, she has “become like a (content) creator of sorts”.\n“Not everyone obviously does it that way. It just happens to be what I'm interested in, I love making videos,” said Ms Ng, who has 4,700 followers on Instagram.\nMs Lau has about 9,000 followers on her tiffylauonwheels Instagram account.\nMr Dean Koh, vice-president for media and publicity at the Singapore Cycling Federation said that “the rise of cycling influencers” is one of two factors that has contributed to the high-end bicycle subculture here.\nThe other factor, he said, is the proliferation of local cycling clubs that keep cyclists “active in their passion” by organising regular group rides.\nRetailers here noted that some of the local cyclists’ preference towards more premium rides is not too dissimilar from that of other markets.\nMr Cheong of Specialized said that comparing Singapore with other markets, there is no drastic difference in demand for their various tiers of bicycles.\nHowever, anecdotal evidence points to cyclists here having a more upmarket taste in bikes than those in neighbouring countries.\nMs Lau, for example, said that when she goes cycling in Bangkok and meets avid cyclists there, she notices that Singaporean riders tend to have more expensive bikes than their Thai counterparts. \nMr Gary Gleason, vice-president of sales at American mountain bicycle brand Wilderness Trail Bikes, noted that his company serves high-end riders who use upscale accessories in Singapore.\n“It seems that the market is really kind of catered towards a more premium product,” he was reported as saying at the recent Taipei Cycle 2024, Asia’s biggest bicycle trade show.\nMr Ng of Cycle Project Store added: \"The cycling community here in the Southeast Asian region are fast paced with their consumption of products and generally after the newest or latest release as compared to certain part of the world.\"\nWhile those in the fraternity believe that the subculture surrounding premium bikes in Singapore is here to stay — given its resilience throughout the pandemic — some reiterated the importance of not losing sight of the wider cycling populace here, too.\nActive mobility expert Tham Chen Munn, a former vice-president for recreation at the Singapore Cycling Federation, said that while the Lycra-clad road riders with their expensive bicycles may be more prominent, there is also the “unsung, unseen” group of bike users who ride around the neighbourhoods on shared paths.\n“And when the Park Connector Network continues to expand, who does this benefit? It’s the uncles and aunties and families who use these paths, not the road cyclists,” he said. \nMr Koh of SCF added that those who are bitten by the cycling bug but are more budget conscious, can always turn to the resale market for good deals or big retailers that offer more affordably priced equipment to get started on the hobby.\nAt the end of the day, Mr Tham reiterated that cycling is still an activity for all and not something reserved for the more affluent.\nAgreeing, Mr Ho of West Coast Riders said: “You can still cycle with a low- cost bike, accessories and kits. However, if you want to follow trends, or keep up with the Joneses, then the sky's the limit.\n“The main reasons (for cycling) will still be the same: Fitness, social bonding and adventure.” "

            "Article Summary": "Foreign domestic workers in Singapore have lately taken to pawning gold jewellery bought on instalment plans with zero upfront payment .\nThis helps them obtain much-needed cash, but high interest rates charged by jewellery shops often mean workers cannot repay monies owed and end up in debt.\nSome of these helpers also borrow from both legal and illegal moneylenders, with maid agencies and charities saying they have seen a rise in cases of maids taking loans and getting into debts.\nForeign domestic worker interviewed by TODAY said that familial pressures on them to send a big portion of their salaries home, coupled with the occasional family emergency, often force them to borrow money.\nThese helpers, employers, maid agencies, charities and MPs whom TODAY spoke to offered various suggestions on how to better address the longstanding problem",
            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — Two freak accidents involving her brother and nephew on an island north of Manila late last year turned a Filipino domestic helper’s life upside down. The 45-year-old, who has worked in Singapore since 1999, had to find a way to raise around 85,000 pesos (S$2,000) to pay for their surgery and hospitalisation bills.\nHaving previously borrowed S$5,000 from her employer which she later returned, Ms Melissa (not her real name) did not want to make yet another hefty loan request.\nSo she borrowed various sums of money from four different friends and a licensed moneylender from the Philippines, all of whom charged her an interest for their loans.\nFor months, sleep was hard to come by, she said. “I just keep thinking (about) how to pay back all these people.”\nShe briefly considered turning to local moneylenders to do so, but was intimidated by horror stories from myriad peers who said they would do “bad things” to foreign domestic workers who did not repay their debts on time.\nMs Melissa thus decided to roll the dice, quite literally, by turning to online gambling sites. But Lady Luck was disinterested in her prayers, and her financial woes worsened, all the while without her employer knowing. \nShe lost more than S$5,000 over four months.\n“I don’t want to gamble anymore. It was very difficult, very stressful,” she said. She spoke to TODAY on condition of anonymity for fear of getting into trouble with her employer.\nHelp eventually came in the form of her aunt, also a foreign domestic worker in Singapore, who lent her S$3,000 to pay off all monies owed.\nWith all her debt now consolidated to just her aunt, she said she feels significantly more at ease, and is focused on repaying her debt in the coming months.\nMs Monette, 41, another helper who did not want to give her last name for fear of reprisal from her current employer, went through a similar situation in 2018.\nShe borrowed S$500 from a licensed moneylender in Singapore to pay for her mother’s hospital bills back in Manila and struggled to repay her debt. So she borrowed from another moneylender, and then another.\nMs Monette ended up owing money to six different moneylenders, including one loan shark.\nBoth Ms Monette and Ms Melissa told TODAY that they know of many fellow maids who are in similar situations — facing piling debts that could spell the end of their working stint in Singapore.\nThis is because foreign domestic workers are prohibited from borrowing from unlicensed moneylenders, and will be liable to have their work permits revoked and barred from future employment in the country if they do so, according to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM). \nEmployers upset with their domestic helpers for getting into debt, or those harassed by moneylenders and fear for their safety, also tend to repatriate them.\nUnfortunately, this precarious financial situation that many foreign domestic workers find themselves in is not new.\nIn 2019, a study commissioned by information services company Experian and Hong Kong charity Enrich found that a third of foreign domestic workers in Singapore were in debt.\nThat same year, the Government revealed that there had been a sharp rise in foreigners borrowing from licensed moneylenders from 2016 to 2018.\nIn 2016, 7,500 foreigners borrowed from licensed moneylenders. The figure jumped more than seven-fold to 55,000 in 2018, with a further 53,000 borrowing from licensed moneylenders in the first half of 2019 alone. \nTo curb the spike, the Ministry of Law introduced a slew of measures in 2019, including a loan cap for low-income foreigners — limiting the combined amount they can borrow across all moneylenders to just S$500.\nThese measures appear to have worked.\nThe number of foreign domestic workers borrowing from licensed moneylenders had “increased but remains low at about 150 borrowers per year” from 2020 to 2022, MOM said in response to a parliamentary question by Member of Parliament (MP) Seah Kian Peng in February 2023.\nThe ministry also noted, however, that the number of foreign domestic workers borrowing from unlicensed moneylenders was estimated by the Singapore Police Force to be “in the hundreds”, and that the figure had been increasing from 2020 to 2022.\nThe measures meant to restrict foreign domestic helpers from borrowing from licensed moneylenders might have inadvertently led them to find other ways of obtaining money they desperately need, some welfare organisations told TODAY.\nIndeed, such ways include buying gold jewellery via instalments without any upfront payment at some stores in malls such as Lucky Plaza, then pawning them immediately for a sum of cash, as reported recently by TODAY. \nMs Cyndelene Miranda, a 48-year-old Filipino who has been a domestic worker in Singapore for 13 years, said that around a third of her friends have struggled to pay back what they owe these jewellery shops in instalments, due to the high interest rates charged.\nFor instance, one store charges about S$100 in interest for every gram of gold — so a worker would have to pay S$300 for an item containing 3g of gold on top of its selling price.\nMs Miranda added that she and her peers also often receive messages via WhatsApp from unknown numbers offering to loan them money; with some maids taking up those offers in desperation.\nWith over 280,000 foreign domestic workers in Singapore today, concerns abound whether society is doing enough to help this vulnerable group of workers.\nTODAY looks at the factors that lead these foreign domestic workers into debt, why this concerns society at large and what can be done to solve this persistent problem. \nWhile there have not been any updated statistics on how many foreign domestic workers are in debt since 2019, several charities and maid employment agencies told TODAY that they have seen a rise in complaints from employers about their maids borrowing from unlicensed moneylenders, including loan sharks.\nOne such charity, Blessed Grace Social Services, said that the debt situation “has not improved” in recent years. foreign domestic workers seek help from the charity for their financial troubles every week, and there are around 50 who are currently in debt, it said.\nMr Edmund Pooh, general manager of Universal Employment Agency, said it has also noticed an uptick in foreign domestic workers either borrowing or acting as guarantors for money borrowed legally and illegally.\nThe agency would normally receive one or two complaints from employers in a year, Mr Pooh said, but that had gone up to five or six in 2023.\nThis increase in borrowing was corroborated by spokespeople from the Humanitarian Organization for Migration Economics (Home) and the Association of Employment Agencies (AEAS) as well.\nHowever, the Foreign Domestic Worker Association for Social Support and Training (Fast), a charity supported by MOM, said it had not seen a significant change in the number of cases it dealt with regarding debt.\nBlessed Grace added that it has seen a rise in cases of foreign domestic workers owing money to retail shops — including stores selling jewellery in Lucky Plaza — which charge “unreasonably exorbitant” interest rates on their products too.\n“The late interest charges sometimes even end up becoming greater than the principal sum, so it becomes an endless cycle of repayment since the late interest charges continue to run. This is also known as a debt trap,” the charity said.\nSitting alongside the struggles that domestic helpers face when they end up in debt is the tricky predicament that employers find themselves in as well.\nMr Joseph Ong, whose helper of 10 years was saddled with around S$1,000 in debt this year, said that she was often “distracted and looking troubled” because of it. Mr Ong, who is in his 40s, ended up paying her outstanding payments.\nFor hairdresser Rachelle Foo and her family, their former domestic helper of 14 years would often ask Ms Foo’s parents for four to six months’ worth of salary in advance, and borrow sums of money from her and her siblings too.\nMs Foo said that the maid would spend her days crying at home when she was short of money, which the latter said was because of family emergencies back home in Indonesia.\n“We hired her mainly to look after our grandma, who is 106 years old, just in case anything happens when we are out at work,” she said.\n“Our main concern was whether she could focus on her work, and whether her money problems would be recurring … There’s only so much we can help (financially).”\nRegrettably, despite the family consistently providing loans when she needed them, their helper eventually resorted to stealing their jewellery and cash in 2023 — which Ms Foo called a “traumatic” experience as they had regarded her as part of the household. \nTheir former helper was sentenced to 14 months’ jail last Thursday (March 21). \nEmployers may also end up being harassed or even threatened by loan sharks for repayment of their maids’ debts, which can leave them feeling unsafe and vulnerable.\nIn such cases, they typically have to bear the costs to send their domestic helper home and hire a replacement.\nIn addition to limiting the amount that low-income foreigners (who earn less than S$10,000 a year) can borrow to S$500, the Ministry of Law implemented other measures in 2019 to prohibit licensed moneylenders from targeting these workers in their advertisements.\nStarting Aug 16 of that year, they are not allowed to lend to more than 300 foreigners and up to S$150,000 in total loans to foreigners at any one time.\nTo complement these enforcements, the MOM said in 2023 that it has been working closely with various stakeholders to educate migrant workers, including foreign domestic workers, on “prudent financial management practices and the risks and implications of borrowing money”.\nThis is done through the mandatory Settling-In-Programme for all first-time foreign domestic workers, guidebooks like the Money Management Guide for Migrant Domestic Workers, regular newsletters, and by educating employers to advise their foreign domestic workers to stay away from unlicensed moneylenders.\nThe ministry also has a dedicated TikTok account for foreign domestic workers, “Friends_SgMDW”, which posts videos in domestic helpers’ native languages to warn them about scams and offer avenues where they can reach out for help if they face financial troubles.\nSeveral of their videos have even racked up over two million views. \nAdditionally, around 300 member agencies of the AEAS — which the association says handles about 70 per cent of all foreign domestic workers placed in Singapore — remind workers not to borrow money through illegal means as part of their “orientation checklist”.\nSo why do agencies and charities still see an increasing number of domestic workers in deep financial water?\nAs licensed moneylenders have existing quotas on how many foreigners they can loan to, they tend not to be willing to lend to low-income foreign domestic workers, said Blessed Grace.\n“Hence, with no legal avenues for the foreign domestic workers to borrow from, they resort to borrowing from unlicensed moneylenders, retail companies/shops, and handphone or jewellery shops.”\nSocial media applications like Facebook and TikTok also provide an easy avenue for exploitative businesses and illegal moneylenders to reach foreign domestic workers, and this has exacerbated the problem, said Mr Jeffrey Wong, founder of JForce Employment Agency.\nAnother key factor is the influence of fellow foreign domestic workers.\nAEAS president K Jayaprema said that “peer relationships” are often more persuasive than the words of caution given by organisations.\n“When a friend tells another friend: ‘Don't worry, this is okay, I've done this’ — you will just listen,\" she said.\n“The advice from MOM, the association, or the agency which deploys them at the beginning — how would this stay in somebody's mind, who is at that point, in a desperate need of money?”\nMr Wong from JForce agreed, saying: “No matter how much we teach them, I can’t fight with their friends because they are with them (so often) — on Facebook Messenger, TikTok, forums… (They think) since everyone is doing that, why not me?”\nAnother key reason why foreign domestic workers sink into debt is the outsized responsibility some of them bear in caring for extended family back home, some of whom see these workers as an easy source of financial help given the perception that they are earning good money in Singapore.\nForeign domestic workers typically earn anything from S$500 to just over S$1,000 a month depending on their nationality and experience, according to agencies that TODAY spoke to. \nFor domestic helpers who come from Myanmar, the country’s political instability amid the Covid-19 pandemic in recent years is another factor why they feel a financial strain.\nMs Yoon Wai Wai Khin, a 31-year-old domestic helper, used to earn a monthly salary of S$500 in 2021 and would send nearly all of her earnings back home to Bago each month, occasionally leaving her with just S$10 in the bank.\nHer father, the other breadwinner in her family who drives for a living, was unable to work due to the Myanmar government’s restrictions, and Ms Yoon was forced to borrow money from her employer to help her family of five survive.\nThe picture painted by Ms Yoon of the familial pressure to give almost everything they have to their loved ones is a familiar one to foreign domestic workers, regardless of their nationality.\n“The main reason (for being in debt) is our family needs in the Philippines,” said a 33-year-old domestic helper from Nueva Ecija, who wanted to be known only as Ms Jane.\nShe had borrowed from a total of five different moneylenders and a loan shark to pay for her son’s hospital bills in 2018 after her employer rejected her request for a salary advance.\nNot being able to repay her debts, she was repeatedly harassed by moneylenders through text messages which contained many “nasty words”.\nBut Ms Jane felt that she did not have any other choice back then.\n“We want to support them even though we don’t have anything here. We try our best to give them what we have, without even realising that we are the ones who fall into trouble,” she said.\nBoth Ms Jane and Ms Monette managed to find support with Blessed Grace Social Services, which enrolled them in a “debt consolidation programme” where a third-party company helped to pay off their existing loans.\nForeign domestic workers under this programme would then be able to repay monies owed to just one party, as opposed to many, on a more manageable schedule.\nReflecting on what they went through over five years ago, both women said that they have learned to turn down their family’s requests when they do not have the means to help, even if it is tough to do so.\n“We have very strong family ties. Even my nephews, I have to (pay to) send them to school. I have to help my sister’s family, my brother’s family. That’s our culture. Even if they don’t ask for money, we will give,” said Ms Monette.\nShe added: “Now if I don’t have money, I say no… I’m very thankful that I don’t have debt (now), and I have money for emergencies, something to take out from my bank.\n“As much as possible, we want our fellow domestic helpers to learn financial literacy… and that it’s okay to say no if we don’t have (money) — we cannot give everything.”\nSuch anecdotes from foreign domestic workers, which almost always outline familial pressures to send large portions of their salary home, are indicative of just how financially vulnerable these domestic helpers are.\nThe occasional family emergency further adds to their susceptibility of getting into debt or being preyed upon by businesses. \nIt is important to address the root cause of why foreign domestic workers are getting into debts, said Assistant Professor of Sociology Shannon Ang from Nanyang Technological University, as Singapore has an obligation to care for the well-being of migrant workers who contribute substantially to society.\nOn what more can be done to tackle the issue of maids getting into debts, foreign domestic workers, employers, maid agencies, charities and MPs whom TODAY spoke to offered various suggestions.  \nMP for Yio Chu Kang Single Member Constituency Yip Hon Weng said that the Government \"should do more\" during the interviews that the Centre for Domestic Employees conducts for new workers, as it is an avenue for them to open up about their monetary concerns privately without their employers present, and to provide them with some form of financial counselling.\nMr Yip had posed a parliamentary question in May 2021 to then Manpower Minister Josephine Teo on how to ensure foreign domestic workers would be able \"to honestly share their concerns\", to which Ms Teo responded in writing that the centre would \"endeavour to create a safe environment\" and that it aimed to conduct all interviews in foreign domestic workers' native languages to ensure they are understood.\nSuch a safe environment should extend to the home as well, said migrant workers' rights group Transient Workers Count Too.\nPreventing foreign domestic workers from getting into debts \"starts at home through a culture of open communication and understanding, so that our helpers feel comfortable sharing their problems, which we may potentially be able to help with before they resort to risky solutions,\" it said. \nAgreeing, Asst Prof Ang believes that society needs to find ways to enable foreign domestic workers to speak up “more freely” about their conditions, needs, difficulties and aspirations — “all without the fear of facing reprisal”.\nFor Ms Monette, Ms Melissa, Ms Yoon and many foreign domestic workers, inculcating a culture of responsible spending through financial literacy could be key to preventing foreign domestic workers from falling into a vicious cycle of debts.\nBut educating these helpers in Singapore is just one piece of the puzzle.\n“Education will help in the long run, but it does not resolve their immediate need to put food on the table back home,” said Mr Ong, the employer, who works in finance.\n“I think providing an avenue for foreign domestic workers to access short-term, micro loans through government programmes and non-profit organisations will help. Right now, the only options available to foreign domestic workers are exploitative and prey on their desperation.”\nAgreeing, the charity Blessed Grace believes having legal avenues for money lending will prevent foreign domestic workers from falling victim to abuse and exploitation.\nMs Foo, the other employer, suggested that it should be mandatory for employers’ consent to be sought if a foreign domestic worker wishes to make certain high value financial transactions like obtaining loans from licensed moneylenders, pawning jewellery, or buying items on instalment plans.\n“Now, they can do so as long as they have their work permit. But these (transactions are mostly) behind the employer’s back,” she said, adding that employers would have to bear the consequences should things go south.\nIn addition to recruitment agencies' existing efforts to remind foreign domestic workers not to borrow, regular workshops on managing debt and unlicensed moneylending could also be conducted for domestic helpers as these agencies are often the workers' first point of contact, said the MOM-supported charity Fast. \nIt also encourages employers to regularly check in with foreign domestic workers on their financial situation, educate them about the dangers of unlicensed moneylending and refer them to organisations like Fast should they require advice on debt management. \nUltimately, in order for society to propose constructive solutions to foreign domestic workers' debt problems, Asst Prof Ang of NTU said there should be more publicly available data to “comprehensively understand their current situation and how it might change in the future”.\nMOM had previously released three runs of the Migrant Domestic Worker and Migrant Domestic Worker Employer Study (in 2010, 2015-16, and 2021), which aims to offer insights into the employment experiences of foreign domestic workers in Singapore, and their awareness of their employment rights and responsibilities.\nIts most recent study in 2021 found that over 99 per cent of foreign domestic workers surveyed were satisfied with working and living in Singapore, and would recommend their family and friends to work here as a domestic helper. The figure was 97 per cent in 2015.\nBut Asst Prof Ang noted that the study’s findings “do not allow us to properly study relationships between issues like verbal/physical abuse, privacy, mental well-being, and other employment conditions”.\n“Allowing more independent parties to study the migrant workforce, whether through sharing of data or through facilitating access to the population, will provide insight into why they may engage in certain practices and allow us to better address them,” he said."

            "Article Body": "Each week, TODAY’s long-running Big Read series delves into the trends and issues that matter. This week, we look at the factors behind the longstanding issue of foreign domestic workers mired in debt, and what can be done to solve this persistent problem. This is a shortened version of the full feature, which can be found here.\nSINGAPORE — Two freak accidents involving her brother and nephew on an island north of Manila late last year turned a Filipino domestic helper’s life upside down. The 45-year-old, who has worked in Singapore since 1999, had to find a way to raise around 85,000 pesos (S$2,000) to pay for their surgery and hospitalisation bills.\nHaving previously borrowed S$5,000 from her employer which she later returned, Ms Melissa (not her real name) did not want to make yet another hefty loan request.\nSo she borrowed various sums of money from four different friends and a licensed moneylender from the Philippines, all of whom charged her an interest for their loans.\nFor months, sleep was hard to come by, she said. “I just keep thinking (about) how to pay back all these people.”\nShe briefly considered turning to local moneylenders to do so, but was intimidated by horror stories from myriad peers who said they would do “bad things” to foreign domestic workers who did not pay back their debts on time.\nMs Melissa thus decided to roll the dice, quite literally, by turning to online gambling sites. But Lady Luck was disinterested in her prayers, and Ms Melissa’s financial woes worsened, all the while without her employer knowing. \nShe lost more than S$5,000 over four months.\n“I don’t want to gamble anymore. It was very difficult, very stressful,” she said. She spoke to TODAY on condition of anonymity for fear of getting into trouble with her employer.\nMs Monette, 41, another helper who did not want to give her last name for fear of reprisal from her current employer, went through a similar situation in 2018.\nShe borrowed S$500 from a licensed moneylender in Singapore to pay for her mother’s hospital bills back in Manila and struggled to repay her debt. So she borrowed from another moneylender, and then another.\nMs Monette ended up owing money to six different moneylenders, including one loan shark.\nUnfortunately, this precarious financial situation that many foreign domestic workers among the 280,000 here find themselves in is neither uncommon nor new.\nIn 2019, a study commissioned by information services company Experian and Hong Kong charity Enrich found that a third of foreign domestic workers in Singapore were in debt.\nThat same year, the Government revealed that there had been a seven-fold jump in foreigners borrowing from licensed moneylenders from 2016 to 2018.\nTo curb the spike, the Ministry of Law introduced a slew of measures in 2019 including a loan cap for low-income foreigners — limiting the combined amount they can borrow across all moneylenders to just S$500.\nWhile the authorities said in 2023 that the number of foreign domestic workers borrowing from licensed moneylenders had “increased but remains low at about 150 borrowers per year” from 2020 to 2022, those borrowing from unlicensed moneylenders was estimated by the Singapore Police Force to be “in the hundreds”, and the figure had been increasing.\nCharities and maid agencies told TODAY that the overall debt situation for maids “has not improved”, and the measures meant to restrict foreign domestic workers from borrowing from licensed moneylenders might have inadvertently led these workers to find other ways of obtaining money they desperately need.\nOne such charity, Blessed Grace Social Services, said foreign domestic workers seek help from the charity for their financial troubles every week, and there are around 50 who are currently in debt, it said.\nThis increase in borrowing by maids was corroborated by spokespeople from migrant advocacy group Humanitarian Organization for Migration Economics and the Association of Employment Agencies (AEAS) as well.\nBlessed Grace added that it has seen a rise in cases of foreign domestic workers owing money to retail shops which charge “unreasonably exorbitant” interest rates on their products too. \nAs TODAY recently reported, these include jewellery stores such as those in Lucky Plaza which allow foreign domestic workers to buy gold jewellery via instalments without any upfront payment.\n“The late interest charges sometimes even end up becoming greater than the principal sum, so it becomes an endless cycle of repayment since the late interest charges continue to run. This is also known as a debt trap,” the charity said.\nOther measures implemented by the Ministry of Law in 2019 include prohibiting licensed moneylenders from targeting low-income foreigners in their advertisements, and restrictions on how many foreigners they can loan money to at any one time.\nTo complement these enforcements, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said in 2023 that it has been working closely with various stakeholders to educate migrant workers, including foreign domestic workers, on “prudent financial management practices and the risks and implications of borrowing money”.\nSo why do agencies and charities still see an increasing number of domestic workers in deep financial water?\nAs licensed moneylenders have existing quotas on how many foreigners they can loan to, they tend not to be willing to lend to low-income foreign domestic workers, said Blessed Grace.\n“Hence, with no legal avenues for the foreign domestic workers to borrow from, they resort to borrowing from unlicensed moneylenders, retail companies/shops, and handphone or jewellery shops.”\nSocial media applications like Facebook and TikTok also provide an easy avenue for exploitative businesses and illegal moneylenders to reach foreign domestic workers, and this has exacerbated the problem, said Mr Jeffrey Wong, founder of JForce Employment Agency.\nAnother key factor is the influence of fellow maids.\nAEAS president K Jayaprema said that “peer relationships” are often more persuasive than the words of caution given by organisations.\n \n“When a friend tells another friend: ‘Don't worry, this is okay, I've done this’ — you will just listen,\" she said.\n“The advice from MOM, the association, or the agency which deploys them at the beginning — how would this stay in somebody's mind, who is at that point, in a desperate need of money?”\nAnother key factor resulting in maids sinking into debt is the outsized responsibility some of them bear in caring for extended family back home who see these workers as an easy source of financial help given the perception that they are earning good money in Singapore.\nCrucially, foreign domestic workers, who typically earn anywhere from S$500 to just over S$1,000 a month depending on their nationality and experience, often feel the pressure to cede to these requests.\n“We have very strong family ties. Even my nephews, I have to (pay to) send them to school. I have to help my sister’s family, my brother’s family. That’s our culture. Even if they don’t ask for money, we will give,” said Ms Monette the foreign domestic helper. \nSuch anecdotes from foreign domestic workers, which almost always outline familial pressures to send large portions of their salary home, are indicative of just how financially vulnerable these domestic helpers are.\nIt is therefore important to address the root cause of why foreign domestic workers are getting into debts, said Assistant Professor of Sociology Shannon Ang from Nanyang Technological University, as Singapore has an obligation to care for the well-being of migrant workers who contribute substantially to society.\nHe said that there should be more publicly available data to allow more independent parties to study the migrant workforce and provide insight into why they may engage in certain practices.\nOn what more can be done to tackle the issue of maids getting into debts, foreign domestic workers, employers, maid agencies, charities and Members of Parliament (MPs) whom TODAY spoke to offered various suggestions.\nMP for Yio Chu Kang Single Member Constituency Yip Hon Weng said that the Government \"should do more\" during the interviews that the Centre for Domestic Employees conducts for new workers, as it is an avenue for them to open up about their monetary concerns privately without their employers present, and to provide them with some form of financial counselling.\nSuch a safe environment should extend to the home as well, said migrant workers' rights group Transient Workers Count Too.\nPreventing foreign domestic workers from getting into debts \"starts at home through a culture of open communication and understanding, so that our helpers feel comfortable sharing their problems, which we may potentially be able to help with before they resort to risky solutions,\" it said. \nAgreeing, Asst Prof Ang believes that society needs to find ways to enable foreign domestic workers to speak up “more freely” about their conditions, needs, difficulties and aspirations — “all without the fear of facing reprisal”.\nFor Ms Monette, Ms Melissa, Ms Yoon and many others, inculcating a culture of responsible spending through financial literacy could be key to preventing foreign domestic workers from falling into a vicious circle of debts.\nBut educating these helpers in Singapore is just one piece of the puzzle.\n“Education will help in the long run, but it does not resolve their immediate need to put food on the table back home,” said Mr Ong, the employer, who works in finance.\n“I think providing an avenue for foreign domestic workers to access short-term, micro loans through government programmes and non-profit organisations will help.

            "Article Body": "Each week, TODAY’s long-running Big Read series delves into the trends and issues that matter. This week, we look at the move to make home hospitalisation a mainstream service in public healthcare. This is a shortened version of the full feature, which can be found here.\nSINGAPORE — Ever since the stringent no-visitor rule in hospitals was temporarily imposed at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, Mr Paul Osmond George, 46, who has ischemic heart disease and cardiomyopathy, has had a phobia of being hospitalised. \nIn January, when an upper respiratory tract infection caused a huge fluid build-up in Mr George's body, leading to coughing and vomiting, his cardiologist at Sengkang General Hospital (SKH) advised hospitalisation for a more effective diuretic medication treatment.  \nHowever, given Mr George’s aversion to hospitals, he immediately took up his doctor’s offer — with “no second thoughts or worries” — to recover at home under the Mobile Inpatient Care-at-Home (MIC@Home) pilot, aimed at making “virtual wards” a viable alternative to traditional hospital care. \nWhile virtual wards may still be a novelty for many Singaporeans, they are not new — similar models have been widely adopted overseas. \nVirtual wards were first piloted in England in 2005 and have since been further scaled up by the country's National Health Service, with more than 10,000 virtual beds available. \nIn Australia, the concept has been taken further with the setting up of a standalone virtual hospital in Adelaide.\nSpeaking in Parliament on March 6 during a debate on his ministry's budget, Minister for Health Ong Ye Kung announced that from April 1, the MIC@Home service will become \"mainstream\" and be offered as part of public hospitals’ regular services.\nThis follows a successful two-year MIC@Home pilot the Ministry of Health launched in April 2022 as part of ongoing efforts to future-proof the healthcare system in a rapidly ageing Singapore.\nThe pilot was an extension of the Covid-19 Virtual Ward programme launched in September 2021 to free up bed capacity in Singapore's Covid-19 wards for the more seriously ill when Singapore experienced a spike in coronavirus cases. \nMr Ong said the rationale behind making MIC@Home mainstream is so that Singapore is not trapped in the mindset of “building hospitals” when thinking about expanding healthcare capacity.  \n“There is potential to better anchor care outside of hospitals and in the community,” said Mr Ong, adding that not all patients require “high-acuity care” and constant monitoring in a hospital throughout their treatment course.\nIn his parliamentary speech, Mr Ong also said that MIC@Home is not set to cost more than a regular hospital stay, and might be projected to cost the same or less. \nMIC@Home offers eligible patients with certain conditions — such as skin infections, urinary tract infections, and congestive heart failure with fluid overload — the option of being cared for in the comfort of their own homes instead of a hospital ward.\nOther hospitals that currently offer MIC@Home are Changi General Hospital (CGH), Singapore General Hospital (SGH), Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH), and hospitals under National University Health System (NUHS).\nCurrently, there are 104 MIC@Home virtual beds across all these hospitals. \nIn response to TODAY's queries, MOH said it aims to provide up to 300 MIC@Home virtual beds this year in light of the move to make it a mainstream service.\nIn turn, public hospitals here told TODAY they are in the process of ramping up resources, though they all declined to provide specific figures.\nPatients under MIC@Home are generally loaned monitoring devices, namely blood pressure monitoring sets, thermometers, and pulse oximeters. \nHealthcare workers can monitor patients via a dashboard that contains all the pertinent information on their conditions. \nJust like a normal hospital ward, a specialist consultant is in charge of every patient admitted to the programme.\nThe consultants work with a team of junior doctors, nurses, therapists, and administrative staff to ensure each patient gets the care and support they need round the clock.\nDoctors and nurses on the MIC@Home teams do not have any duties in the ward and are solely focused on teleconsultations and home visits.\nThey communicate with patients and their families using messaging platforms such as Telegram, WhatsApp, and phone calls.\nNew mum Fatin Farzana Miswan, 31, decided to make use of the MIC@Home scheme after her baby had jaundice just five days after birth in February. \nAs a first-time parent, the geologist was fraught with anxiety, given her baby’s tender age and the arrangements she and her husband would have to make to visit the child in hospital.\n“I'll be thinking and worrying about what is happening to my daughter,” said Ms Farzana, “We also don't have a car, so I think it'd be quite difficult for us to commute back and forth to the hospital.” \nSetting up a “virtual ward” in her home was a seamless process for Ms Farzana.\nThe phototherapy machine was delivered to her flat, before KKH nurses came to advise her on how long to administer phototherapy treatment, and how to take her baby's vital signs and record them on an app.  \nBeing connected to the nurses through a WhatsApp group also eased her worries, especially when she had questions about her daughter's care. \nWhile the MIC@Home programme allows patients to recover in the comfort of their homes, the knock-on effect of this arrangement is also keenly felt by their caregivers. \nMr Adrian Tiam, a 53-year-old private hire driver, felt reassured having his daughter Charlotte recuperate at home in February after she was diagnosed with dengue fever and required hospitalisation due to a dangerously low platelet count of 50,000 per ml. \nPlatelets help to clot a person’s blood and prevent excessive bleeding. When the platelet count is low, one may have trouble stopping bleeding.  \nSince normal platelet counts are between 150,000 and 450,000 per ml.\nWhen Charlotte, 16, and Mr Tiam went to CGH, they had to wait 12 hours before she finally got a bed close to midnight and was warded for one night.  \n“I felt nervous and uneasy in a new environment as I had to sleep in the hospital overnight,” said Charlotte.\nThe student was “quite happy” to be told by the CGH@Home team later that while her platelet count was still low, she would be eligible for the pilot programme to recover from home. \n“I definitely felt well taken care of, as the nurses and doctor would call me if I didn’t take my blood pressure readings at my normal times,” said Charlotte.  \nMr Tiam said having Charlotte recover at home meant he and his wife could watch over her “24 hours a day”, and did not have to make special arrangements with their work to accommodate the hospital’s visiting hours.\nDoctors and healthcare professionals say that there are many benefits to making the MIC@Home service mainstream, besides freeing up healthcare capacity in hospitals.\nFor one thing, patients recover better at home, where a familiar environment results in them eating and sleeping better, which aids in their recovery.\nWhile patients are recommended to take up MIC@Home, it is still presented as an option and they can decline it at any time. \nSGH@Home's lead, Dr Michelle Tan, said that some patients have declined to be part of MIC@Home as they are more familiar with receiving medical treatment in the hospital.\n“This will require a mindset change in patients and their caregivers to accept this new model,” Dr Tan said.\nOther reasons patients do not take up MIC@Home include the lack of caregiving support at home or if if their home environment is not suitable for the service. \nIndeed, while patients and their caregivers who participated in MIC@Home have praised the initiative, some people remain sceptical. \nOne of them is Mr Hayden Ng, 33, who has not been hospitalised in recent months. But he would still not choose to recover at home if given the option even though he believes MIC@Home is a good initiative to lessen the load for hospitals.\nThe social media manager said that since he is single and lives with his elderly mother, having him recover at home “doesn’t seem like a good idea”.   \nHe is not sure that she can cope with the “extra stress and responsibilities needed” for being his caregiver if he chooses MIC@Home.\n“At the same time, I’d prefer to be near the healthcare staff in case my condition suddenly worsens,” said Mr Ng. “This would give me more peace of mind.”\nExperts said that in order for MIC@Home to achieve mainstream success, public perceptions of traditional care need to change. \nAssistant Professor Ian Ang, from Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore, said: “The public has to be convinced with data and evidence that such a new care model will not compromise their recovery, and also have an open mindset for this paradigm shift in the evolving forms of healthcare in Singapore with the times.”\nStill, some doctors are more sanguine about the move to make home hospitalisations a norm.\n“People usually think you have to be in a hospital to get treatments like intravenous drips under a doctor's watchful eye,” said Dr Stephanie Ko, a consultant at the division of advanced internal medicine at NUHS and lead of NUHS@Home.\n“But we have shown that it is not only possible but that it is also safe and works well, changing how people think about home-based care.”"

            "Article Body": "Each week, TODAY’s long-running Big Read series delves into the trends and issues that matter. This week, we look at a proposed move by the authorities to publicise litterbugs’ images, and its effectiveness in tackling a worsening littering situation here. This is a shortened version of the full feature, which can be found here.\nSINGAPORE — Redhill resident John Posko Amalaraj would sometimes return home to an eyesore — discarded leftover drink cartons in the lifts at his Housing Development Board (HDB) block.\nOutside of the lifts, the 67-year-old also worries that stagnant water left to collect in strewn litter in the open could lead to mosquitos breeding, and contribute to a rise in dengue cases.\n“Compared to last time, the littering is too much — particularly when you see inside the lift,” said the senior customer service captain at the Downtown Line, adding that he had raised his concerns with his Member of Parliament (MP).\nEven though notices were quickly put up at lift lobbies to remind residents not to litter, the problem persists, said Mr Amalaraj.\nOver at Jalan Besar, Ms Wendy Chan, a resident at a condominium along Somme Road, told TODAY that she often sees cigarette butts being littered at the property’s front gate and in its flower pots.\n“(Some passers-by) love to think that plant pots are little dustbins for them.”\nAs her condominium is next to a public park, birds frequent the area and may sometimes leave droppings on cars that are parked along the main road in front of the property, said the swimming coach in her 50s.\nSome car owners would clean these droppings on their vehicles with tissues, before dumping the used tissues on the road outside the condominium, she added.\nEstate cleaner Abdul Rahim — who oversees three HDB blocks near Haig Road Market and Food Centre, including its nearby playground and garden — said: “Sometimes you finish (cleaning in the morning) already, after that you come around 12 something or 1 something (in the afternoon), and they throw the wrappers (on the ground) again.”\nThe 65-year-old said some commonly littered items include leftover food, wrappers, or paper.\nSenior Parliamentary Secretary for the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) Baey Yam Keng said in Parliament on Monday (March 4) that the authorities had seen an increase of 15 per cent in the number of feedback on ground littering from 2022 to 2023, compared to the two years before the Covid-19 pandemic.\nLast October, the National Environment Agency (NEA) said in its annual report that the number of people caught littering rose between 2021 and 2022. \nIn 2022, the authorities issued more than 20,000 tickets for littering, a 42 per cent increase from the roughly 14,000 tickets issued in 2021.\nResponding to TODAY’s queries, NEA disclosed that it issued 18,600 tickets for ground littering in 2023.\nCurrently, those who litter may face a composition fine of S$300 for a first offence, while offenders convicted in court may be issued a fine and sentenced to perform a Corrective Work Order (CWO).\nExperts interviewed by TODAY cited the lack of a sense of ownership, and hence shared responsibility over caring for a public space, as one reason littering is on the rise in Singapore despite years of enhanced enforcement measures.\nA 2020 survey by the Singapore Management University on public satisfaction with the country’s cleanliness also found that many Singaporeans think it is the cleaners’ job to keep the city litter-free.\nFaced with the rise in littering cases, Mr Baey told Parliament that MSE would thus adopt a “more targeted approach” to tackling littering hot spots.\nThe ministry will conduct around five times as many enforcement blitzes in 2024 compared to 2023, from 21 last year to more than 100 this year.\nNEA would also quadruple its deployment of closed-circuit television cameras (CCTVs) at littering hot spots, which include HDB estates, to around 1,000. The statutory board under MSE would work with community stakeholders to identify these offenders.\nIn the event that there are still no leads, NEA would explore putting up images of these offenders at the places where they had littered, to seek the wider community’s assistance in identifying them, said Mr Baey.\nCleaners, experts and MPs whom TODAY interviewed said that turning to surveillance and closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras could be effective, to some extent, in deterring litterbugs.\nMr Rahim, the estate cleaner, said he noticed the littering situation improved after NEA officers started ramping up enforcement and issuing more “saman” (Malay for “fines”) to offenders.\nDr Everold Hosein, a senior communication advisor-consultant for the World Health Organization and Unicef, who previously contributed to a 2011 sociological study on littering in Singapore, said the study found that the mere “appearance of enforcement” decreased littering.\n“By that we mean having public health inspectors in a bright uniform just walking around littering hot spots seem to deter littering. They don’t have to issue any tickets… they just have to walk around!”\nDr Serene Koh, director of consultancy firm Behavioural Insights Team Singapore, added that research on enforcement and compliance has shown that the certainty of getting caught is a more effective deterrent than the severity of the punishment.\n“If I know I can get away with it, I will take my chances even if the fine is high,” she said of people's mindset.\nHowever, there is also a limit to how effective surveillance cameras can be.\nMs Joan Pereira, an MP for Tanjong Pagar Group Representation Constituency, said: “It is also not easy to identify offenders because they are aware of camera spots and it is not possible to cover every single spot with cameras.”\nAnd even those who support the move recognise that the line between official surveillance and citizen vigilantism is a fine one to tread — making it necessary for safeguards to be put in place.\nMs Pereira said that as it stands, some residents are already submitting photos — of neighbours or people in the community whom they have seen littering — to the authorities.\nAsked if she is concerned that publicising offenders’ images might eventually lead Singaporeans down the slippery slope of “endorsing” vigilante behaviour, Ms Pereira added: “That is certainly one of the potential issues, but that is also why a robust investigation is still required to establish the facts and culpability of any alleged culprits.”\nAgreeing, 29-year-old consultant Darren Then said that while publicising a litterbugs' photos could be “quite useful”, ensuring that the facts are well-established before putting up such images would be crucial.\n“We don’t want any instances of accidental littering that is not on purpose (to be published) — and then they (offenders) become public enemy number one,” said Mr Then.\nShould the plan to publicise offenders’ images be implemented, experts called on the authorities to proceed with care and consideration.\nDr Koh said: “If it feels like the Government is identifying these offenders for minor littering offences, there will be pushback from the public that the Government is making a mountain out of a molehill, or people’s reputations are unnecessarily harmed for a seemingly ‘small’ offence.”\nTo avoid this, she suggested applying a set of transparent and strict criteria before resorting to publicly identifying the offenders, so that Singaporeans understand that it is not a decision that is taken lightly. \n“This might (also) go some way towards discouraging (vigilantism)… because people will know that they can’t just name-and-shame anyone. Just as the Government chooses carefully who to identify, this will role-model to them that they must also first establish facts before calling people out.”\nShe added that the criteria can be based on the severity of the action — such as in the case of high-rise littering, or the frequent disposal of trash in an inappropriate manner that thus attracts rats — or the persistence of the offence, such as litterbugs who remain recalcitrant despite multiple engagements by the authorities.\nUnlike Dr Koh, Mr Damien Huang, a public policy consultant and associate faculty at the Singapore University of Social Sciences, suggested possibly keeping the criteria undisclosed to prevent the public from possibly trying to “game” it.\nTo prevent the “victimisation and scapegoating” of vulnerable groups, such as children and seniors who “may not even realise they are committing an offence”, Mr Huang said the Government should also consider aspects of equitability if and when enforcing the measure.\n“For children and those who are underaged by law, they should treated more leniently,” he added.\nNEA has said that “care will be exercised” in cases committed by young children, the elderly or vulnerable groups.\nUltimately, experts told TODAY that a punitive approach, while necessary and effective, must also be accompanied by preventive measures and persistent public education.\nThey also suggested that instead of relying on the wider community’s assistance to identify offenders, it could be worthwhile to urge a “different kind of community involvement” — where people actively remind others who may have unintentionally littered, instead of being preoccupied with snapping a picture the moment bad behaviour is detected.\nDr Hosein said: “I would urge an ongoing — not sporadic — campaign of each of us helping each other do the right thing... A gentle reminder from another might be nice, to get me to pick (accidental litter) up and properly dispose of it.\n“I don’t think we have to go to the extent of public name-and shame. This would increase resentment rather than foster the community sense of citizens helping each other out to be better citizens.” \nJoo Chiat resident Rashid Khalifa said that publicising litterbugs' photos may be effective against repeated offenders, but he does not think it will make a society a kinder place in the long run. \nWondering aloud whether punishment is the only way to deter people and get them to behave better, the 43-year-old business owner added: “I don’t want to live in a society where I think people are always trying to look out for others’ faults.”"

            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — Redhill resident John Posko Amalaraj would sometimes return home to an eyesore — discarded leftover drink cartons in the lifts at his Housing Development Board (HDB) block.\nOutside of the lifts, the 67-year-old also worries that stagnant water left to collect in strewn litter in the open could lead to mosquitos breeding, and contribute to a rise in dengue cases.\n“Compared to last time, the littering is too much — particularly inside the lift,” said the senior customer service captain at the Downtown Line, adding that he had raised his concerns with his Member of Parliament (MP).\nEven though notices were quickly put up at lift lobbies to remind residents not to litter, the problem persists, said Mr Amalaraj.\nSimilarly, a housewife in the nearby Lengkok Bahru neighbourhood who wanted to be known only as Madam Ng, said that while she does not think that the litter situation is worsening, she has noticed an increase in the number of rodents in the area.\nThe 58-year-old said: “I’ve seen many rats around recently. Last time, it was not so bad. In fact, I didn’t really see (rats) until maybe the last year or so.”\nOver at Jalan Besar, Ms Wendy Chan, a resident at a condominium along Somme Road, told TODAY that she often sees cigarette butts being littered at the property’s front gate and in its flower pots.\n“(Some passers-by) love to think that plant pots are little dustbins for them.”\nAs her condominium is next to a public park, birds frequent the area and may sometimes leave droppings on cars that are parked along the main road in front of the property, said the swimming coach in her 50s.\nSome car owners would clean these droppings on their vehicles with tissues, before dumping the used tissues on the road outside the condominium, she added.\nSuch antisocial acts continue despite the Government’s perennial anti-littering campaign.\nSenior Parliamentary Secretary for the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) Baey Yam Keng said in Parliament on Monday (March 4) that the authorities had seen an increase of 15 per cent in feedback on ground littering from 2022 to 2023, compared to the two years before the Covid-19 pandemic.\nLast October, the National Environment Agency (NEA) said in its annual report that the number of people caught littering rose between 2021 and 2022. \nIn 2022, the authorities issued more than 20,000 tickets for littering, a 42 per cent increase from the roughly 14,000 tickets issued in 2021.\nResponding to TODAY’s queries, NEA disclosed that it issued 18,600 tickets for ground littering in 2023.\nCurrently, those who litter may face a composition fine of S$300 for a first offence, while offenders convicted in court may be issued a fine and sentenced to perform a Corrective Work Order (CWO).\nCWO — introduced in 1992 — requires recalcitrant offenders to clean public areas for a minimum of three hours, up to a maximum of 12 hours. The regime serves to remind them of the impact of littering and the difficulties faced by cleaners, said NEA.\nIn 2019, NEA also revamped the design of its CWO vest to a luminous pink and yellow in a bid to “raise the visibility of the CWO” and increase its deterrence effect. \nIt also introduced CWO sessions in city areas such as Chinatown and Tanjong Pagar in November 2022 to, as NEA put it, increase the public visibility of such sessions, and “further drive home the impact of littering”.\nStill, complaints about littering have continued to rise despite these penalties and the authorities’ enhanced enforcement efforts over the years.\nMr Baey told Parliament that MSE would thus adopt a “more targeted approach” to tackling littering hot spots.\nThe ministry will conduct around five times as many enforcement blitzes in 2024 compared to 2023, from 21 last year to more than 100 this year.\nRecalcitrant littering offenders would carry out CWO in areas with high footfall, such as transport nodes and town centres — like Causeway Point in Woodlands — as well as at city locations such as the Somerset area, he added.\nNEA would also quadruple its deployment of closed-circuit television cameras (CCTVs) at littering hot spots, which include HDB estates, to around 1,000. The agency would work with community stakeholders to identify these offenders.\nIn the event that there are still no leads, NEA would explore putting up images of these offenders at the places where they had littered, to seek the wider community’s assistance in identifying them, said Mr Baey.\nAlthough the need to keep the island clean has been drummed into generations of Singaporeans since their schooldays, the state of cleanliness and hygiene in several housing estates remains very much a work in progress, MPs told TODAY.\nMr Liang Eng Hwa, MP for Bukit Panjang Single Member Constituency, said he receives feedback from residents on littering and sanitation concerns “quite often”.\nHe noted that the situation “has remained the same” over the years, and it is “not a state that we desire”.\nMs Joan Pereira, MP for Tanjong Pagar Group Representation Constituency (GRC), said that the town council received about 340 cases of feedback on littering and refuse last year for the Henderson-Dawson ward she oversees.\nIt has received 65 such feedback so far this year, she said. The residents’ concerns are often about ground littering and littering within lift cars — and they typically either request for cleaners to clean the place or to provide information about alleged perpetrators.\nWhile there has been a “slight improvement” over the past year, Ms Pereira said there are “definitely areas that can be improved on further”. \n“While we have targeted measures for places with higher incidence of littering offences, it is not possible just to rely on ramping up the cleaning frequencies.\n“We really need every resident to play their part and not litter.”\nMs Gheetha Mahalangam, whose son and family live at the Skyville @ Dawson HDB cluster in Queenstown, often visits the sky gardens in the block of flats with her granddaughter when she pays them a visit.\nWhile they enjoy playing and exercising together amid the greenery, the 64-year-old retiree noted that the littering problem at the sky gardens can be “horrible”. Visitors would often leave behind biscuit packets, chip packets, used masks, and even leftover food. \n“After eating, even though there is a bin, they just throw it here,” she said, adding that the litter problem is not for lack of waste disposal infrastructure as the bins at the sky garden are usually not full.\nMs Chan, the Jalan Besar resident, agreed: “It’s not so much that the bins are overflowing. Actually there are bins at the park… At the most, it’s a 30-second walk. It’s (almost) like people, when they want to throw litter, they want the dustbin right next to them.”\nExperts interviewed by TODAY cited the lack of a sense of ownership, and hence shared responsibility over caring for a public space, as one reason littering is on the rise in Singapore despite years of enhanced enforcement measures.\n“I think there’s a sense (among people) that any space outside of the home is not mine to care about and therefore not my responsibility to manage,” said Dr Serene Koh, director of consultancy firm Behavioural Insights Team Singapore.\nAgreeing, Associate Professor Tan Ern Ser, a sociologist at the National University of Singapore (NUS), said that when it comes to anti-littering measures, the “best outcome is to have people who would feel a sense of ownership of public spaces and possess a strong motivation to keep them clean”.\nThis would help residents internalise the positive messaging to love their environment — which includes maintaining the cleanliness of public spaces — rather than focusing on “not messing up” the environment or refraining from littering simply due to fears of punitive measures, he added.\nAssoc Prof Tan also suggested that the increase in littering offences could be a post-Covid-19 effect, corresponding to the general rise in human traffic.\nMany Singaporeans also think it is the cleaners’ job to keep the city litter-free.\nA 2020 survey by the Singapore Management University on public satisfaction with the country’s cleanliness found that over 90 per cent of respondents believed the authorities should demand higher standards of cleaning contractors to make sure bins were cleared promptly. \nMore than eight in 10 (86 per cent) also said they expected cleaners to clear the trash throughout the day to prevent the bins from overflowing, the same study found.\nAcknowledging this, Mr Baey said in his presentation of his ministry’s budget: “Based on our cleanliness surveys, many still believe that the responsibility to keep Singapore clean lies with the Government and our ‘army of cleaners’.\n“Our cleaners are already busy cleaning up natural litter such as fallen leaves and accidental litter such as the spillages. Let us not add to their heavy workload with intentional litter by leaving or throwing our litter for them to clean up after us.” \nEstate cleaners told TODAY that they sweep the litter in their estates throughout their shifts, which run from 7am to 4pm or 5pm, and also clear the bins twice a day.\nAn estate cleaner, who declined to be named, said he understands if residents throw their trash outside of the bins if they were full. However, there are also instances where residents litter beside or near the bins, even when the trash cans are not full.\nAnother cleaner, Mr Abdul Rahim — who oversees three HDB blocks near Haig Road Market and Food Centre, including its nearby playground and garden — said: “Sometimes you finish (cleaning in the morning) already, after that you come around 12 something or 1 something (in the afternoon), and they throw the wrappers (on the ground) again.”\nThe 65-year-old said some items commonly littered include leftover food, wrappers, or paper.\nSingapore has always made being a clean and green nation a key priority, starting from its early days under then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. \nMost recently, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu announced on Monday (March 4) that the authorities would designate 2024 as the “Year of Public Hygiene”, with targeted measures to further enhance the city-state’s cleanliness.\nHere’s a look at some milestones in Singapore’s journey to elevate its standards of public hygiene over the years:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs litterbugs continue to be a social menace, many MPs, such as Bukit Panjang’s Mr Liang, have called for stronger measures to deal with the offenders.\nOn what are the biggest challenge he faces in overcoming littering offences in his constituency, Mr Liang told TODAY: “The deterrence effect remains low, and the current surveillance and enforcement regime has still not yielded enough results.\n“The key to reducing littering is effective enforcement and strong investigative capabilities, as litterbugs must feel that they have a high chance of being caught and punished,” he added.\nIndeed, cleaners, experts and other MPs whom TODAY interviewed said that turning to surveillance and closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras could be effective, to some extent, in deterring litterbugs.\nMP for West Coast GRC Ang Wei Neng recounted to TODAY that when he moved to oversee the Nanyang division of his constituency in 2021, he received a lot of feedback from residents about people drinking alcohol, smoking, and littering at the void decks and roof gardens of HDB flats in the area.\nTo tackle the issue, Mr Ang worked with the town council to install mobile CCTV cameras at these hot spots.\n“The CCTV images helped us to better coordinate with police and NEA to take enforcement actions,” said Mr Ang, adding that the number of similar feedback received has since “reduced significantly”.\n“Once in a while, we still receive similar feedback at other HDB void decks without mobile CCTV (cameras). We then install the mobile CCTVs at these new locations to deter littering.”\nMr Rahim, the estate cleaner, also said he noticed that the littering situation improved after NEA officers started ramping up enforcement and issuing more “saman” (Malay for “fines”) to offenders.\nDr Everold Hosein, a senior communication advisor-consultant for the World Health Organization and Unicef, who previously contributed to a 2011 sociological study on littering in Singapore, noted that the study found that the mere “appearance of enforcement” decreased littering.\n“By that we mean having public health inspectors in a bright uniform just walking around littering hot spots seems to deter littering. They don’t have to issue any tickets… they just have to walk around!”\nDr Koh of Behavioural Insights Team added that research on enforcement and compliance has shown that the certainty of getting caught is a more effective deterrent than the severity of the punishment.\n“If I know I can get away with it, I will take my chances even if the fine is high,” she said of people's mindset.\nHowever, there is also a limit to how effective surveillance cameras can be.\nMs Pereira, the Tanjong Pagar GRC MP, said: “It is also not easy to identify offenders because they are aware of camera spots and it is not possible to cover every single spot with cameras.”\nMr Ang of West Coast GRC also said that challenges arise when his team is unable to identify the culprits, even with the CCTV images on hand. \nHence, the MSE’s suggestion that it may explore publicising offenders’ images — only when the authorities are unable to identify the culprits — is a good one, said Mr Ang.\n“By sharing such images, we could deter other people from littering, and get the community to identify the culprit to facilitate enforcement.”\nStill, even those who support the move recognise that the line between official surveillance and citizen vigilantism is a fine one to tread — making it necessary for safeguards to be put in place.\nMr Ang stressed that the town council will only share the images of CCTV recordings with government agencies, and never with the public.\nIn his ward, the team also removed the mobile CCTV cameras from locations where the occurrence of littering had dropped. \nMs Pereira said that as it stands, some residents are already submitting to her and the authorities photos of neighbours or people in the community whom they have seen littering.\nAsked if she is concerned that publicising offenders’ images might eventually lead Singaporeans down the slippery slope of “endorsing” vigilante behaviour, Ms Pereira added: “That is certainly one of the potential issues, but that is also why a robust investigation is still required to establish the facts and culpability of any alleged culprits.”\nAgreeing, 29-year-old consultant Darren Then said that while such a measure could be “quite useful”, ensuring that the facts are well-established before putting up such images would be crucial.\n“We don’t want any instances of accidental littering that is not on purpose (to be published) — and then they (offenders) become public enemy number one,” said Mr Then.\nStill, some residents expressed confidence that the relevant authorities will conduct due diligence before making public the images of alleged offenders.\nMs Chan, the Jalan Besar resident, said: “The authorities are the ones that are going to put the images up, so I think the authorities would view the CCTV first… and identify whether it is really a case of littering or just an accident.”\nThe element of shame inherent in some punitive measures — such as the CWO with its prominent vests and high visibility in locations with high footfall, and MSE’s possible publicising of offenders’ images — can be a strong disincentive for prospective offenders, said those interviewed. \nMs Pereira said: “I think such a measure should be effective in targeting certain groups of offenders as a deterrent, given the potential embarrassment from being ‘publicly shamed’ for doing something so unsavoury and inconsiderate, as well as a higher chance of being prosecuted.”\nAssoc Prof Tan from NUS added that for “people who care about their public image, (a shame-based punitive measure) can be an effective deterrence”.\nThose who were previously issued CWOs told TODAY that the shame one may feel while serving their penalty could deter them from re-offending, though its effectiveness differs from individual to individual.\nMr Ryan Tan still remembers his CWO stint though it happened almost five years ago.\nThe 36-year-old founder of content studio Overkill said that he was caught littering his cigarette butt outside a hotel while on location for a shoot.\nMr Tan served about three hours for his CWO session outside Jurong Regional Library.\n“It was an effective punishment for sure,” said Mr Tan, adding that he also quit smoking altogether.\n“I’m very much cautious (now). I (would) rather just throw the rubbish in my pockets if I can’t find a dustbin.”\nThe additional exposure — given that he is a semi-public figure — made the penalty “doubly more effective”, said the YouTube personality who had co-founded the now-defunct local production company Night Owl Cinematics, which produced video series such as the popular Food King vlogs.\nAnother person who was issued a CWO about a decade ago for throwing her cigarette butts near a bush said age could be a factor in whether one feels embarrassed by it.\n“If you ask me, a 30-year-old working professional to do that, I’d be very ashamed. But a lot of offenders are youths in their early 20s or even in their late teens and… I don’t think they're so deterred by the shame of having to serve CWO. Most of them probably think it’s funny — at least that’s what I thought,” said the 31-year-old, who works in commodities.\nStill, loss of face aside, experts noted that the CWO may also be effective for other reasons, such as the time, effort, and trouble the session involved. \nDr Koh said: “Offenders might be wearing the coloured vests but unless people recognise them personally and know who they are, or there are legions of bystanders staring at them and judging them, I don’t actually think the shame dimension is very high. \n“Honestly, I think it’s the effort and trouble it represents. Offenders have to take time out of their day to serve CWO and it’s troublesome. I suspect people who are deterred by CWO want to avoid the effort, rather than avoid the shame.”\nAgreeing, the 31-year-old who had previously served a CWO said the order did deter her from further littering as she did not want to go through the hassle of serving it again.\nRegardless, experts cautioned against using shame-based punitive measures indiscriminately, given their potential pitfalls.\nFor one thing, shame — when harnessed to its extreme — can lead to a loss of self-esteem and reputation, cause undue distress in some, and may even lead individuals to withdraw from the community. \n“If the misbehaviour warrants these consequences, then shame-based punishments may have a role to play in our justice system. But it needs to be wielded thoughtfully and delicately,” said Dr Koh. \n“If it’s persistent and deliberate high-rise littering, then I think there is room for some element of shame-based punishment. But if someone is caught unconsciously dropping a plastic bag at the park, shaming them feels disproportionate to the (mis)behaviour.\n“Using shame is a delicate thing and the authorities should not be indiscriminate about it. Not all littering behaviours are the same.”\nMr Damien Huang, a public policy consultant and associate faculty at the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS), said that always taking the “stick” approach can also be a cause of why scams impersonating officials could be more prevalent in Singapore than in other countries. \nShould the new measure be implemented, he added, “could we see a new scam of ‘Dear XX, you were caught on CCTV dropping a piece of tissue in your neighbourhood. Please pay a fine of S$500 to prevent your photo from being pasted at your lift lobby.’?”\nOn Monday, Mr Baey said that NEA would work closely with the community to identify littering offenders, and would “explore” putting up their images only if there are still no leads.\nShould the plan to publicise offenders’ images be implemented, experts called on the authorities to proceed with great care and consideration.\nDr Koh said: “If it feels like the Government is identifying these offenders for minor littering offences, there will be pushback from the public that the Government is making a mountain out of a molehill, or people’s reputations are unnecessarily harmed for a seemingly ‘small’ offence.”\nTo avoid this, she suggested applying a set of transparent and strict criteria before resorting to publicly identifying the offenders, so that Singaporeans understand that it is not a decision that is taken lightly. \n“This might (also) go some way towards discouraging (vigilantism)… because people will know that they can’t just name-and-shame anyone. Just as the Government chooses carefully who to identify, this will role-model to them that they must also first establish facts before calling people out.”\nShe added that the criteria can be based on the severity of the action — such as in the case of high-rise littering, or the frequent disposal of trash in an inappropriate manner that thus attracts rats — or the persistence of the offence, such as litterbugs who remain recalcitrant despite multiple engagements by the authorities.\nUnlike Dr Koh, Mr Huang of SUSS suggested possibly keeping the criteria undisclosed to prevent the public from possibly trying to “game” it.\nTo prevent the “victimisation and scapegoating” of vulnerable groups, such as children and seniors who “may not even realise they are committing an offence”, Mr Huang said the Government should also consider aspects of equitability if and when enforcing the measure.\n“For children and those who are underaged by law, they should treated more leniently. We may underestimate the psychological and psycho-social effects this may have on their mental-wellbeing as non-matured individuals,” he added.\nNEA has said that “care will be exercised” in cases committed by young children, the elderly or vulnerable groups.\nUltimately, experts told TODAY that a punitive approach, while necessary and effective, must also be accompanied by preventive measures and persistent public education.\nTo achieve behavioural results, Dr Hosein said that there must be a mix of preventive and punitive measures, with a “heavy dose of continued, persistent public education and persuasive communication”.\n“If what has been done so far only focused primarily on punitive measures, then that is probably not productive. Ongoing public persuasion is needed,” he added.\n“If we wish to inculcate an anti-littering sensibility in the culture, we need to begin in preschool, from age two onwards.”\nExperts and residents also suggested that instead of relying on the wider community’s assistance to identify offenders, it could be worthwhile to urge a “different kind of community involvement” — where people actively remind others who may have unintentionally littered, instead of being preoccupied with snapping a picture the moment bad behaviour is detected.\nMr Terrence He, a 39-year-old human resource professional who lives in Marine Parade, said: “Everybody should be a vigilante in the sense of ‘eh, you didn’t pick this up’ rather than you take (a photo) from 10m away… and send in to the authorities.”\nAgreeing, Dr Hosein said: “I would urge an ongoing — not sporadic — campaign of each of us helping each other do the right thing... A gentle reminder from another might be nice, to get me to pick (accidental litter) up and properly dispose of it.\n“I don’t think we have to go to the extent of public name-and shame. This would increase resentment rather than foster the community sense of citizens helping each other out to be better citizens. \nJoo Chiat resident Rashid Khalifa said that publicising litterbugs’ photos may be effective against repeated offenders, but he does not think it will make a society a kinder place in the long run.” \nWondering aloud whether punishment is the only way to deter people and get them to behave better, the 43-year-old business owner added: “I don’t want to live in a society where I think people are always trying to look out for others’ faults.”"

This is a shortened version of the full feature, which can be found here.\nSINGAPORE — Despite having a successful sales career, a workplace with supportive colleagues, and a stable relationship in Malaysia, Ms Anna Chin still felt something was missing.\nAnd so, like many of her fellow compatriots with big dreams, the Malaysian started considering looking southwards: Singapore. \n“I got hold of an opportunity from a recruiter, which made me contemplate whether moving to Singapore would be a good decision. \n“Since Singapore and Malaysia have similar cultures, food, and languages, I thought it would be nice to have the opportunity to work overseas but in a place that doesn’t feel too different from home,” the Ipoh native told TODAY. \nMs Chin, who holds a bachelor’s degree in science, thought she could benefit from the regional experience. She had expected to stay in Singapore for just a few years and then head home. \nFast forward to six years later, the 33-year-old medical sales executive is now a Singapore permanent resident, happily married to a Singaporean, and is in the market for a flat as her forever home here. \nConsidering how her life had taken an unexpected turn since she uprooted herself, Ms Chin said she plans to have children and settle down in Singapore for good. \nMs Chin’s experience will surely resonate with the Malaysian diaspora residing and working in Singapore.\nLast year, Malaysia's then Human Resources Minister V Sivakumar, said that as of 2022, 1.13 million out of 1.86 million Malaysians who migrated abroad were living in Singapore. \nWhile Singapore alone absorbs over 60 per cent of Malaysia’s diaspora, most of the remainder reside in countries located on the other side of the world, such as the United Kingdom and the United States. \nA Malaysia governmental study conducted in 2022 and released on Feb 19 this year revealed that more than half of the Malaysian diaspora in Singapore have tertiary-level qualifications. \nNearly three in four, or 74 per cent, are skilled and semi-skilled workers. \nOn career planning, 62 per cent of the Malaysian diaspora in Singapore polled said they would continue working abroad, while the remainder voted for “no” or “not sure”. \nThe study also found that most Malaysians tend to work in Singapore for at least three years, with 33.2 per cent staying for three to five years. \nA media statement released by the Malaysian authorities about the study warned of the “adverse effects” of the brain drain as skilled workers leave the country.\nThe study was conducted by the Department of Statistics Malaysia, an agency under the Prime Minister’s Department, and the Ministry of Economy. \nRecruitment agencies told TODAY that there is high demand in manufacturing, engineering, hospitality, healthcare and education sectors for Malaysian workers, as Singapore employers grapple with rising costs and manpower shortage. \n“Malaysian candidates are often considered the next-best alternative to other nationalities due to the culture and language, which are the closest to Singapore,\" said Mr Jim Wee, director of Singapore-based recruitment firm Nala Employment.\nSingapore employers TODAY spoke to echoed these sentiments.\nMr Keith Tan, founder and chief executive officer of Crown Digital, a tech startup behind Singapore’s first robot barista Ella, said he had difficulties hiring locally due to the limited talent pool and high labour cost.\nSo he chose to hire from Malaysia. \n“A fresh graduate from NTU (Nanyang Technology University) demanded a pay of S$6,500. The high labour cost in Singapore makes business operations unsustainable, as workers often seek substantial pay increases after a year,” he said.\n“I am looking to Malaysia because of a larger talent pool that does not come at a ‘premium’ cost... The top graduates are very similar to Singapore. (We speak the) same language, and we are neighbours,” he said.\nWith Singapore being the preferred work destination for Malaysians looking to work abroad, Malaysia's chief statistician Mohd Uzir Mahidin said in his statement accompanying the government study that Malaysia needs to reframe the narrative around brain drain by turning it into \"brain circulation\".\n“This shift in perspective means that the Malaysian diaspora will eventually return to Malaysia after a predetermined period, thereby contributing their acquired expertise and experiences back to the country,” he said.  \nHe said the brain drain issue is bound to have an adverse financial effect, especially considering a significant portion of those employed abroad had received their education in Malaysia. \nMalaysia and Singapore economists whom TODAY spoke to said that Malaysia’s brain drain has not reached a dire level yet, but the effects would still be felt in the long term. If left unchecked, the continuous loss of talent would eventually hamper economic growth. \nSunway University economics professor Yeah Kim Leng said the outflow to Singapore had not adversely affected the labour market supply, as the country's manpower needs are still being met. \nHe also said that Malaysia’s current “brain drain” may not be as bad as those experienced during the 1970s and 1980s due to its labour surplus.\n“It is nevertheless concerning as the outflow of talents could dent the country’s structural upgrading to a higher value, innovation-driven and knowledge-based economy.”  \n“In the longer term, the loss of talents could hamper the country’s aspiration to be an advanced and high-income nation,” said Dr Yeah, who is one of the five advisers to Malaysia’s Ministry of Finance.\nAssociate Professor Alwyn Lim, from the Singapore Management University, echoed Dr Yeah’s sentiments, saying that Malaysia’s population is “large enough” to mitigate any economic impact from migrating skilled workers. \nMalaysia has an estimated population of 33.7 million, compared with Singapore’s 5.92 million. \nHowever, he noted that the economic contributions of nearly a million Malaysian workers are not insignificant. \n“Many workers in Malaysia can perform lower-skilled work, so the more concerning trend would be higher-skilled Malaysians who choose to work in Singapore, or elsewhere, whose skills cannot be easily replaced and whose value contributions to the economy may be higher. \n“Higher-skilled Malaysian migration will probably continue to increase, and this will be a limitation for those domestic sectors in Malaysia that rely on the value contribution of higher-skilled Malaysians,” he said. \nWhile Singapore seems to be reaping the economic benefits from Malaysia’s flow of skilled and semi-skilled talent into the country, economists also told TODAY that not everything would be rosy in the long run as the two will need each other to do well in order to thrive. \nAssociate Professor Walter Theseira from the Singapore University of Social Sciences said that with Malaysia's and Singapore's economies closely intertwined, the success of one economy often mirrors the success of the other. \n“Take, for instance, firms headquartered in Singapore that conduct operations in Malaysia. A weak Malaysian economy could directly impact their profitability.” \nSimilarly, Mr Song Seng Wun, an economic adviser at financial service provider CGS International, said that due to the strong intra-regional trade in the Asean region and Singapore's heavy reliance on external trade, any external shock would quickly impact its economy.\n“Currently, regional growth is resulting in higher-income jobs, increased disposable income, and greater demand for services. This growth fosters intra-regional trade and spillover effects,” he said. \n“To Singapore, it is especially important. We want everyone to do well, so they can spend a few hundred dollars here to go to the Taylor Swift concert, for example.” \nWith all that has been said and done about Malaysia’s brain drain, the question remains: What will it take for the Malaysian diaspora to feel incentivised to return home and contribute to their country’s economy? \nAudit associate Phua Jia Herl, 25, who has worked in Singapore for almost two years, said Malaysia must first fix its political issues as political stability would attract more foreign investments. More can also be done to invest in infrastructure. \nAdditionally, Mr Jonathan Lim, a 27-year-old engineer working in Singapore, said there is a need for the authorities to invest not only in infrastructure but also in public services and amenities to improve the overall quality of life in Malaysia. \nMr Fahad Naeem, country director at recruitment agency Randstad Malaysia, said that when it comes to talent attraction and retention, government initiatives and employer efforts must go hand-in-hand.\nHe said this is especially important after Covid-19, with governments around the world introducing new talent attraction schemes to draw top global talent to work in their countries.\n“These initiatives help enhance the overall strength of their local workforce and fill the talent pool gap. However, these initiatives must be complemented with attractive career opportunities that companies in Malaysia can offer. \n“Besides matching salary expectations, many talents are looking for employers that can offer positive employee experiences.” \nConversely, Dr Lee Hwok Aun, senior fellow and co-coordinator of the Malaysia Studies Programme at Singapore's Iseas-Yusof Ishak Institute, said reducing the pay gap is paramount.\n“Malaysians residing in Singapore and working in semi-skilled and low-skilled jobs can be attracted to return to Malaysia, but it will be a challenge and requires further study. \n“But I would hypothesise that the job offerings may not be very different across the countries — noting the main semi-skilled occupations in the study are clerical service work, machine operators, and service and sales workers — and hence earnings differential is the main factor,” he said.

            "Article Summary": "Many Malaysians relocate to work in Singapore for better opportunities, higher salaries and advantageous exchange rates.\nThe Malaysian government recently released an official study into Malaysians living in Singapore, and warned of the \"adverse effects\" of the brain drain as skilled workers leave Malaysia.\nEconomists and experts told TODAY that Malaysia's talent exodus has not reached a dire level yet, but if left unchecked, could eventually hamper its economic growth and development.\nThis would also not be in Singapore's interest, given how closely intertwined both countries' economies are.\nMalaysian workers whom TODAY spoke to said Malaysia must address political stability and pay gap as well as invest in infrastructure to encourage its diaspora to return",
            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — Despite having a successful sales career, a workplace with supportive colleagues, and a stable relationship in Malaysia, Ms Anna Chin still felt something was missing. \nAnd so, like many of her fellow compatriots with big dreams, the Malaysian started considering looking southwards: Singapore. \n“I got hold of an opportunity from a recruiter, which made me contemplate whether moving to Singapore would be a good decision. \n“Since Singapore and Malaysia have similar cultures, food, and languages, I thought it would be nice to have the opportunity to work overseas but in a place that doesn’t feel too different from home,” she told TODAY. \nMs Chin, who holds a bachelor’s degree in science, thought she could benefit from the regional experience. She had expected to stay in Singapore for just a few years and then head home. \nFast forward to six years later, the 33-year-old medical sales executive is now a Singapore permanent resident, happily married to a Singaporean, and is looking for a flat as her forever home here. \nConsidering how her life had taken an unexpected turn since she uprooted herself, Ms Chin said she plans to have children and settle down in Singapore for good.  \n“After moving, I feel less connected to home. I miss my family. It’s a little sad that I am the only one missing out on important events and gatherings like Chinese New Year and birthdays.\n“But my life is here now, and to the Chinese, it’s customary to follow and stay with your husband’s side of the family,” she said.\nMs Chin has three siblings, aged 31, 45, and 48, all still living in their hometown of Ipoh. \nMs Chin’s experience will surely resonate with the Malaysian diaspora residing and working in Singapore. \nTake Ms Audrey Yeap, for example. The 30-year-old, who works as a senior executive in branch operations at a local bank, married a Singaporean citizen after working and living in Singapore for seven years.  \nThe Ipoh native moved to the Lion City in 2016 right after graduating from university, having no prior work experience in Malaysia other than a three-month internship in Kuala Lumpur. \n“When I was just a kid, my parents took me to Singapore for the holidays. Back then, I didn’t know anything about the currency exchange rate or the strength of the dollar. \n“All I knew was a PlayStation Portable cost about S$200 then, but in Malaysia, it was around RM800. I only understood figures, and thought it would be great to live in a place where I didn’t have to pay so much for things I wanted,” she told TODAY. \nAs she grew older, Ms Yeap eventually realised that earning Singapore dollars would mean increased spending power, thus reinforcing her belief that Singapore was an attractive country to relocate to. \nConversely, Malaysian technology startup founder Joshua Lee (not his real name), 40, had never considered moving to Singapore all his life. Still, he found himself mulling over it after being offered the role of chief technology officer at a local firm more than two years ago. \n“My business was affected after Covid-19, and I had to make a decision to protect the well-being of my staff,\" said Mr Lee, who declined to be named. \n“So when a Singaporean boss offered to buy my company and relocate me to work for him in the Singapore office, while retaining all 13 workers to work from home in Malaysia, I accepted it.”\nLast year, Malaysia's then Human Resources Minister V Sivakumar, said that as of 2022, 1.13 million out of 1.86 million Malaysians who migrated abroad were living in Singapore. \nWhile Singapore alone absorbs over 60 per cent of Malaysia’s diaspora, most of the remainder reside in countries located on the other side of the world, such as the United Kingdom and the United States. \nMs Anna Lim, 32, is one of them. Now based in California, she said that many of her friends had left Malaysia for Singapore in search of better pay and opportunities.\n“Even growing up, I was encouraged to find work elsewhere, such as Singapore or China. Also, I am interested in game development and the entertainment industry, and I am more likely to find a high-paying job in those industries in the US than in Malaysia. \n“Malaysia still does not value the arts in the way it should, even though many game studios are based there. Unfortunately, money talks,” she said.\nBefore being retrenched recently, Ms Lim, who hails from Penang, was a data analyst at a television technology company in San Francisco.  \nAlthough many young, bright Malaysians grow up under their home country’s education system, they may harbour dreams and aspirations that cannot be fulfilled at home. Hence, countries as near as Singapore and as far as the US become talent magnets.\nBut what does this mean for Malaysia if a significant proportion of its young, skilled labour force seeks long-term work outside of the country with the possibility of permanent relocation?\nA Malaysia governmental study in 2022, released last week, revealed that more than half of the Malaysian diaspora in Singapore have tertiary-level qualifications. \nOf those employed here, nearly three in four, or 74 per cent, are skilled and semi-skilled workers. \nA media statement released by the Malaysian authorities about the study warned of the “adverse effects” of the brain drain as skilled workers leave the country.\nTODAY looks at the broader implications of this talent outflow on Malaysia’s workforce and economy, and how this may adversely impact Singapore if the phenomenon continues on a greater scale. \nMalaysians working in Singapore and Brunei are generally attracted by good job prospects, stable employment, attractive salaries, and an advantageous exchange rate, according to the Malaysian government study released on Feb 19.\nIt was conducted by the Department of Statistics Malaysia, an agency under the Prime Minister’s Department, and the Ministry of Economy. \nOn career planning, 62 per cent of the Malaysian diaspora in Singapore polled said they would continue working abroad, while the remainder voted for “no” or “not sure”. \nThe study also found that most Malaysians tend to work in Singapore for at least three years, with 33.2 per cent staying for three to five years. \nMeanwhile, 48.4 per cent have stayed here for six years or more, and 3 per cent have migrated. \nMore than two-thirds of those living and working here earn a gross salary of S$1,500 to S$3,599 a month.\nHowever, the study did not indicate the total number of Malaysians surveyed. \nMs Ashlyn Ong, 32, has braved the daily commute between Johor Bahru and Singapore for over six years for the sake of enjoying higher spending power thanks to the strong Singapore dollar. \n“When I left, the exchange rate (of S$1 to ringgit) was around 2.9 or 3.0. Now, it’s at 3.5 and rising. \n“Earning RM2,500 and S$2,500 is completely different. You can buy a lot more things with S$2,500, but with RM2,500, it’s easily spent with no savings left.”  \nAlthough she resigned from her position as a customer service officer in Singapore in January to take a break from the toll of the gruelling daily commute, Ms Ong told TODAY that she would still look for another job in Singapore once she is ready to get back to the grind. \nIpoh-based beautician Tracey Tan, 33, decided to move to Singapore with her husband in 2018 to work shortly after giving birth to her son.\nWith a combined household income of around RM5,000 (S$1,413) then, the couple needed more savings to ensure they could comfortably bring up their child.\nIn Singapore, she was hired for the same job as a beautician, while her husband was hired as a cook, and they collectively earned around S$5,000 (RM17,600). \n“We were so fortunate that we decided to come home in January 2020, right before Covid-19, because our son needed to be ferried to kindergarten, and his nanny didn’t know how to drive,” she said. \nMs Tan, who now lives and work in Ipoh, said she cherished the opportunity of working in Singapore because she could save a lot more in ringgit after converting her Singapore dollar savings. \n“If I didn’t have a kid, I would have probably continued working in Singapore because I can get more savings faster and achieve my dream of bringing my whole family for an overseas trip together.” \nSingapore’s safety and reliable public transport were also pull factors for Ms Yeap, the bank employee.\n“I love how safe Singapore is. It is also easy to commute everywhere. When I had just arrived here, I could rent a room near my workplace, so commuting to work was a breeze.\n“(During) my internship experience in Kuala Lumpur before graduation, I had to endure a 1.5-hour jam to get to work and then another 1.5 hours to get home,” she said. \nFor engineer Jonathan Lim, besides Singapore’s strong currency, working abroad has always been on his bucket list and that Singapore is a good starting point. \nThe 27-year-old Kuala Lumpur native said: “I also think I should explore more at my younger age, before having significant commitments such as family and mortgage in Malaysia.”\nMr G Peremkumar, 32, a senior staff nurse at a private hospital, said he moved to Singapore almost 10 years ago seeking exposure to a better healthcare system. \n“The Singapore healthcare system is completely different (from Malaysia), especially in terms of patient experience and patient care,” said the Penang native who worked for over two years as a nurse in Malaysia.\n“Compared to my experience back in Malaysia, where I didn't think I was learning from the best practices, I get to grow and learn a lot more from the people here who have higher, stricter standards.”\nIn response to TODAY's queries, Ms Janice Foo, head of people at professional services firm KPMG, said that it aims to “attract the brightest minds from anywhere in the world”.\nIt sees a “healthy number of applicants from Malaysia who exemplify these qualities, and many of them have chosen to build thriving careers with us”, she said.\n“Certainly, employees from Malaysia may see Singapore’s proximity and reputation as a vibrant business hub as factors that are beneficial to them.”\nWith Singapore being the preferred work destination for Malaysians looking to work abroad, Malaysia's chief statistician Mohd Uzir Mahidin said in his statement accompanying the study that the country needs a shift in perspective to address the brain drain. \nHe said it is bound to have an adverse financial effect, considering that a significant portion of those employed abroad had received their education in Malaysia. \n“Malaysia must reframe the narrative around brain drain, transforming it into a positive concept known as ‘brain circulation’.\n“This shift in perspective means that the Malaysian diaspora will eventually return to Malaysia after a predetermined period, thereby contributing their acquired expertise and experiences back to the country,” he said. \nDr Mohd Uzir also said the Malaysian government needs to adopt a holistic approach — extending beyond the confines of government ministries and agencies — to leverage the “brain circulation” concept as a strategy. \nHe emphasised that efforts should not just focus on bringing Malaysians back to their home country, but also on utilising their skills to benefit Malaysia while ensuring their well-being upon their return.\n“The ability to reshape the Malaysian labour market will not only bolster the economy but will also, in the long term, exert an indirect influence on factors such as the Malaysian ringgit currency rate, wage levels, and advancements in automation and industrial mechanisation.”\nMalaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, in addressing the brain drain issue last September, said that his administration was looking into ways to attract skilled Malaysians to return and contribute to the country.\n“Top scholars, top economists, top accountants are leaving (the country) or have left, so now we have to make sure that we have a system that could encourage them to come back with the incentives,” he said during a visit to New York. \nMalaysian and Singaporean economists whom TODAY spoke to said that Malaysia’s brain drain has not reached a dire level yet, but the effects would still be felt in the long term.\nIf left unchecked, the continuous loss of talent would eventually hamper economic growth. \nSunway University economics professor Yeah Kim Leng said the outflow to Singapore had not adversely affected Malaysia's labour market, given the existing slack. \nAccording to the Department of Statistics Malaysia, there were 187,800 unemployed graduates at the end of 2022, a decrease of 5.5 per cent from the previous year. \nThe graduate unemployment rate was 3.7 per cent, which, according to Dr Yeah, was “marginally lower” than the overall unemployment rate of 3.9 per cent in 2022. \n“The rise in labour force participation rate, both overall and for graduates — together with the present level of unemployment — suggests that the country’s manpower needs are being met,” he said. \nDr Yeah said Malaysia’s current “brain drain” may not be as bad as that experienced during the 1970s and 1980s due to its labour surplus.\n“It is nevertheless concerning as the outflow of talents could dent the country’s structural upgrading to a higher value, innovation-driven and knowledge-based economy.  \n“In the longer term, the loss of talents could hamper the country’s aspiration to be an advanced and high-income nation,” he said. \nDr Yeah, who is one of the five advisers to Malaysia’s Ministry of Finance, added that if not for the loss of human capital, the nation “could well have become developed and achieved high-income status a decade or two earlier”.  \nAssociate Professor Alwyn Lim, from the Singapore Management University (SMU), echoed Dr Yeah’s sentiments, saying that Malaysia’s population is “large enough” to mitigate any economic impact from migrating skilled workers. \nMalaysia has an estimated population of 33.7 million, compared with Singapore’s 5.92 million. \n“In that sense, I do not see an economic impact large enough to slow down co-prosperity efforts,” he said, referring to Singapore's and Malaysia's economies’ co-dependence. \nAssoc Prof Lim, however, noted that the economic contributions of nearly a million Malaysian workers are not insignificant. \n“Many workers in Malaysia can perform lower-skilled work, so the more concerning trend would be higher-skilled Malaysians who choose to work in Singapore, or elsewhere, whose skills cannot be easily replaced and whose value contributions to the economy may be higher. \n“Higher-skilled Malaysian migration will probably continue to increase, and this will be a limitation for those domestic sectors in Malaysia that rely on the value contribution of higher-skilled Malaysians,” he said. \nWhile many of Malaysia’s skilled and semi-skilled workers are eager to seek their fortunes abroad, they are also much sought after by employers in Singapore grappling with rising costs and manpower shortage. \nMr Clement Tan, director of Malaysia recruitment agency Talent Recruit, said while he serves clients from various sectors looking to hire Malaysians, healthcare and education stand out in terms of demand. \n“Cost is the main priority from the clients’ side. Secondly, they feel that Singaporeans can be rather choosy, making it challenging for them to hire Singaporeans, especially for lower-level positions such as operator, retail worker, and kitchen worker,” he said. \nMr Jim Wee, director of Singapore-based recruitment firm Nala Employment, said most of his clients would start considering Malaysian candidates for the job if they are unable to hire locally after a month. \nAs the firm specialises in hiring Malaysians, around 90 per cent of its clients, mostly from the manufacturing, engineering, and hospitality sectors, would approach the firm looking for these workers.\n“Malaysian candidates are often considered the next-best alternative to other nationalities due to the culture and language, which are the closest to Singapore. \n\"The hiring process is quicker for Malaysian candidates, as they can attend face-to-face interviews within a few days if shortlisted,” said Mr Wee. \nWhile it is widely believed that foreign workers are cheaper, Mr Hazmi Zin, a third-generation owner of Rumah Makan Minang restaurant, disputed this, saying it costs about the same for him to hire a local and a foreigner. \nMalaysians currently make up one-third of his business' 40 workers. \n“For Malaysian Work Permit holders, the basic salary is around S$1,500, with additional earnings from overtime work. We also need to consider levies, which range from S$350 to S$800, depending on their educational background,” he said. \nThe foreign worker levy is a pricing mechanism to regulate the number of foreigners in Singapore. Employers must pay a monthly levy for Work Permit holders. \nBesides the monthly pay, Mr Hazmi also provides lodging, which costs S$500 to S$600 a month per person. In total, a single foreign worker would cost nearly S$3,000 to hire. \nIn comparison, local workers are paid between S$2,000 and S$2,400, excluding Central Provident Fund contributions. \nHaving relied on Malaysian workers for years, Mr Hazmi said their turnover rate can be high because they would go home once they have worked for a couple of years and hit their savings targets. \n“When given a choice, I would prefer to hire local workers, but because of the nature of the job, it is difficult to operate solely with locals,” he said. \nThe hairdressing industry in Singapore faces similar struggles. Chez Vous salon chief director Serene Tan said while they prioritise Singaporeans in the hiring process, they have no choice but to recruit workers from Malaysia due to a lack of local talent. \n“Many salons actively seek out locals with hairdressing experience, offering higher pay and benefits to attract them. However, the hairdressing industry is not favoured by Singaporeans, despite offering competitive pay compared to graduates,” she told TODAY. \nMs Tan attributed the lack of interest to several factors, such as low starting pay, weekend work, and irregular hours. “Many also perceive the profession of a hairdresser as lower-skilled, or it is for those who ‘cannot study’.”  \nAgreeing with Mr Hazmi’s on the pay issue, Ms Tan said hiring Malaysian workers is not necessarily cheaper due to the foreign worker levies. “In some cases, hiring Malaysians with higher education levels may incur higher costs than hiring locals.”\nWith the rise of remote working, some Singaporean employers look to hire Malaysians to support operations without having to move here. \nMr Keith Tan, founder and chief executive officer of Crown Digital, a tech startup behind Singapore’s first robot barista Ella, is one such example.\nExplaining his decision, he said hiring in Singapore can be highly challenging due to a limited pool of tech talents who seek “premium” salaries upon graduation. \n“A fresh graduate from NTU (Nanyang Technology University) demanded a pay of S$6,500. The high labour cost in Singapore makes business operations unsustainable, as workers often seek substantial pay increases after a year.\n“I am looking to Malaysia because of a larger talent pool that does not come at a ‘premium’ cost,” he said.\nAsked about Malaysia’s brain drain impact on Singapore, Assoc Prof Lim of SMU said the economic migration is largely positive as the Republic’s falling birth rate means it requires more workers from abroad to sustain or accelerate its economy. \n“There will, however, be increased competition for that stratum of jobs that Malaysians seek in Singapore. Hopefully, this will encourage Singapore workers to add more value to their services or move up the skills ladder,” he said. \nWhile Singapore seems to be reaping the economic benefits from Malaysia’s flow of skilled and semi-skilled talent into the country, economists also told TODAY that not everything would be rosy in the long run as the two will need each other to do well in order to thrive. \nAssociate Professor Walter Theseira from the Singapore University of Social Sciences said that with the two economies closely intertwined, the success of one economy often mirrors the success of the other. \n“Take, for instance, firms headquartered in Singapore that conduct operations in Malaysia. A weak Malaysian economy could directly impact their profitability. \n“Moreover, as Singapore often serves as a regional hub for business services, any setbacks in Southeast Asian growth diminish its allure as an investment destination. We naturally prefer to see our neighbouring economy thrive, as any slowdown could indicate underlying issues with economic management or structural challenges,” he said. \nSimilarly, Mr Song Seng Wun, an economic adviser at financial service provider CGS International, said that due to the strong intra-regional trade in the Asean region and Singapore's heavy reliance on external trade, any external shock would quickly impact its economy.\nAsean comprises Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Laos, Brunei, Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines, and Cambodia.\nHence, he said there is a mutual dependency among Asean countries.\n\"Currently, regional growth is resulting in higher-income jobs, increased disposable income, and greater demand for services. This growth fosters intra-regional trade and spillover effects.\n\"To Singapore, it is especially important. We want everyone to do well, so they can spend a few hundred dollars here to go to the Taylor Swift concert, for example,\" he said. \nWith all that has been said and done about Malaysia’s brain drain, the question remains: What will it take for the Malaysian diaspora to feel incentivised to return home and contribute to their country’s economy? \nAudit associate Phua Jia Herl, 25, who has worked in Singapore for almost two years, said Malaysia must first fix its political issues. \n“If the political parties keep arguing with one another, it shows we are politically unstable. How can we attract foreign investments if that were the case?” \nThe Kuala Lumpur native also stressed that political parties should refrain from exploiting racial issues and move past racial politics.\n“(Some politicians) often propagate negative videos on platforms like TikTok, inciting hatred towards other racial groups. This divisive behaviour may deter some Malaysians like myself from coming back.” \nHe expressed hope that Malaysia could invest more in infrastructure, such as the rail network, as it would stimulate the economy and bring significant benefits.\nMr Lim, the engineer working in Singapore, said there is a need for the authorities to invest not only in infrastructure but also in public services and amenities to improve the overall quality of life in Malaysia. \n“In the long run, when it comes to the family planning stage, returnees will also look for healthcare facilities for their parents, education systems for future generations, and reliable transportation networks, all of which play important roles in their lives.” \nMr Fahad Naeem, country director at recruitment agency Randstad Malaysia, said that when it comes to talent attraction and retention, government initiatives and employer efforts must go hand-in-hand.\nHe said this is especially important after Covid-19, with governments around the world introducing new talent attraction schemes to draw top global talent to work in their countries.\n“These initiatives help enhance the overall strength of their local workforce and fill the talent pool gap. However, these initiatives must be complemented with attractive career opportunities that companies in Malaysia can offer. \n“Besides matching salary expectations, many talents are looking for employers that can offer positive employee experiences.” \nMr Fahad cited his company’s Employer Brand Research 2023 findings, which found that non-monetary benefits are important to 87 per cent of respondents. \nHe noted that the top non-monetary benefits Malaysians look for are flexible work arrangements, being able to forge good working relationships with their managers and colleagues, and having more autonomy at work.\nConversely, Dr Lee Hwok Aun, senior fellow and co-coordinator of the Malaysia Studies Programme at Singapore's Iseas-Yusof Ishak Institute, said reducing the pay gap is paramount.\n“Malaysians residing in Singapore and working in semi-skilled and low-skilled jobs can be attracted to return to Malaysia, but it will be a challenge and requires further study. \n“But I would hypothesise that the job offerings may not be very different across the countries — noting the main semi-skilled occupations in the (Malaysian) study are clerical service work, machine operators, and service and sales workers — and hence earnings differential is the main factor,” he said. \nWhile economic factors such as higher salaries, higher spending power and better job opportunities prompted her to move to the other side of the world, San-Francisco-based Ms Lim said one of the reasons she moved to the US was also due to her sexuality.   \n“I am bisexual and married to a woman. Personally, until attitudes towards LGBTQ people change, I don't think I'll be able to return. I would prefer to stay in a country where my marriage is acknowledged,” Ms Lim said, using the acronym for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer.\n“Outside of that, money and attitudes towards the arts would potentially sway me to come back — and a nice, heaping plate of char kway teow.” ADDITIONAL REPORTING BY DEBORAH LAU "

            "Article Body": "Each week, TODAY’s long-running Big Read series delves into the trends and issues that matter. This week, we look at the SkillsFuture initiative and what new moves announced at Budget 2024 mean for workers and employers. This is a shortened version of the full feature, which can be found here.\nSINGAPORE — Whenever her air-conditioning unit broke down, Dr Chua Yen Ping used to wonder what needed to be fixed when the repair man could solve her woes in just minutes.\nSo the 48-year-old mathematics lecturer at a polytechnic decided to spend her SkillsFuture credits on a three-month course on air-conditioner maintenance.\nWhile she is still unable to repair her air-conditioner — the course was “too technical” with little hands-on experience — Dr Chua said it started her journey in 2021 to learn different skills such as electrical repairing.\n“Recently I applied for a course to learn about artificial intelligence (AI). But I’ve also spent money on courses that are not deductible (through SkillsFuture) like a course to learn Italian.”\nWith about S$100 in SkillsFuture credits left, she plans to spend it on learning about car maintenance.\nBut when asked if she would spend the credits on skills related to her job, Dr Chua hesitated.\n“There are a lot of resources available online for educators from a variety of sources worldwide,” she told TODAY.\n“It’s something I do daily too and am more involved in… I would rather use my SkillsFuture credits on other things.\n“But with the new initiative (announced during the) Budget, where we get more credits to spend on more specific courses, it could be interesting. I might have a look at the courses available once there’s more information and see if any are relevant to me… maybe something related to AI.”\nTo promote lifelong learning and increase the employability of people amid a fast-changing world grappling with technological disruptions, the Government started the SkillsFuture initiative in 2015.\nAbout 35 per cent of Singaporeans took part in training programmes under SkillsFuture in its inaugural year.\nIn 2022, training participation rates improved to about 50 per cent, said Minister of State for Education Gan Siow Huang in response to a parliamentary question on Jan 10 this year.\nThe SkillsFuture initiative, which is into its 10th year, has seen Singaporeans taking courses as diverse as flower arrangement and folk dancing. Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong recently announced new initiatives that are seen to be aimed at taking SkillsFuture to the next level.\nIn his Budget 2024 speech on Feb 16, Mr Wong, who is also the Finance Minister, unveiled several new initiatives to nudge mid-career workers to take up SkillsFuture training programmes that are more closely related to work skills.\nThis includes giving all Singaporeans aged 40 and above a S$4,000 top-up in SkillsFuture credits in May.\nThese new credits, unlike the basic S$500 credits that Singaporeans receive when they turn 25 years old, will be more targeted in scope.\n\"We will confine its usage to selected training programmes with better employability outcomes,\" said Mr Wong, who is also Finance Minister.\nSingaporeans aged 25 and older received S$500 in credits from 2016.\nIn 2020, the Government gave these citizens a one-off S$500 top-up, which expires at the end of 2025.\nWith technological advancements and shorter lifespan of skills, human resource (HR) experts said it has become increasingly important for mid-career workers to be able to take reskilling courses that are effective.\n“It's not just about staying relevant. It's about seizing opportunities that were (once) inaccessible and enabling workers to be updated with the latest technology know-how to maintain their employability,” said Mr Gavin Teo, director at recruitment firm Michael Page Singapore.\nSecond Minister for Finance and National Development Indranee Rajah told news radio station CNA938 on Feb 19 that the SkillsFuture boost announced in Mr Wong’s Budget speech will focus on growth areas.\n“Digitalisation, sustainability, these are key growth areas. And then of course you have our usual ones, electronics and manufacturing …. Basically, anything where there's growth, we encourage people to pursue,” she said.\nMid-career workers in their late 30s and 40s told TODAY that taking on these courses comes at some cost — be it their personal or work time — and they are more interested in taking courses of their own interests.\nThe tangible results from courses are not always obvious, said owners of small and medium-sized enterprise (SMEs), especially for courses on soft skills.\nAnd with over 29,000 courses available under the SkillsFuture scheme, individuals and SMEs said they have problems figuring out what courses would best suit their needs.\nMr Ang Yuit, president of the Association for Small and Medium Enterprises, said: “There’s such a wide variety of courses, so SMEs have a challenge when it comes to decision making.\n“For example, you wish to send a staff for a course and search for one. There’s so much information, it’s hard to tell if a course fits your company’s needs. After reading for 20, 30 minutes, you have no idea and just give up as you have work to clear. Sending employees on such workshops just goes into the backburner.”\nAnd as SMEs are smaller and may have less resources than multinational corporations, Mr Ang noted that some companies may face manpower struggles when employees go for courses that last longer than a day.\nThe quality and nature of courses available through SkillsFuture has also been questioned several times.\nOn Thursday (Feb 22), SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) and the National Environment Agency released a statement defending a S$580 course on toilet cleaning listed on the SkillsFuture learning portal that had garnered flak online.\nThe government agencies said that the course is important to ensure cleaning industry workers are efficient and effective at what they do, and is a requirement for licensed cleaning businesses.\nSeveral bogus claims and scams related to SkillsFuture have also occurred over the years.\nThe largest fraud case involved a syndicate which registered nine dormant entities and made 8,391 claims to SSG in 2017, resulting in nearly S$40 million of training grants being disbursed to the entities. \nThese submissions involved 25,141 employees purportedly working for six applicant entities, who had purportedly attended training courses conducted by three training providers.\nIn response to these incidences, SSG said in 2017 that it had implemented “mystery shopping audits” to catch unethical and misleading marketing practices, strengthened the sensitivity of its data analytics system to detect anomalies, and stepped up the frequency of checks and audits on training providers and individual claims.\nTo address the quality of courses, SSG also implemented the Training Quality and Outcomes Measurement in July 2018, where it surveys course participants based on the course quality and its impact on work and career. Participation in the survey is “strongly encouraged” but not required.\nGiven these challenges, educational institutions providing reskilling courses for mid-career workers have adjusted their courses to fit the needs of their mature students.\nThese include creating asynchronous lessons, workplace learning programmes which involves \"developing workplace learning blueprints, coaching workplace trainers and helping with job redesign”, and having project elements in courses that workers can implement in their companies.\nBut beyond that, businesses could also take their own initiative to assess what courses fit their employees best, said Ms Jenny Su, senior director of executive search firm Ethos BeathChapman. This includes:\nExperts and businesses also made several suggestions on what could be done to boost skills training, including cultivating on-the-job training, enhancing financial support for business and showcasing more mid-career workers who benefit from upgrading their skills through courses.\nFor private educational institutions, they hope that the S$4,000 additional SkillsFuture credits could be used by mid-career workers to defray the cost of education in their institutions.\nNonetheless, Dr Charles Ong, dean and director of health and life sciences at private educational institution PSB Academy, said private educational institutions will also be “pushed to step up to ensure their programmes align with the Government's goals” through the initiative.\nThis includes offering training to support career switchers, and adjusting teaching methods and entry requirements to suit mature learners.\nBut as many incentives and nudges are given by companies and the Government, individuals need to push themselves to take the step and reskill themselves, said experts, schools and business owners.\nThis is something that Mr Hisham Ong, 40, senior manager in data and analytics for Asean and South Pacific in the Coca-Cola Company, agrees with.\n\"Time is a luxury an individual has, it's really up to them to prioritise their time and to say that they are ready to take up the challenge,\" he told TODAY.\nHe had been apprehensive about the rigours of entering formal education while juggling his work life and family life, but Mr Ong said he took the \"leap of faith\" to study for a Graduate Diploma in Sustainability at the Singapore University of Social Sciences.\n\"(The graduate diploma) gives you the basic grounding. While on the job, people don't have the luxury of time to explain things,\" said Mr Ong, who was able to use SkillsFuture credits for three of his six subjects.\n\"I believe that choosing to study represents a significant opportunity for me to enhance my professional growth, stay abreast of sustainability trends, and bring more value to my role in the sustainability space.\""

This is an annual increase of around 12,000 per year, from 156,000 in 2019.\nSSG is the government agency under the Ministry of Education that is driving the national movement to promote a culture of lifelong learning.\nThen Education Minister Ong Ye Kung said in 2020 that more than 90 per cent of the SkillsFuture claims made by Singaporeans for training courses are work-related, and the Government should not deny people the resources to take charge of their careers because of the \"small minority\" who don't.  \nHe added that several courses, like flower arrangement and baking, may be perceived as leisure-related but they are a profession for some. \nWith the SkillsFuture initiative into its 10th year, it has seen Singaporeans taking courses as diverse as pet care and folk dancing. Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong recently announced new initiatives that are seen to be aimed at taking the national movement to the next level.\nIn his Budget 2024 speech on Feb 16, Mr Wong, who is also the Finance Minister, unveiled moves to encourage mid-career workers to take up SkillsFuture training programmes that are more closely related to work skills.\nThis includes giving all Singaporeans aged 40 and above a S$4,000 top-up in SkillsFuture credits in May.\nThese new credits, unlike the basic S$500 credits that Singaporeans receive when they turn 25 years old, will be more targeted in scope.\n\"We will confine its usage to selected training programmes with better employability outcomes,\" said Mr Wong, who is also Finance Minister.\nSingaporeans aged 25 and older received S$500 in credits from 2016.\nIn 2020, the Government gave these citizens a one-off S$500 top-up, which expires at the end of 2025. \nWith technological advancements and shorter lifespan of skills, human resource (HR) experts said it has become increasingly important for mid-career workers to be able to take reskilling courses that are effective.\n“It's not just about staying relevant.

While this has helped her identify problems with her air-conditioning unit at times, she had expected more hands-on experience during the course.\nAnother handyman course on electrical repairs she took taught her how to repair only one electrical equipment — her oven — as the day-course involved her bringing her own electronic equipment for repairs.\nWhile she said it was a fun and fruitful experience, the skill’s application was limited.\nMs Dawn Lim, 29, co-founder and chief executive officer of customer experience consultancy Alnico, also felt the tangible benefits were not obvious after sending some of her employees for several reskilling courses in 2021.\nThrough the SkillsFuture Queen Bee initiative — where industry leaders reskill SMEs in the similar industry by identifying the skills required — three of her employees were assigned to two or three short courses such as design thinking and on effective coaching for workplace trainers.\nHowever, this did not result in a significant improvement in the quality of the work done by her employees, said Ms Lim. This was based on satisfaction surveys with her company's clients.\n“I feel it’s a bit of a stretch for employees to retrain and comprehend these skills effectively, and what more apply, when they learn these through short courses that are only three days long at most.”\nThe quality and nature of courses available through SkillsFuture has been questioned several times.\nOn Thursday (Feb 22), SSG and the National Environment Agency released a statement defending a S$580 course on toilet cleaning listed on the SkillsFuture learning portal that had garnered flak online.\nThe agencies said that the course is important to ensure cleaning industry workers are efficient and effective at what they do.\n\"Through practical training, participants will learn effective cleaning methods, the proper use of cleaning agents, and adherence to safety protocols,” they said in a joint statement in response to TODAY’s queries.\nThe course is also a requirement for licensed cleaning businesses, and is applicable to job levels under the Cleaning Progressive Wage Model, which allows cleaners to earn higher wages as they undergo more training.\nSeveral bogus claims and scams related to SkillsFuture have also occurred over the years.\nThe largest fraud case involved a syndicate which registered nine dormant entities and made 8,391 claims to SSG in 2017, resulting in nearly S$40 million of training grants being disbursed to the entities. \nThese submissions involved 25,141 employees purportedly working for six applicant entities, who had purportedly attended training courses conducted by  three training providers.\nSeparately, in the same year, about 4,400 individuals made false claims to encash their SkillsFuture credits by claiming to attend courses which they did not.\nIn response, SSG said in 2017 that it had implemented “mystery shopping audits” to catch unethical and misleading marketing practices, strengthened the sensitivity of its data analytics system to detect anomalies, and stepped up the frequency of checks and audits on training providers and individual claims.\nTo address the quality of courses, SSG also implemented the Training Quality and Outcomes Measurement in July 2018, where it surveys course participants on the course quality and on its impact on work and career. Participation in the survey is “strongly encouraged” but not required.\nAs the job market rapidly changes, the need for mid-career workers to reskill and upskill has become more crucial than ever, HR experts told TODAY.\n“As the global skill landscape evolves, individuals, corporations, and governments must adapt swiftly to ensure that we can deliver to future needs,” said Ms Dolon Mitra, director of human resource transformation at consultancy Change Et Al.\nSingapore is on the right track, she said, as the 50 per cent utilisation of SkillsFuture credits is “a very impressive turnaround for a programme of this size, nature and complexity”.\nMr Teo added: “The challenge isn't just about finding time. It's also about creating courses that resonate with the diverse needs and interests of mid-career adults, ensuring they see the value in investing their time and effort into learning anew.”\nSecond Minister for Finance and National Development Indranee Rajah told news radio station CNA938 on Feb 19 that the SkillsFuture boost announced in Mr Wong’s Budget speech will focus on growth areas.\n“Digitalisation, sustainability, these are key growth areas. And then of course you have our usual ones, electronics and manufacturing …. Basically, anything where there's growth, we encourage people to pursue,” she said.\nSenior director of executive search firm Ethos BeathChapman Jenny Su said: “In today's fast-paced world, the skills we impart in courses must resonate deeply with the pulse of our industries.\n“Everything's going digital, AI and Generative AI is becoming a household name, and sustainability isn't just a buzzword anymore — it's a way of life.”\nShe added that it is crucial these courses are not treated like checkboxes to be ticked, but rather as a means of developing skills that workers can use to adapt to the ever-changing work landscape.\n“When we talk about (upgrading skills) and reskilling, we're talking about empowering individuals to not just keep up, but to lead,” she said.\n“If we don't uphold quality standards (of the courses), we risk undermining candidates’ trust and potentially hindering their career growth,” said Ms Su, adding that quality checks should be made consistently to ensure the effectiveness of courses.\nDr Charles Ong, dean and director of health and life sciences at private educational institution PSB Academy, said that technological advancements and industry shifts would mean shifts in educational trends.\nThese include growing focus on critical thinking, creativity, problem-solving and transferable skills like leadership and communication.\nCourses on digitalisation, which drives business growth and efficiency, and those which focus on specialised skills, such as data analytics and artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, will also be in greater demand.\nWhile mother-of-one Irene Yeo was browsing the SkillsFuture portal to look for a short course, she found the number of courses available overwhelming.\n“It’s just so much information. You don’t know which courses would suit you, and you still need to click on the courses’ webpage to find out more information,” she recalled of her exasperated attempt to find a course last year.\nTo spare herself from a headache, she simply closed the website.\nHer SkillsFuture credits have also remained untouched as she has little time to take a longer course.\n“When I get home, I need to take care of the family and by then I just need to rest,” said Ms Yeo, 44, an after-sales manager. “I just don’t have time to do anything.”\nShe took up a part-time degree from 2004 to 2007. While she did not have family commitments then, juggling her work and studies was “very stressful” — although she did have an understanding employer who helped her by providing leave for her examinations.\n“Now with a child and more life commitments, I don’t think I can find the energy to do any long courses anymore,” she admitted.\nWhile there is growing acceptance of the need for lifelong learning, several challenges — such as lack of time, support and inertia — need to be addressed to ensure that more mid-career workers take up skill upgrading workshops, said HR experts.\n“For many, upskilling may be essential, but it may not be perceived as urgent,” Ms Mitra said.\nChief executive officer of the Singapore Institute of Management Academy Ho Seong Kim noted that mid-career workers often have “demanding work schedules and personal commitments, making it difficult to find them to attend courses or engage in learning activities”.\n“Learning new skills can be intimidating too, for those who have been in the workforce for a long time and have established routines or expertise in their current roles.”\nFor SMEs, workers taking courses also comes with an opportunity cost — be it spending money on the courses, or having to work with a temporary shortage in manpower.\nMr Ang Yuit, president of the Association for Small and Medium Enterprises (ASME), said: “There’s such a wide variety of courses, so SMEs have a challenge when it comes to decision making.\n“For example, you wish to send a staff for a course and search for one. There’s so much information, it’s hard to tell if a course fits your company’s needs. After reading for 20, 30 minutes, you have no idea and just give up as you have work to clear. Sending employees on such workshops just goes into the backburner.”\nAnd as SMEs are smaller and may have less resources than multinational corporations, Mr Ang noted that some companies may face manpower struggles when employees go for courses that last longer than a day.\nMr Jarieul Wong, co-founder and communications director of public relations agency IN.Deed Communications, added that some companies have limited budgets — which means some workers may not have the opportunity to take part in a course.\nMs Lim of Alnico also pointed out that SMEs may not be able to translate courses into tangible benefits for the company. Hence, they might be more hesitant to send their employees on courses.\nShe added that some employees may not want to attend courses as they have work deadlines that have to be adjusted due to the courses taking up work time.\nHowever, some SMEs are viewing reskilling opportunities as a necessity to retain their employees — and rid them of the feeling of “stagnation” within the company.\n“Our new employees come in and they always say the same thing — they want to learn,” said Mr Adam Piperdy, chief experience officer and founder at event production house Unearthed Productions.\n“But at an SME, there will come a time where there is not much employees can learn from their bosses.”\nHis company allows employees to take a course every quarter. These courses are not necessarily related to their job scope, and employees can choose from the ones proposed during a monthly town hall, or by seeking approval from HR to attend courses they find themselves.\n“Our employees can broaden their spectrum, bring different skills to the table,” he said on the benefits of allowing his employees to take courses regularly.\nGiven these challenges, educational institutions providing reskilling courses for mid-career workers under the SkillsFuture framework have adjusted their courses to fit the needs of their mature students.\nMr Wong Jian Chang, director of Singapore Polytechnic’s (SP) Professional & Adult Continuing Education Academy, said it has developed more asynchronous lessons, allowing learners to learn “anytime and anywhere”.\n“While this is important, we augment them with face-to-face sessions so that learners can continue to interact, build networks, and have hands-on learning,” he said.\n“For greater clarity and assurance of competencies gained, both to the learners and to companies looking out for skills, SP has started to develop and launch micro-credentials with leading industry or professional bodies to define industry-relevant competencies and develop accreditation methods.”\nThe polytechnic also has workplace learning programmes, which allow companies to make learning more effective. This includes “developing workplace learning blueprints, coaching workplace trainers and helping with job redesign”, allowing workers to work and learn at the same time.\nTo address concerns related to tangible benefits from the courses, Republic Polytechnic’s (RP) programmes include project elements in the curriculum. This allows mid-career workers to “build their portfolio in a new area by completing a real-life project”, said Mr Sim Choon Hou, director of RP’s Academy for Continuing Education.\n“RP has also seen tremendous growth in our training-cum-project-consultancy model, where participants will bring to the table a problem that they want to solve after attending a course and our lecturers will work as a trainer-cum-consultant to them.”\nThrough this, the lecturer ensures the project can be completed by the end of the training period — motivating the mid-career worker through “small wins” and allowing companies to see the return of investment through the project implementation.\nDespite such bespoke courses, can more be done to encourage more employees, and their employers, to go on board the SkillsFuture train?\nMr Ho of the Singapore Institute of Management Academy said the Government could provide businesses with more resources they can invest in reskilling their employees. This could help alleviate some concerns such as cost.\nIn 2020, Finance Minister Lawrence Wong launched the SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit to allow businesses to defray up to 90 per cent of out-of-pocket expenses of business transformation, job redesign and skills training.\nEligible employers can claim the S$10,000 credit by June 30, 2025, after Mr Wong announced a one-year extension in his Budget 2024 speech.\nCreating recognition programmes for mid-career workers who have taken reskilling courses could also help motivate individuals, suggested Ms Mitra of Change Et Al.\nBut beyond that, businesses could also take their own initiative to assess what courses fit their employees best, said Ms Su of Ethos BeathChapman. This includes:\nBut as many companies and mid-career workers value on-the-job training and question the need for courses, Mr Ang of ASME wondered if more could be done to enhance such training in-house.\nThis could be through incentivising companies to better structure such on-the-job training programmes, so that employees are more aware of the skill sets they need and companies can focus on imparting these necessary skills, he suggested.\nThere is also a need to enhance awareness of case studies that showcase the benefits for individuals to take on courses related to their careers, said HR experts and trainers.\nFor private educational institutions, they hope that the S$4,000 additional SkillsFuture credits could be used by mid-career workers to defray the cost of education in their institutions.\nDr Ong of PSB Academy said that private educational institutions will also be “pushed to step up to ensure their programmes align with the Government's goals”.\nThis includes offering training to support career switchers, and adjusting teaching methods and entry requirements to suit mature learners.\n“Shorter, more focused programmes would work better for mid-career switches compared to the regular diploma courses designed for younger students,” said Dr Ong.\nFor Ms Cat Ang, a freelance artist and drama instructor, mid-career courses like those provided under SkillsFuture have benefited her a lot.\nShe took a diploma in people management, which taught her how to work with people better through various skills like communication and customer service. The skills also apply to her daily life as she uses these skills to communicate with her family clearly, she said.\nWhile taking on these courses comes at a cost — she has to sacrifice the time spent with her children and the number of classes she can teach — she said the investment is worth it in the long term.\nMost recently, the 49-year-old single mother took up a course on TikTok shop, which teaches people how to sell items on the social media platform.\nShe completed the course last November and has sold only two items thus far. But Ms Ang remains positive that the course has given her the skill sets to take on a career that provides her with time flexibility to care for her children.\n“The time and job opportunity sacrifice is temporary. There’ll be long-term benefits to these courses, and I believe it’ll allow me to have more time to care for my children while working as the sole breadwinner,” she said.\nBut as many incentives and nudges are given by companies and the Government, individuals need to push themselves to take the step and reskill themselves, said experts, schools and business owners.\n\"Time is a luxury an individual has, it's really up to them to prioritise their time and to say that they are ready to take up the challenge,\" said Mr Hisham Ong, 40, senior manager in data and analytics for Asean and South Pacific in the Coca-Cola Company.\nWhen he started his role in the company's sustainability department, he found himself exposed to the jargon and endless acronyms related to sustainability reporting.\nHe had been apprehensive about the rigours of entering formal education while juggling his work life and family life, but Mr Ong said he took a \"leap of faith\" to study for a graduate diploma in Sustainability at the Singapore University of Social Sciences.\n\"I believe that choosing to study represents a significant opportunity for me to enhance my professional growth, stay abreast of sustainability trends, and bring more value to my role in the sustainability space,\" said Mr Ong, who was able to use SkillsFuture credits for three of his six subjects.\n\"(The graduate diploma) gives you the basic grounding. While on the job, people don't have the luxury of time to explain things.\"\nHe may have just started in January, but the classes have already given him a better understanding of what sustainability entails and given him a better appreciation of the job.\n\"There's a lot of acronyms in sustainability and reporting standards that I've struggled to understand. But after six weeks of the course, I've gained a better understanding,\" said Mr Ong.\nWith another eight months ahead for his course, Mr Ong said the twice-weekly night classes are a worthwhile sacrifice of his time.\n\"It'll help me understand what we do at Coca-Cola, what sustainability is about and gain more appreciation for the job I'm doing,\" he said."

This is a shortened version of the full feature, which can be found here.\nSINGAPORE — E-commerce firm Lazada’s surprise move to cut jobs last month not only left some affected employees in tears, but also raised the eyebrows of industry watchers here. \nSome of the former employees’ concerns have since been addressed with the provision of an additional undisclosed support package following talks between Lazada and the workers' union.\nBut for several business analysts and industry experts whom TODAY spoke to, the Lazada move begs a bigger question: Could the heyday of e-commerce — which had experienced a surge during the Covid-19 pandemic — be over?\nPrior to Lazada’s sudden layoffs, its main competitor Shopee had also conducted three rounds of layoffs in 2022, in which staff in Singapore were affected. \nExperts have said that the pattern of layoffs from e-commerce firms echoes those by technology firms such as Meta, Google, Twitter (now X) and Grab, but Lazada, whose regional headquarters is in Singapore, has maintained that its situation is different.\nA source close to Lazada told TODAY that these tech firms had perhaps overhired to gain market share, and retrenched when they had to focus on profits.\nHowever, for Lazada, the layoffs are “a business transformation exercise”, said the source.\nResponding to queries from TODAY, a Lazada spokesperson said the firm has been raking in healthy revenue.\n“The numbers have shown that there has been no slowdown, it has been growing,” said the spokesperson. \n“But in the bigger picture, it also speaks to the evolution of the tech industry as a whole, because we are looking at companies who are left behind, and then have to make drastic cuts… Or like a company like Lazada who is looking to stay ahead of the curve.” \nTODAY had reached out to Shopee, the other main e-commerce player in Singapore, but it did not respond to queries.\nExperts say that the e-commerce firms face different challenges compared to other tech firms. \nWhile tech firms like Google, Meta and Grab have all already dominated their respective markets, for e-commerce in Singapore and the Southeast Asian region, there is no obvious leader, said Dr Ng Weiyi, Assistant Professor from the Department of Strategy and Policy at the National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School. \nFor instance, Google has dominated the search engine space and Meta the social media space with Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook. In Singapore, Grab has a predominant market share in the ride hailing space.\nHowever, the main e-commerce players in Southeast Asia and Singapore, Lazada and Shopee, are still jostling for a dominant market share.\n“Similarly, the parent companies expect Shopee and Lazada to dominate the e-commerce landscape, but the fact is that the landscape as of now is still very fragmented and saturated,” Dr Ng said. \nIn addition, e-commerce firms have a less-robust revenue stream, while the other tech companies have either multiple or more reliable revenue streams. \nProfessor Lawrence Loh, director of the Centre for Governance and Sustainability at NUS, said that for e-commerce firms, their ability to make money depends mostly on whether they generate enough demand from a “front-facing” customer, but this has become more difficult post-Covid-19. \n“Coming out of the pandemic, there’s a very obvious drop in demand for e-commerce, because people are showing up in brick-and-mortar shops again,” said Prof Loh.  \n“The general economic environment is also not favourable, so disposable income is also less.” \nTech firms, on the other hand, have more reliable sources of revenue. \nBoth Meta and Google, for instance, are making megabucks from advertisements.\nFor Grab, it generates revenues through multiple streams, including advertisements, ride-hailing and delivery fees, and transaction fees when payments are made through its e-wallet. \nExperts said that the challenges that most e-commerce firms have stemmed from the need to be profitable — gone are the days where companies are willing to splash money to gain market share. \n“The investment thesis underlying much of the industry — especially in Asia — that firms needed to position themselves early, lose money to acquire market share, and then make it up later with dominant positions and economies of scale, appears to be failing,” said Associate Professor Walter Theseira, an economist from the Singapore University of Social Sciences.\nThus, the focus and challenge that many e-commerce firms now face is in making profit. \n“I think this is the main reason why layoffs occur,” said Assoc Prof Theseira. “No firm would need to lay off workers if nobody cared about profits… Layoffs are all about improving the economic outcomes of the firm for investors and stakeholders.” \nThe need for profitability also comes amid a time when the e-commerce space is getting more crowded with competitors.  \n“The competitive arena is now more intense, beyond Lazada and Shopee, now you have new kids on the block like Temu and Shein, and they bring new value propositions into the whole game,” said Prof Loh from NUS.\n“(E-commerce firms) have to adjust their growth expectations accordingly.” \nTemu and Shein are online fashion brands from China. \nOn top of the rising cost of living that has reduced consumers’ desire to spend, the e-commerce sector has also been hit by rising supply chain and shipping costs due to disruptions.\n“The cost of supply is getting high, (including) labour cost, material costs, because of inflation… this adds to the pressure on the supplier and they will pass the costs back to the consumer,” said Prof Loh. \nWhat will these challenges to the e-commerce industry mean for consumers?\nDespite signs that the e-commerce sector is beginning to generate sustainable revenues, experts are doubtful that the industry in the region will maintain its status quo in the near future. \nThe current state of competition in the e-commerce market in Southeast Asia will likely lead to a “lose-lose” situation for firms, said Prof Loh.  \n“There’s really so much (e-commerce firms) can do but to go low on prices,” he said, noting that consumers are usually not loyal to any platform and thus will choose the one that offers the most attractive deals and lowest shipping costs. \nAgreeing, Dr Ng from NUS said that even amid a climate where profits are the priority, firms will be reluctant to cut back on offers and discounts as they will fear losing out to their competitors. \n“It's a Catch-22, If I’m (an e-commerce firm) and I skip the next 3.3 sale, for example, and (a competitor) does not, while this might aid the bottom line in the near future, it will make me lose market share in the long term. Is this a good outcome?\"\nA \"3.3\" sale refers to specific sales events that occur on March 3, but can also occur on any date which the number of the day matches that of the month. It is typically chosen by e-commerce firms to offer discounts and attract new customers. \nWhile this is good news for consumers who may enjoy lower prices, this may not last, given the fast pace of change in the e-commerce sector.\nExperts do not rule out a situation where one big e-commerce firm may bow out due to the fierce competition that still rages in the e-commerce arena here and in the region. \nThey pointed to a similar situation involving Grab and Uber in the 2010s. The ride-hailing firms were caught in a price battle after entering the Singapore market in 2013, offering various promotions and discounts for commuters and incentives for drivers. \nHowever, Uber eventually decided to exit the Southeast Asian market, and sold its operations to Grab in 2018.\nShould one e-commerce firm end up like Grab and become a dominant player in the industry, it is the customer that will lose out, said Dr Ng.\n“The moment someone bows out, discounts stop… This is a reflection of the venture capital strategy, the moment we dominate the market, we shift gears, focus on profitability, and stop subsidising the consumers.\" "

            "Article Summary": "Layoffs by e-commerce firms Lazada and Shopee in the last two years have led some to question whether the heyday of online shopping could be over .\nLazada had laid staff off to pre-empt future challenges such as a higher dependence on tech, and more complex marketing strategies.\nExperts say, however, that the job cuts also signal an increased focus on making profits, rather than pursuing a ‘growth at all cost’ mindset.\nThey add that given the fast-changing nature of the industry and competition among the firms, a big player may eventually bow out.\nShould that happen, then attractive discounts, low shipping costs that consumers enjoy now may be a thing of the past as competition dwindles.\nThe primary source of revenue is through commission fees from sellers for each successful sale made on the platform.

To take advantage of this, some staff without the relevant skills had to be let go, but new staff with the relevant AI expertise may be hired.\n“The whole transformation exercise is to refocus us to be agile, and streamline to delivering these two core pillars for the company,” she said. \nWhile adapting to new technologies and business strategies could lead to retrenchments, some experts pointed to another hard truth: Certain parts of the e-commerce business are no longer making profits or have been shown to be unprofitable, and so staff in those roles are laid off.\n“There will of course always be pivots in technology and business concepts, such as today's current rush to embrace AI, but these likely affect only a small fraction of staff,” said Associate Professor Walter Theseira, an economist from the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS).\n“Rather, the most likely explanation for the current wave of retrenchments is that too many tech firms have too many employees working in areas where firms and investors no longer believe there is a good return.”\nWhile e-commerce companies and tech firms, such as Google, Meta, X, and Grab, are involved in different businesses, they do have several similarities, said industry experts.\nMost of these prominent tech firms have relied on some form of venture capital in order to be viable, said Dr Ng Weiyi, Assistant Professor from the Department of Strategy and Policy at the National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School. \nVenture capital is money, technical, or managerial expertise provided by investors to startup firms which they perceive to have long-term growth potential.\nSuch venture capital values high risks and high returns, and typically focusses on growth and market leadership instead of profit and sustainability, said Dr Ng. \n“If I invest a million dollars in you, I don’t want you to put it in a safe investment and give me 8 per cent per annum… I rather you try and dominate the market, and grow,” he said. \nThis is the case for e-commerce companies and the other tech firms, said Dr Ng, but the difference is that the tech firms have all already dominated their respective markets, while for e-commerce in Singapore and the Southeast Asian region, there is no obvious leader. \nFor instance, Google has dominated the search engine space and Meta the social media space with Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook. In Singapore, Grab has a predominant market share in the ride-hailing space.\nHowever, the main e-commerce players in Southeast Asia and Singapore, Lazada and Shopee, are still jostling for a dominant market share.\n“Similarly, the parent companies expect Shopee and Lazada to dominate the e-commerce landscape, but the fact is that the landscape as of now is still very fragmented and saturated\",” Dr Ng said. \nThere are no reliable publicly available figures on market share of the sector.\nAnother difference is that e-commerce firms have a less-robust revenue stream, while the other tech companies have either multiple or more reliable revenue streams. \nProfessor Lawrence Loh, director of the Centre for Governance and Sustainability at the National University of Singapore (NUS), said that for e-commerce firms, their ability to make money depends mostly on whether they generate enough demand from a “front-facing” customer. \nThis is despite the e-commerce industry having various revenue streams such as commission fees, advertising revenue, subscription fees from firms listing their products on the platform, and logistics fulfilment services.  \nBut all these additional streams depend on sales it can generate from consumers, which has become more difficult post-Covid-19. \n“Coming out of the pandemic, there’s a very obvious drop in demand for e-commerce, because people are showing up in brick-and-mortar shops again,” said Prof Loh.  \n“The general economic environment is also not favourable, so disposable income is also less.” \nTech firms, on the other hand, have more reliable sources of revenue. \nBoth Meta and Google, for instance, are making megabucks from advertisements.\nFor Grab, it generates revenues through multiple streams, including advertisements, ride-hailing and delivery fees, and transaction fees when payments are made through its e-wallet. \nIn addition, services like ride-hailing have seen an increase in demand post-Covid, thus generating a more robust revenue stream for Grab, given social interactions have returned to normalcy, said Prof Loh.  \nLazada was established in Singapore in 2012, and by 2015, its gross merchandise value, or the total value of merchandise sold over a given period of time through customer-to-customer deals, had grown to over US$1.3 billion (S$1.75 billion), according to tech media platform KrAsia. \nIn April 2016, China’s largest e-commerce company, Alibaba, bought a majority stake in Lazada.  \nShopee was first launched in Singapore in 2015, as a subsidiary company of Sea Limited. In 2018, Shopee went on “an offensive” where it began aggressively advertising throughout Southeast Asia to expand its market there, according to KrAsia. \nShopee’s advertising campaigns included international stars such as South Korean girl group Blackpink in 2018 and footballer Cristiano Ronaldo in 2019. \nShopee eventually pulled ahead of Lazada, which was mired by cultural conflicts and boardroom tussles, by the time the pandemic struck the region in 2020, according to a 2021 report by online publisher Asia Times.  \nIn 2021, Shopee’s parent Sea was able to raise US$6 billion through an equity and convertible bond sale, the largest fundraising in Southeast Asia at that time.  \nHowever, Shopee’s fortunes soon changed. In 2022, less than a year after it had raised record funds, Sea cut more than 7,000 jobs in its offices in Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, China, and Singapore across three waves of retrenchments. \nThat year, Shopee also pulled out of markets it had expanded into, such as in France, Spain, India, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Argentina. It also pulled out of Poland in 2023. \nThen, in March 2023, Shopee laid off “fewer than 500” full-time and contract workers in Shopee’s customer service team in Indonesia, Bloomberg reported.\nThese measures helped Sea swing to a profit for 2023, its first annual profit since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2017. \nAn IPO is one of the methods that companies can use to go public, which will make its stock available to retail traders.\nAs for Lazada, its January 2024 retrenchment exercise came several months after Bloomberg reported in May 2023 that the e-commerce platform was exploring an IPO in the United States.  \nA smaller local player in Singapore's e-commerce scene is Ezbuy, which was founded here in 2010. According to business publication Vulcan Post, it was once dubbed as Singapore's largest global online shopping platform, connecting consumers to popular shopping sites like Taobao and Amazon. \nHowever, it was in 2018 that signs of Ezbuy's decline began to show, with staff leaving the firm, as well as as frictions with other e-commerce firms and allegations of scalping. \nFrom 2017 to 2021, Ezbuy's monthly web visits fell by over half, from 2.3 million to 1.07 million. \nAccording to Lazada, some of the challenges it had faced leading up to its retrenchment exercise — and will continue to face over the next few years — include fast-moving changes to technology and industry norms, as well as the demand patterns of its consumers. \n“The industry itself is always changing, and it’s very fast in terms of the speed of change,” said a Lazada spokesperson in response to queries from TODAY.  \nFor instance, just five years ago, e-commerce was seen by consumers as more of a transactional space where they enter the application, make their purchases, and then leave. \nThe industry, however, has since employed different ways to keep users on the application; one such way being the inclusion of games on the Lazada app, where consumers can earn points and discounts.\n“The company's innovative approaches to customer engagement have helped in customer loyalty and driving sales,” said the Lazada spokesperson.\n“Conventional forms of customer engagement that existed when Lazada first launched 12 years ago have now been replaced with creative gamification, which has been extremely successful with high usage rates in recent years.” \nTODAY had reached out to Shopee, which did not respond to queries. \nThe Lazada source who spoke to TODAY said that it had “done its best to support those with transferable skill sets to take on different roles or help workers with upskilling”.\nHowever, due to the fluidity of the e-commerce landscape, as well as fast-changing consumer needs and industry norms, some jobs had been lost across the e-commerce industry, the source said.\nAgreeing with Lazada’s assessment, Dr Jeffrey Towson, managing partner at tech consultancy TechMoat Consulting, said that e-commerce trends move quickly and companies often have to scramble to capture the market. Such trends include live-streaming e-commerce, and mobile wallets and payments. \n“The recent merger of video, commerce and social media into a new type of e-commerce means you need entirely new types of skills,” said Dr Towson. \n“Suddenly, you have to be an entertainment company, a retailer, and a logistics company.”\nUnlike brick-and-mortar stores, e-commerce firms like Lazada do not usually have a warehouse of goods, and instead act as a middleman between sellers and firms, and the consumer, said Prof Loh from NUS. \nThus, according to business education blog FourWeekMBA, e-commerce firms  generate revenue through several ways:\nHowever, experts also noted that the challenges that most e-commerce firms have stem from the need to be profitable — gone are the days where companies are willing to splash money to gain market share. \n“The investment thesis underlying much of the industry — especially in Asia — that firms needed to position themselves early, lose money to acquire market share, and then make it up later with dominant positions and economies of scale, appears to be failing,” said SUSS’ Assoc Prof Theseira. \nAgreeing, Dr Ng from NUS said that one of the reasons that venture capital is harder to come by is because of the high interest rate environment in the past few years, which has increased the cost of capital for such investments, making them less attractive. \nThus, the focus and challenge that many e-commerce firms now face is in making profit. \n“I think this is the main reason why layoffs occur,” said Assoc Prof Theseira. “No firm would need to lay off workers if nobody cared about profits… Layoffs are all about improving the economic outcomes of the firm for investors and stakeholders.” \nThe need for profitability also comes amid a time when the e-commerce space is getting more crowded with competitors.  \n“The competitive arena is now more intense, beyond Lazada and Shopee, now you have new kids on the block like Temu and Shein, and they bring new value propositions into the whole game,” said Prof Loh from NUS. “(E-commerce firms) have to adjust their growth expectations accordingly.” \nTemu and Shein are online fashion brands from China. \nOn top of the rising cost of living, reducing consumers’ desire to spend, the e-commerce sector has also been hit by rising supply chain and shipping costs due to disruptions.\nDuring the pandemic, sea freight rates surged to record highs. While the rates have dipped since, the ongoing Red Sea shipping crisis has caused rates to spike again.  \n“The cost of supply is getting high, (including) labour cost, material costs, because of inflation… this adds to the pressure on the supplier and they will pass the costs back to the consumer,” said Prof Loh.\nDr Ng added that even with higher shipping costs, e-commerce firms are still subsidising part or sometimes even all of the cost of shipping, especially for purchases above a certain amount.\n“Since with higher purchases, the absolute margin is higher, so (e-commerce firms) can subsidise the logistics costs (given the) economies of scale,” he said. \nFurthermore, low shipping cost is a key factor why e-commerce appeals to consumers and online marketplace platforms will be wary of losing customers if they raise rates. \nDespite the layoffs at the start of this year, Lazada’s business figures had been positive in 2023. \nSpeaking to TODAY, the source close to Lazada maintained that its retrenchment exercise was not due to the inability to generate revenue, but rather a shift to ensure it is “future-ready”. \nAccording to Alibaba’s (Lazada’s parent) report on its international e-commerce division, the subsection of international commerce retail, which Lazada falls under, had year-on-year growth of 60 per cent, 66 per cent and 62 per cent for the second, third and fourth quarter of 2023 respectively.\n“The numbers have shown that there has been no slowdown, it has been growing,” said the Lazada spokesperson. \nThe changes made in Lazada's workforce and job requirements speak to \"the rapid evolution of the tech industry\".\n“Companies that do not keep up with the dynamic customer needs will be left behind and eventually must take drastic and costly measures to their business processes and workforce,” the spokesperson said.\n“Companies like Lazada, who continuously look to stay ahead of the curve, will have the leverage of agility to make minor but swift transformation changes required to ensure the company's long-term sustainable growth.” \nExperts noted that the manpower cuts are precisely the solution that e-commerce firms like Lazada would find useful heading into a future that prioritises long-term profit-making.\nAnd it is usually the high-skilled manpower that is most affected by such cuts, said Assoc Prof Theseira. \n“The catch with that high-skilled manpower is that firms realise they don't actually need everyone for the business to be delivered. \n“If you take out one low skill, low tech worker, fewer parcels get delivered that day; if you take out a business development manager, you may not even notice any impact in the short term — and indeed, firms are betting exactly that,” he said. \nAn article by the New York Times last month detailed how tech retrenchments have entered a “new phase” where firms are cutting workers despite being profitable.\nThis is a bid to “do more with less”. In an environment where capital investments are harder to come by, it is up to the companies to cut staff and focus on fewer products to find a business model that works. \nHowever, despite signs that the e-commerce industry is beginning to generate sustainable revenues, experts are doubtful that the industry in the region will maintain its status quo in the near future. \nThe current state of competition in the e-commerce market in Southeast Asia will likely lead to a “lose-lose” situation for firms, said Prof Loh from NUS.  \n“There’s really so much (e-commerce firms) can do but to go low on prices,” he said, noting that consumers are usually not loyal to any platform and thus will choose the one that offers the most attractive deals and lowest shipping costs. \n“It’s a lose-lose for (the e-commerce firms).” \nAgreeing, Dr Ng from NUS said that even amid a climate where profits are the priority, firms will be reluctant to cut back on offers and discounts as they will fear losing out to their competitors. \n“It's a Catch-22, If I’m (an e-commerce firm) and I skip the next 3.3 sale, for example, and (a competitor) does not, while this might aid the bottom line in the near future, it will make me lose market share in the long term. Is this a good outcome?” \nA “3.3” sale refers to specific sales events that occur on March 3, but can also occur on any date which the number of the day matches that of the month. It is typically chosen by e-commerce firms to offer discounts and attract new customers. \nThis is good news for consumers, said Dr Loh, as they will continue to enjoy low prices and deals at the expense of the e-commerce firms. \n“Because of competition, prices will go down, and you might see many players being withered out of the game.” \nIndeed, due to the fierce competition that still rages in the e-commerce arena here and in the region, experts do not rule out a situation where one big e-commerce firm may bow out. \nThey pointed to a similar situation involving Grab and Uber in the 2010s. The ride-hailing firms were caught in a price battle after entering the Singapore market in 2013, offering various promotions and discounts for commuters and incentives for drivers. \nHowever, Uber eventually decided to exit the Southeast Asian market, and sold its operations to Grab in 2018.\nShould one e-commerce firm end up like Grab and become a dominant player in the industry, it is the customer that will lose out, said Dr Ng.\n“The moment someone bows out, discounts stop… This is a reflection of the venture capital strategy, the moment we dominate the market, we shift gears, focus on profitability, and stop subsidising the consumers.”\nProf Loh added that having a dominant player would also mean that consumers have fewer varieties of online products to choose from, as more companies exit the market. \nAmid the disruptions in the sector, employees at e-commerce firms have to recognise that the industry moves quickly and that no job role should be taken for granted, said human resource (HR) experts. \nMr Adrian Tan, a workplace analyst with 21 years of experience, said that to preempt any potential retrenchment, it is up to employees to look into their firm’s revenue growth, and speak to those familiar with the company’s strategy to find out whether their jobs are at risk. \n“Given today’s context, there is no more iron rice bowl, it is important for (employees) to have a finger on the pulse… seek advice from others on how to interpret (company data) better and if it might have a material impact on their career.”  \nWhile firms such as Lazada are doing their best to train their staff to adapt to new roles in the company in the event of a industry shift, Mr Tan said that there is no guarantee that a firm would want to invest in retraining an employee when it is more efficient to hire new talent with the required skills. \n“We definitely would want to hear the narrative that company is family… but when push comes to shove, your ‘family’ will have no qualms kicking you off the boat in order to make sure the boat can continue to float. \n“It is still better to take ownership of your own training and development,” Mr Tan said.\nAgreeing, Ms Carmen Wee, founder of HR advisory firm Carmen Wee & Associates, said that it is important for prospective employees to have a “plan B” for their careers if they are looking to enter the e-commerce industry. \n“You have to ask yourself, are you able and do you have the network in other industries to navigate to? The tech industry is quite big, so even if you lose your job in e-commerce, are you able to move to another tech firm?”\nShe added that even after landing a role, networking and upskilling within the role is essential. \nFor instance, if a worker were hired for their expertise in user experience, they should think about how this skill can be applicable to other industries and perhaps go for courses in their free time to ensure the skills are transferable. \n“The ability to think beyond the short term is important, given that things are not as predictable as in the past,” said Ms Wee."

            "Article Body": "Each week, TODAY’s long-running Big Read series delves into the trends and issues that matter. This week, we look at how polytechnics have grown more popular as an educational choice over the years and what challenges they face in Singapore's push to place more emphasis on skills instead of grades. This is a shortened version of the full feature, which can be found here.\nSINGAPORE — With a six-point score for his O-Level examination, Mr Matthew Neo had a key to most tertiary educational institutes — so he headed to Republic Polytechnic (RP) to pursue a diploma in sonic arts.\nWhile he could have gone to a top junior college (JC), few batted an eyelid at Mr Neo’s school of choice.\nNow 19, the second-year student told TODAY: “I am interested in working in audio, and the course is exclusive to RP.\n“Nobody questioned my decision... I have the responsibility to take charge of my own learning, and (my parents) are supportive and want me to succeed.”\nMr Neo said choosing to study in a polytechnic — with its slew of industry talks, projects with real-world applications and an upcoming internship — instead of a JC was the right choice for him.\nLikewise, National University of Singapore undergraduate Abdul Qayyum described the three years he spent studying for a diploma in law and management at Temasek Polytechnic (TP) as very enriching as he became “more mature and developed a lot holistically”.\nMr Abdul too had the option to go to a junior college but opted to pursue a diploma. Several teachers in his secondary school had supported his choice, he recalled.\nWith polytechnics having long shed their past as educational institutions for students who could not enter JCs, a growing number of secondary school students are opting to take the polytechnic route in their education journey.\nEach year, some 20,000 students enrol into Singapore's five polytechnics, including many who chose a polytechnic as their first choice even though they were also eligible for JC.\nEducation experts and practitioners cited several factors for how polytechnics have transformed their image over the decades.\nThese include better outreach programmes to students and diversification in courses to cover areas such as logistics, tourism and hospitality, creative design and legal studies.\nClose ties with the industry, hands-on learning and the chance to pick up skills for the workforce have also made youths keen to pursue higher education in a polytechnic.\nThe educational roles played by polytechnics are particularly relevant to Singapore's push to place more emphasis on skills instead of grades. \nHuman resource managers, current and former polytechnic students and education experts raise some challenges polytechnics face.\nThis includes the lower starting pay and the widening pay gap between between polytechnic and university graduates.\nIn a written response to a parliamentary question in February last year, Education Minister Chan Chun Sing revealed that the median starting salary gap between university and polytechnic graduates increased by S$200 between 2016 and 2021. \nAccording to the 2023 Joint Polytechnic Graduate Employment Survey, the median gross monthly salary for fresh and post-National Service (NS) polytechnic graduates was S$2,800, up from S$2,600 in 2022. \nWhile there is no data available for graduates of autonomous universities in 2023, data from a similar study in 2022 found university graduates had a median gross monthly salary of S$4,200 — 62 per cent higher than their polytechnic counterparts.\nThe surveys conducted in 2010 found university graduates had a median gross monthly salary of S$2,900, 45 per cent higher than post-National Service polytechnic graduates’ monthly salary of S$2,000.\nIn his reply, Mr Chan said that the widening gap was caused by several factors, such as the relative demand and supply of manpower, and differences in productivity between jobs and sectors that different groups of graduates enter.\n“While some differences are understandable, it is important that we ensure these differences do not widen significantly over individuals’ lifetimes. Singaporeans must feel that there are opportunities to progress over their career regardless of differences in starting points,” said Mr Chan.\nChief executive officer of recruitment agency Reeracoen, Mr Kenji Naito, added that diplomas being valued less than degrees “might be rooted in historical biases towards traditional educational pathways”.\n“As industries evolve, there is a growing acknowledgement of the effectiveness of polytechnic education in producing skilled professionals. It may take time for these perceptions to fully shift, but the trend is moving towards recognising skills irrespective of the educational background,” said Mr Naito.\nAnother challenge that polytechnic graduates face is the speed at which skills become obsolete.\nMr Patrick Tay, Member of Parliament for Pioneer Single Member Constituency and chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee for education, said that polytechnics need to ensure “speed to market” for their programmes, curriculum and attachments.\nThis is because the “half-life of skills is shortening” and “the speed of market disruptions and change of skills in demand is increasing”, added Mr Tay.\nArtificial intelligence, in particular, poses a challenge for polytechnics as there are several questions about how educational institutions and their students can stay ahead of advancements while using it responsibly and ethically, said Dr N Varaprasad, partner and principal consultant at Singapore Education Consulting Group.\nDr Varaprasad was also the founding principal and chief executive officer of Temasek Polytechnic (TP) in 1990.\nAs the workplace grapples with rapidly changing technology and creative disruption, polytechnics need to continuously enhance their partnerships and engagement with industry stakeholders, such as companies, said human resource and education experts.\nIn response to TODAY's queries, the Ministry of Education (MOE) said that the five polytechnics will continue to \"maintain close partnerships with industry partners through co-development of course content, internships, and work attachment opportunities, to ensure that our students are equipped with the most updated knowledge and skills to thrive in the future economy\".\nThe ministry added that it is reviewing admissions into polytechnic year one to \"better recognise the different subject levels taken by students\".\nIt has also expanded the Polytechnic Foundation Programme, allowing more students to take it up. MOE will be removing the current stream-based admission — which limits the programme to Normal (Academic) students — in the academic year of 2028.\nThe polytechnics told TODAY that they are employing a variety of strategies to keep their curriculum up-to-date and to enhance the value of a diploma.\nA key plank of their strategies is to double down on what has worked for them — industry partnerships.\nNanyang Polytechnic, for one, has revamped its curriculum with a \"Professional Competency Model\" where students focus on acquiring specific skills and knowledge relevant to real-world tasks based on industry knowledge and partnerships.\nThree of its six schools will have its curriculum based on its model when the new academic year starts in April, said Mr Russell Chan, its principal and chief executive officer.\n\"The curricula are agile, responsive to industry changes, and provide our students with the latest skills and knowledge. And our industry-relevant training is informed by real industry intelligence and needs, coupled with having access to proprietary learning materials from top companies,\" he told TODAY.\nIndustry partners also play a key role in Republic Polytechnic's enhancement of its hospitality programme.\nIts principal and chief executive officer Jeanne Liew told TODAY it has launched its Talent Advancement Programme to equip hospitality students with the right skills in collaboration with 16 businesses in the events, financial services and hospitality sectors.\nStudents who get into the programme in their second year of studies will get assigned to a mentor and participate in an early work immersion that can range from part-time roles during weekends to full-time positions during semester breaks.\nThey then take part in a 40-week structured internship, where students rotate across multiple roles to \"broaden their competencies and enhance life skills\".\nTo ensure their graduates remain relevant as skills evolve at a quicker pace, several polytechnic leaders like Mr Soh Wai Wah, principal and chief executive officer of Singapore Polytechnic (SP), said Continuing Education and Training is crucial.\nAcknowledging that adults have different learning needs, SP has micro-credentials for adults to learn from bite-sized modules that can be stacked for higher-level recognition.\nTo help adults acquire job-relevant skills at a comfortable pace amidst their busy schedule, about 30 per cent of its Continuing Education and Training programmes are held online for flexible learning, he added.\nOn the artificial intelligence (AI) front, Ms Anita Kuan, deputy principal of TP, said the school has developed a digitalisation plan and launched an AI studio to equip its design school students with skills in Generative AI.\n\"The studio offers a vibrant, constantly evolving space for students to delve into the convergence of design and technology. By introducing students to the dynamic world of AI-assisted creativity, TP aims to nurture not just designers, but future innovators who are well-equipped to lead in the ever-evolving design landscape,\" she said.\nFreshmen in the polytechnic's business school will also be required to learn how to use AI effectively this year onwards, she added.\nFor Mr Neo, the sonic arts student, his future after his diploma is still uncertain. He plans to use his time during National Service to decide between pursuing a degree or securing work.\n“I have the luxury of choice since my diploma is arts-based and most employers are looking for experience, not just academic credentials,” he said.\n“So who knows? I will wait until I have to make a decision.”"

            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — With a six-point score for his O-Level examination, Mr Matthew Neo had a key to most tertiary educational institutes — so he headed to Republic Polytechnic (RP) to pursue a diploma in sonic arts.\nWhile he could have gone to a top junior college (JC), few batted an eyelid at Mr Neo’s school of choice.\nNow 19, the second-year student told TODAY: “I am interested in working in audio, and the course is exclusive to RP.\n“Nobody questioned my decision... I have the responsibility to take charge of my own learning, and (my parents) are supportive and want me to succeed.”\nMr Neo said choosing to study in a polytechnic — with its slew of industry talks, projects with real-world applications and an upcoming internship — instead of a JC was the right choice for him.\nLikewise, National University of Singapore (NUS) undergraduate Abdul Qayyum described the three years he spent studying for a diploma in law and management at Temasek Polytechnic (TP) as very enriching as he became “more mature and developed a lot holistically”.\nMr Abdul too had the option to go to a junior college but opted to pursue a diploma. Several teachers in his secondary school had supported his choice, he recalled.\n“Some teachers felt that many of us were better suited in polytechnics and did not have the necessary ‘rigour’ for the junior college curriculum and A-Level examinations,” said Mr Abdul.\n“This likely stemmed out of care and concern for us as at that time, we often heard of quite a few of our seniors who went to JC who withdrew or did not do well for A-Levels.”\nWhile he had several job opportunities with his diploma, Mr Abdul decided to further his education upon graduation because he felt the average starting salary “did not seem sufficient” and that the positions offered lacked career progression opportunities.\nThose with a diploma in law cannot be called to the Bar without a recognised law degree, but can work as paralegals.\nWith polytechnics having long shed their past as educational institutions for students who could not enter JCs, a growing number of secondary school students are opting to take the polytechnic route in their education journey.\nOn Feb 1, 19,200 Secondary Four and Five students who sat for their O-Level and N-Level examinations in 2023 received their Joint Admissions Exercise results. About 52 per cent, or 10,000 students, were posted to a polytechnic.\nAbout 52 per cent of the cohort had chosen a polytechnic as their first choice, of which 40 per cent were also eligible for JC.\nIncluding all other pathways such as early admission exercises, more than 20,000 students enrol into Singapore's five polytechnics each year.\nEducation experts and the five polytechnics — Singapore Polytechnic (SP), Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP), TP, Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP) and RP — credit the polytechnics’ ever-growing popularity to industry collaboration and the focus on equipping students with skills.\nYet, the salary gap between university and polytechnic graduates has continued to widen. \nIn a written response to a parliamentary question in February last year, Education Minister Chan Chun Sing revealed that the median starting salary gap between university and polytechnic graduates increased by S$200 between 2016 and 2021. \nAccording to the 2023 Joint Polytechnic Graduate Employment Survey, the median gross monthly salary for fresh and post-National Service polytechnic graduates was S$2,800, up from S$2,600 in 2022. \nWhile there is no data available for graduates of autonomous universities in 2023, data from a similar study in 2022 found university graduates had a median gross monthly salary of S$4,200 — 62 per cent higher than their polytechnic counterparts.\nThe surveys conducted in 2010 found university graduates had a median gross monthly salary of S$2,900, 45 per cent higher than post-National Service (NS) polytechnic graduates’ monthly salary of S$2,000.\nMr Chan said in his parliamentary reply that the widening gap was caused by several factors, such as the relative demand and supply of manpower, and differences in productivity between jobs and sectors that different groups of graduates enter.\n“While some differences are understandable, it is important that we ensure these differences do not widen significantly over individuals’ lifetimes. Singaporeans must feel that there are opportunities to progress over their career regardless of differences in starting points,” said Mr Chan.\nWith polytechnics playing a key role in Singapore's push to place more emphasis on skills instead of grades, TODAY looks at their evolution, what contributed to their popularity and what the future of these institutions will look like. \nPolytechnics originated as vocational institutions to establish a solid foundation for essential workplace skills, said Dr Betsy Ng, an education research scientist at the Centre for Research in Pedagogy and Practice at the National Institute of Education.\nSingapore’s first poly, SP, was established in 1954 to produce skilled technicians to support the country’s move towards industrialisation after World War II.\nNine years later, Ngee Ann College — now known as NP — was established by the Ngee Ann Kongsi, before being renamed Ngee Ann Technical College after it was taken over by the Government.\nAs more foreign investments poured into Singapore, there was a growing demand for skilled technicians to meet the demands of multinational corporations looking to set up shop here. Hence, SP and NP were expanded to take in more students.\nDespite this, the polytechnics faced a hurdle — secondary students were not applying to join them.\nDr N Varaprasad, partner and principal consultant at Singapore Education Consulting Group, recalled that SP struggled as it had an engineering bias.\nBut what helped attract more students to polytechnics was SP’s outreach programme, said Dr Varaprasad, who was its deputy principal from 1985 to 1990.\n“We kickstarted a schools outreach programme, bringing in busloads of secondary school students to see the tech marvels — such as the largest CAD-CAM set up in the world and the most advanced marine simulator in Asia — open houses with cheerleaders, establishing links with school principals and putting up posters in their schools,” he told TODAY.\nA CAD-CAM is a powerful computer that integrates computer-aided design and manufacturing.\nRepositioning graduates as technologists, rather than a technician, also helped shift the tide.\nWith a growing number of applicants, the Government decided to establish Singapore’s third polytechnic, TP, in 1990.\nDr Varaprasad then became its founding principal and chief executive officer.\n“In the 90s, with the establishment of TP, the whole image of a polytechnic as a technical institution with only hard skills changed,” he said, crediting the school’s diversification to provide diplomas in service industries such as logistics, tourism and hospitality, creative design and legal studies.\n“The presence of a third poly in the landscape made for a more competitive landscape in polytechnic education.”\nAdding to the competition was the founding of NYP in 1992 and RP in 2002.\n“I believe that this resulted in a heightened awareness of polytechnic education as each polytechnic went on its own outreach blitz and came up with innovations, such as TP's early admission programme based on school preliminary (examination) results, problem-based learning, and character education,” added Dr Varaprasad.\nMr Russell Chan, principal and chief executive officer of NYP, said that the quantum leap for the polytechnic was the increased involvement of companies.\n\"From just advising and reviewing our curriculum, to taking an active role in shaping the skills that the students learn, and in some cases co-teaching and co-certifying and co-developing solution for business application,\" he said.\n\"This is why you are seeing NYP moving quickly to jointly explore, and even adopt, with industry emerging technologies, like virtual production, AI (artificial intelligence), and alternative protein sources.\"\nDr Ng, the education research scientist, added: “Over the past five to six decades, the established polytechnics have demonstrated the success of numerous graduates, many of whom have achieved advanced standing in universities and outperformed their peers.\n“These achievements contribute to dispelling any negative perceptions that may have once surrounded polytechnics.”\nOne of the biggest changes 56-year-old Des Sim has seen in polytechnics is the structure of their modules.\n“When I was a student, there were nine subjects that you did throughout a year,” said Mr Sim, who graduated with a diploma in mechatronics from NP in 1990 and is now a fabrication project manager.\n“But my son has more freedom in choosing what he wants to study, and he has different subjects each academic term instead of a fixed schedule.”\nHe added that his school holidays were often spent on workshops and practical lessons to learn how to use highly specialised equipment. Now, these lessons are part of the curriculum during the term, and the facilities “are so much more advanced”, said Mr Sim. His son graduated from NYP with a diploma in digital visual effects.\nTo enhance the education for students of the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) and polytechnics, the Government has conducted several reviews over the years.\nThe most recent was in 2021, when the Review on Opportunities and Pathways in Applied Education led by Second Minister for Education Dr Maliki Osman, made six recommendations. They include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Mr Sim, the main draw to enter polytechnic was the choice to further his studies or enter the working world after graduation.\n“Back then, if you wanted to go into a local university like NUS or NTU (Nanyang Technological University), you needed to be at the top of your cohort. But you could also pursue a degree overseas,” he recalled.\nAccording to MOE, over the last few years, one in three fresh polytechnic graduates matriculated into autonomous universities — namely NUS, NTU, Singapore Management University, Singapore University of Social Sciences, Singapore Institute of Technology and Singapore University of Technology and Design.\nAnother major attraction was the practical skills that polytechnic equips students with, several students told TODAY.\n“When I compare my studies to my friends who chose to enter JC, I feel like I have more time and what I learn is more practical,” said Mr Neo, referring to the hands-on approach and opportunities to have a taste of how the skills apply in the working world.\n“I wouldn’t say poly is easier. It’s more self-directed, and you have to take charge of your own learning… I would rather not deal with the stress and mugging near examination periods in JCs.”\nChief executive officer of recruitment agency Reeracoen, Mr Kenji Naito, said that many industries, particularly in financial technology and technology, emphasise practical abilities and hands-on experience.\n“This shift is driven by the need for employees who can adapt quickly to technological advancements and contribute effectively to the evolving demands of their roles.”\nThe growing emphasis on skills in job hiring has also resulted in a growing number of companies recognising polytechnic graduates.\n“As industries continue to transform, embracing diverse educational pathways and valuing skills will be crucial for fostering a resilient and adaptable workforce,” said Mr Naito on the growing attractiveness of polytechnic graduates for businesses.\nIncreasing efforts to allow secondary school students to explore potential education and career paths have also aided the polytechnics’ cause.\nMr Patrick Tay, Member of Parliament (MP) for Pioneer Single Member Constituency, said: “More O-Level school leavers today choose the polytechnic route because they are clear what they want to do.”\nThe chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee for education added that with the polytechnic curriculum being highly relevant to working world needs, alongside internship opportunities locally and overseas, such institutions have become increasingly attractive.\nThis is the case for 24-year-old Jeremy Soh, partner and head of business development at AI startup Gignite.\nWhile pursuing a diploma in financial informatics at NP, Mr Soh had the opportunity to participate in various hackathons and present his business idea at the Singapore Fintech Festival, allowing him to build connections with people in the fintech space.\nHe also managed to land a six-month internship in London through an overseas internship programme at NP to gain entrepreneurship experience.\nHis course has been renamed to Diploma in Data Science, and he graduated in 2019.\nThe biggest draw to polytechnic for him was the freedom and ability to pursue more than just studies. As someone who had dreamt of being an entrepreneur, having time to chase his dream was one reason he chose to enter a polytechnic.\nLikewise, companies collaborate with polytechics to tap potential hires and meet their manpower needs.\nMr Ernest Phang, managing director of group human resources at OCBC, said: “Polytechnic talents are technically competent and can operate well in an interdisciplinary environment, thanks to the industry-oriented training that they receive.\n“With a different perspective, they bring in fresh insights which often leads to more innovation and creative ideas.”\nThrough its year-long internship programme, OCBC Ignite, the bank allows students from NP — and from March, TP students — to work on projects in data visualisation, machine learning, cloud technologies and mobile app development among others.\n“Each internship is curated to the student’s interests and area of study, with mentors attached to the students,” said Mr Phang.\n“Completing the internship could also lead to full-time employment with the bank as we seek to boost our technology bench strength.”\nOn the hospitality front, Marina Bay Sands (MBS) also has partnered with all five polytechnics through its US$1 million (S$1.3 million) Sands Hospitality Scholarship Programme.\nIt also provides internships in various roles at the integrated resort, which give students “valuable exposure to the industry”, said Ms Chan Yit Foon, senior vice-president of human resources at MBS.\nShe added that this allows MBS to build “a strong pipeline of local hospitality talent” and for students to start their careers with MBS.\nHowever, not everything is hunky-dory for polytechnics.\nNUS undergraduate Abdul said polytechnic students may face ceilings when it comes to job progression, as university degrees are often more valued.\nHe noted that the lower starting pay and widening pay gap between polytechnic and university graduates are also a pain point for polytechnic graduates.\nOn this point, Mr Jeffrey Ng, regional director at human resource firm Michael Page Singapore, said academic qualifications \"lay the groundwork for professional success\".\nThis is because academia instils \"a robust foundation of knowledge, critical thinking, and perspective that is invaluable throughout one's career trajectory”, Mr Ng said.\nHowever, this does not mean skills are not valued.\n“While entry-level positions may prioritise academic credentials due to a lack of professional experience, there's a discernible shift that occurs once a candidate crosses the threshold of three years in the industry,\" said Mr Ng.\n“At that juncture, it becomes increasingly evident that the skills they have honed on the job are the real drivers of professional advancement.”\nMr Naito of Reeracoen said that diplomas being valued less than degrees “might be rooted in historical biases towards traditional educational pathways”.\n“As industries evolve, there is a growing acknowledgement of the effectiveness of polytechnic education in producing skilled professionals. It may take time for these perceptions to fully shift, but the trend is moving towards recognising skills irrespective of the educational background,” said Mr Naito.\nWhile the skills-centric approach in hiring may benefit diploma holders, polytechnic graduates told TODAY that they face a never-ending challenge to ensure their skills remain relevant.\nFor Mr Soh of AI startup Gignite, advancements in technology meant some things he learnt during his studies could become obsolete in \"days and months\".\nTo ensure he was still up to date with the latest skills, he would take on his own tech projects during his free time while serving National Service and by keeping in contact with people in the fintech industry that he met during his studies at NP.\nWhile NP taught him the foundations and equipped with \"the mindset to be focused, motivated and competitive\", the evolving skills can be a challenge for other graduates to keep up.\nMr Tay, the MP who is also the assistant secretary-general of the National Trades Union Congress, added that polytechnics need to ensure “speed to market” for their programmes, curriculum and attachments.\nThis is because the “half-life of skills is shortening” and “the speed of market disruptions and change of skills in demand is increasing”, said Mr Tay.\nAI, in particular, poses a challenge for polytechnics as there are several questions about how educational institutions and their students can stay ahead of advancements while using it responsibly and ethically, added Dr Varaprasad.\nAs the workplace grapples with rapidly changing technology and creative disruption, polytechnics need to continuously enhance their partnerships and engagement with industry stakeholders, such as companies, said HR and education experts.\nDr Ng of the National Institute of Education, for one, suggested that polytechnics should look into expanding apprenticeship training for students.\nWhile there are such programmes, they are often for those with good academic results, she noted.\n“Being an apprentice is also about learning skills-based employment and other soft skills that are important to the inexperienced poly students.”\nMr Soh, the NP graduate working in AI startup Gignite, said that polytechnics need to \"remain focused\" on what has worked for them  — working with industry partners and showcasing how the skills learnt in the classroom apply in the working world.\n\"This gets students excited to learn, and will always benefit students even after graduating,\" he said.\nOn this, the Ministry of Education (MOE) said that the five polytechnics will continue to \"maintain close partnerships with industry partners through co-development of course content, internships, and work attachment opportunities, to ensure that our students are equipped with the most updated knowledge and skills to thrive in the future economy\".\nIn responding to TODAY's queries, the ministry added that it is reviewing admissions into polytechnic year one to \"better recognise the different subject levels taken by students\".\nIt has also expanded the Polytechnic Foundation Programme, allowing more students to take it up. MOE will be removing the current stream-based admission — which limits the programme to Normal (Academic) students — in the academic year of 2028.\nThe polytechnics told TODAY that they are employing a variety of strategies to keep their curriculum up-to-date and to enhance the value of a diploma.\nA key plank of their efforts is doubling down on what has worked for them — industry partnerships.\nNYP, for one, has revamped its curriculum with a \"Professional Competency Model\" where students focus on acquiring specific skills and knowledge relevant to real-world tasks based on industry knowledge and partnerships.\nThree of its six schools will have its curriculum based on its model when the new academic year starts in April, said Mr Chan of NYP.\n\"The curricula are agile, responsive to industry changes, and provide our students with the latest skills and knowledge. And our industry-relevant training is informed by real industry intelligence and needs, coupled with having access to proprietary learning materials from top companies,\" he told TODAY.\nIndustry partners also play a key role in RP's enhancement of its hospitality programme.\nIts principal and chief executive officer Jeanne Liew told TODAY it has launched its Talent Advancement Programme to equip hospitality students with the right skills in collaboration with 16 businesses in the events, financial services and hospitality sectors.\nStudents who get into the programme in their second year of studies will be assigned to a mentor and participate in an early work immersion that can range from part-time roles during weekends to full-time positions during semester breaks.\nThey then take part in a 40-week structured internship, where students rotate across multiple roles to \"broaden their competencies and enhance life skills\".\n\"Recognising the specialised skillsets and extensive experience gained through the Talent Advancement Programme, School of Hospitality graduates may receive offers of bond-free, full-time employment at a higher position, along with up to 10 per cent additional remuneration, from their internship companies,\" added Ms Liew.\nTo ensure their graduates remain relevant as skills evolve at a quicker pace, several polytechnic leaders like Mr Soh Wai Wah, principal and chief executive officer of SP, said Continuing Education and Training is crucial.\nAcknowledging that adults have different learning needs, SP has micro-credentials for adults to learn from bite-sized modules that can be stacked for higher-level recognition.\nTo help adults acquire job-relevant skills at a comfortable pace amid their busy schedules, about 30 per cent of its Continuing Education and Training programmes are held online for flexible learning, he added.\nOn the AI front, Ms Anita Kuan, deputy principal of TP, said the school has developed a digitalisation plan and launched an AI studio to equip its design school students with skills in Generative AI.\n\"The studio offers a vibrant, constantly evolving space for students to delve into the convergence of design and technology. By introducing students to the dynamic world of AI-assisted creativity, TP aims to nurture not just designers, but future innovators who are well-equipped to lead in the ever-evolving design landscape,\" she said.\nFreshmen in the polytechnic's business school will also be required to learn how to use AI effectively this year onwards, she added.\nSimilarly at NP, students across the polytechnic have been required to take a module that incorporates generative AI that is related to their course.\n\"Aimed at enabling students to use generative AI tools to assist them in their learning or problem-solving, the lessons will also give them the opportunity to reflect on the use of such technologies, fostering a mindset that values the learning process as much as outcomes,\" said NP's senior director of technology, innovation and entrepreneurship Patrice Choong.\nThe school has also collaborated with cloud computing company Amazon Web Services to develop AI talents through a new specialisation in its data science course,\nFor Mr Neo, the sonic arts student, his future after his diploma is still uncertain. He plans to use his time during National Service to decide between pursuing a degree or securing work.\n“I have the luxury of choice since my diploma is arts-based and most employers are looking for experience, not just academic credentials,” he said.\n“So who knows?

            "Article Summary": "Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have risen and fall quickly in value over the span of two years.\nThe rise was driven by various factors such as easy money due to low interest rates while the collapse of some cryptocurrency exchanges was a reason for NFTs' decline .\nHowever, with fewer speculators today, there are suggestions that NFTs could be making a comeback.\nIndustry players are cautiously hoping that NFT prices will rise again, albeit to less extremes.\nThey also express confidence in the wide applicability of the technology beyond that as an investment vehicle",
            "Article Body": "Each week, TODAY’s long-running Big Read series delves into the trends and issues that matter. This week, we look at the rapid rise and fall of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), whether they are due for a comeback and what are the applications of these token outside of investment. This is a shortened version of the full feature, which can be found here.\nSINGAPORE — Within just two years, the world had seen the value and trading volume of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) rising rapidly, before tumbling almost just as quickly.\nIn September 2021, a team of Singaporeans which included then third-year Nanyang Technological University (NTU) student Marc Yap, made headlines for selling all 3,876 units of their NFT digital trading cards, dubbed the Dark Zodiac collection, in an hour.\nThe digital cards fetched about S$1.4 million in cryptocurrency, which was split among the project partners, it surprised Mr Yap, who was experimenting with NFTs for the first time. \n“I really didn’t expect such a good outcome … I thought it had about 40 to 50 per cent chance of succeeding,” said Mr Yap, who was the design director for the project.\nAmid the craze, companies such as Nike, Coca Cola, McDonald's also hopped onto the bandwagon, in a bid to find new ways to attract younger consumers. \nBut the bubble burst within months.\nMr Yap, now 29, told TODAY that his involvement in NFTs soon after Dark Zodiac was not as fruitful and resulted in “a couple of thousands (of dollars) in losses”, somewhat reflective of the market’s change in fortune.\nTrading volume for NFT plunged to US$11.8 billion (S$15.9 billion) in 2023, down from US$26.3 billion the year before, according to an industry report by independent cryptocurrency data aggregator CoinGecko.\nAnother report by crypto news site dappGambl in September last year found that of 73,257 NFT collections it analysed, 69,795 of them have a market cap of 0 Ether (ETH) — referring to the cryptocurrency commonly used to transact such tokens.\nThis downturn resulted in many media reports comparing it to the Dutch “tulip mania” of the 1630s. Back then, prices of tulip bulbs soared over a few years, to the point where they equalled that of a mansion, according to some estimates, before crashing.\nFor NFTs, the factors behind the fall in prices from their stratospheric levels were aplenty, from the crash of cryptocurrencies, which are used to buy these digital tokens, to the cooling down of the initial euphoria, business experts and industry players told TODAY. \nBut there may still be life yet in NFTs, with media reports in recent months discussing their possible resurgence.\nFor example, recent reports from business publication Forbes and crypto industry news site Coindesk highlighted that major companies and brands are experimenting with NFTs as digital collectibles, while buyers of some NFTs are also given real-world products or benefits.\nMeanwhile, a museum in Paris sold two Van Gogh-inspired NFTs for US$2.5 million in October 2023, about a year after the end of the NFTs’ bull run.\nIn Singapore last year, a fast-food restaurant and a magazine were giving away NFTs as part of their brand experience, also after the bull run.\nTODAY’s interviews with those familiar or involved with NFTs reflected a sense of measured confidence in these tokens’ future. \nWhile prices might not reach the lofty heights seen in 2021 or 2022, these tokens could still see an appreciation in value, especially among the projects that have managed to survive the bear market and are backed by teams with active plans on providing value to token holders.\nIt is also helpful that some speculators who had jumped in amid the initial novelty and hype of NFTs have been “flushed out”, said some industry players.

            "Article Summary": "Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have risen and fall quickly in value over the span of two years.\nThe rise was driven by various factors such as easy money due to low interest rates while the collapse of some cryptocurrency exchanges was a reason for NFTs' decline .\nHowever, with fewer speculators today, there are suggestions that NFTs could be making a comeback.\nIndustry players are cautiously hoping that NFT prices will rise again, albeit to less extremes.\nThey also express confidence in the wide applicability of the technology beyond that as an investment vehicle.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n",
            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — Within just two years, the world had seen the value and trading volume of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) rising rapidly, before tumbling almost just as quickly.\nAmong the notable developments at the early stages of the bull run was when Christie’s auction house in March 2021 sold an NFT of a digital collage by artist Beeple for US$69.3 million (S$92.9 million) worth of cryptocurrency — the highest price for an NFT at that time — to a Singapore-based investor.\n\nBarely months later in September, a team of Singaporeans which included then third-year Nanyang Technological University (NTU) student Marc Yap, made headlines for selling all 3,876 units of their NFT digital trading cards, dubbed the Dark Zodiac collection, in an hour.\nWhile these digital cards fetched a lower price of about S$1.4 million in cryptocurrency, which was split among the project partners, it still surprised Mr Yap, who was experimenting with NFTs for his first time. \n“I really didn’t expect such a good outcome … I thought it had about 40 to 50 per cent chance of succeeding,” said Mr Yap, who was the design director for the project.\nAmid the craze, companies such as Nike, Coca Cola, McDonald's also hopped onto the bandwagon, in a bid to find new ways to attract younger consumers. \nBut the bubble burst within months.\nMr Yap, now 29, told TODAY that his involvement in NFTs soon after Dark Zodiac was not as fruitful and resulted in “a couple of thousands (of dollars) in losses”, somewhat reflective of the market’s change in fortune.\nTrading volume for NFTs plunged to US$11.8 billion in 2023, down from US$26.3 billion the year before, according to an industry report by independent cryptocurrency data aggregator CoinGecko.\nAnother report by crypto news site dappGambl in September last year found that of 73,257 NFT collections it analysed, 69,795 of them have a market cap of 0 Ether (ETH) — referring to the cryptocurrency commonly used to transact such tokens.\nThis downturn resulted in many media reports comparing it to the Dutch “tulip mania” of the 1630s. Back then, prices of tulip bulbs soared over a few years, to the point where they equalled that of a mansion, according to some estimates, before crashing.\nWhen prices of NFTs crashed, some celebrities such as Justin Bieber, Madonna, Paris Hilton and Jimmy Fallon who were seen as promoters fuelling the craze, were named in a class action suit by investors claiming they were misled into buying the collectibles by the celebrities.\nFor NFTs, the factors behind the fall in prices from their stratospheric levels were aplenty, from the crash of cryptocurrencies, which are used to buy these digital tokens, to the cooling down of the initial euphoria, business experts and industry players told TODAY. \nBut there may still be life yet in NFTs, with media reports in recent months discussing their possible resurgence.\nFor example, recent reports from business publication Forbes and crypto industry news site Coindesk highlighted that major companies and brands are experimenting with NFTs as digital collectibles, while buyers of some NFTs are also given real-world products or benefits.\nMeanwhile, a museum in Paris sold two Van Gogh-inspired NFTs for US$2.5 million in October 2023, about a year after the end of the NFTs’ bull run.\nLast year, a fast-food restaurant and a magazine in Singapore were giving away NFTs as part of their brand experience, also after the bull run.\nTODAY’s interviews with those familiar or involved with NFTs reflected a sense of measured confidence in these tokens’ future. \nWhile prices might not reach the lofty heights seen in 2021 or 2022, these tokens could still see an appreciation in value, especially among the projects that have managed to survive the bear market and are backed by teams with active plans on providing value to token holders.\nIt is also helpful that some speculators who had jumped in amid the initial novelty and hype of NFTs have been “flushed out”, said some industry players. A reduction in speculative activities would further stabilise NFTs in the long run, they added.\nBeyond trading, the technology underpinning NFTs can have widespread use too, the industry players said, not least in the digital art space.\nMr Bobby Lim, who has been investing in cryptocurrencies since about 2018, said he was exposed to investing in NFTs in early 2020 at the suggestion of his friend, who said that “a lot of people have earned a lot of money from this”.\nDespite some early success, the 30-year-old said his NFT collection now has seen S$10,000 in actual loss. This is on top of S$20,000 of paper loss from NFT assets which have depreciated in value, but he is still holding on to.\nFor 30-year-old Gautham Rajadanran, he began trading NFTs in November 2021. As of now, he has just “broken even” on his investments.\nWhile little data on NFT trading activities among Singaporeans is available, those involved in the market generally observed that a noticeable number of people in their network had left since the end of the bull run, after suffering losses from the crypto and NFT downturn.\n“About six in 10 of my friends have left the space completely, after experiencing some losses,” said Mr Lim.\nMr Clement Chia, co-founder of Imaginary Ones company and NFT project, said there was a silver lining to the crash.\n“A lot of bad projects actually got flushed out of the system. People that were here just to cash grab, they're out of the system,” he said.\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique tokens that exist on a decentralised, digital public ledger called a blockchain.\nNFTs cannot be replicated or changed, but can be transferred and therefore sellable and tradable. \nOne would typically need to use a digital currency called cryptocurrency to buy an NFT. \n\nBoth Mr Lim and Mr Gautham are still holding on to some NFTs, along with the hope that the value of these assets will rise high enough to generate returns.\nThey pointed to how creators of some NFT collections have survived the bear market and actively rolled out plans to provide real benefits to token holders, as well as the entry of brands and personalities into the scene after the bull run, as factors driving their hopes of an NFT comeback.\nFor instance, Mr Lim’s last NFT purchase was in late 2022 — from the Donald Trump digital trading card collection. That series was launched in December that year, with 45,000 units up for grabs and sold out within a day.\nIn 2023, the former United States president, who has set his sights on returning to the Oval Office next year, doubled down on his involvement in NFTs by launching yet another set of trading cards.\nMr Lim believes that when it comes to NFTs, “where there’s a lot of attention, that’s where the value will be”.\n“So whenever Trump wins an election in a state, for example, that’s where the attention will go to, and the price will naturally correlate,” he said.\nThree months ago on Oct 26, 2023, for example, the floor price of the NFT was 0.11189 ETH. As of Friday (Jan 26), the floor price was 0.30499 ETH (S$923.49).\nMr Lim said improving macroeconomic conditions, such as the expected cuts in interest rates by the US Federal Reserve and the reigning in of inflation globally, would improve overall investor sentiments, too.\nSingapore brick-and-mortar brands, too, are getting involved in NFTs. Most of these businesses use NFTs as a marketing tool, with some having jumped on the bandwagon at the height of the hype.\nFashion brand Love, Bonito collaborated with a digital artist in January 2022 to launch an NFT dubbed Tiger Bloom, with part of the funds raised channelled to charity.\nPost-hype, Vogue Singapore magazine launched Love Chain NFTs in February 2023, which gave holders access to its metaverse.\nMcDonald’s Singapore launched free NFTs of its Grimace characters in August 2023, promising exclusive perks for holders, without giving details.\nMs Bhavna Monga from EY-Parthenon, the global strategy consulting arm of professional services firm EY, said: “Some consumer products and retail businesses are looking to explore the usage of NFTs as a means to engage an increasingly digital-oriented customer base. Some enterprises integrate NFTs into their marketing strategy, while others design business models around them.”\n“This heightened involvement has the potential to make NFTs more mainstream,” added Ms Bhavna, who is partner for financial services strategy and transactions at the firm.\nAgreeing, Mr Jaye Foo, a council member of the Bored Ape Singapore Club, a community of NFT enthusiasts that support the Bored Ape NFT collection, added: “These traditional Web 2.0 brands have a large following. \n\"And so naturally, if you think of the following for these brands buying into their NFTs, it will help grow the NFT market, but it's going to take time.”\nWeb 2.0 refers to the current iteration of the internet, while web 3.0 refers to a future one characterised by greater openness and decentralisation. \nAt the same time, NFT-native brands are also creating “phygital” offerings, where a physical product or experience comes with a related NFT in the digital space.\nIn Singapore, NFT collection Imaginary Ones was sold out four minutes after it was launched in April 2022, with a price range of 0.6 ETH to 1.5 ETH.\nAs of Friday, the floor price is 1.19 ETH.\nMr Chia said this was in part due to how Imaginary Ones continued to build itself up even during the bearish market period, by forming collaborations with major brands like fashion designer Hugo Boss and hotel group Shangri-La, and launching games.\n“So now that the bull is somewhat coming back, people start to realise that the projects that have stayed throughout and build themselves up during this time — they start to appreciate these projects more, and that contributes to the price.”\nAt the international level, Pudgy Penguin, launched in July 2021 for 0.03 ETH, is another example of an NFT that has grown its value despite the market fluctuation. Its floor price on Friday morning was 18.53 ETH.\nMr Coby Lim, who is part of the Singapore Community's Core Pudgy Penguin contributor team — essentially a group of people who help plan events relating to the NFT — pointed to the efforts put into building the brand equity for the NFT.\nFor example, the project launched plushies in giant stores all over the US and managed to sell over US$500,000 worth of the toys on the first two days. There is also the Pudgy World metaverse that NFT holders can access.\n“(With the toy launch, for example), I can kind of put a number to how popular this Pudgy Penguin is,” said Mr Lim, who is also lead trader for spot over-the-counter at crypto firm blockchain.com.\nThis is in contrast to the situation at the early part of the NFT frenzy, where some tokens have nothing to show for their value and are purely driven by speculation, he said.\n“Some go up to seven figures, with celebrities just jumping into it purely based on the notion that they have money to throw, and they can just anyhow spent seven figures on it.” \nWhile NFTs may yet stage a comeback sans the irrational exuberance, what caused their meteoric rise and dramatic fall as investors’ choice picks?\nThe Covid-19 pandemic and the availability of funds due to low interest rates had a part to play, according to industry players and experts.\nAssistant professor in finance from the National University of Singapore (NUS) Ben Charoenwong said: “The easy money gave people more liquidity to take risks, driving up returns, which then drove even more interest.” \nWith most parts of the world under Covid-19 lockdowns around 2021, it gave people “more time” to trade NFTs while “initial speculators and high returns attracted others to it”, he added.\nAssociate Professor Deng Xin from NTU's Nanyang Business School said: “Besides the speculative nature, the overwhelming number of new projects and tokens made the NFT market oversaturated, which diluted the uniqueness and value of individual NFTs.”\nThe collapse of some cryptocurrency exchanges, along with the value of main cryptocurrencies around 2021 and 2022, also had spillover impacts on NFTs, said industry players.\nThis is due to the fact that NFTs are transacted using cryptocurrencies, and the crypto-winter also resulted in an overall bearish sentiment hanging over investors’ heads.\nUS billionaire Bill Gates in June 2022 dismissed NFTs (along with cryptocurrencies) as “100 per cent based on Greater Fool theory”, which refers to the idea that an asset’s price is not driven by fundamental values but by the anticipation that another “greater fool” would be willing to buy it from the current owner at a higher price.\n“This is the characteristic of asset bubble logic, and when greater fools run out and there are no new market participants capable of entering and taking on the assets at high prices, then the bubble bursts,” said Asst Prof Charoenwong of NUS.\nHe said that while such a phenomenon exists “in many different assets”, they are typically found in markets for new technologies or products, and when uninformed traders are able to enter the market.\n“It may be because there's no clear benchmark or framework with which to view the product. But in the meantime, as they are learning, the excitement of innovation also seems alluring. In this sense, there are many ‘greater fools’ who can pile into the new technology,” he added. \nThe industry players acknowledged there have been some bad actors during the heyday of NFT trading including scammers. Dubbed a “rug pull”, such bad acting developers would promote a project such as a new coin or NFT release and then disappear with investors’ money.\nMr Foo believes strongly in empowering people who are new to NFTs or Web 3.0 in general to prevent them from being victim to such malicious activities. To this end, he is currently developing a tool called Wush, which would as “a comprehensive search engine, directory, and aggregator” that can help individuals navigate this relatively new digital domain. \nPast price performance notwithstanding, industry observers and players are cautiously optimistic about NFTs’ prospects as investments. \nMs Bhavna of EY-Parthenon says that an increased corporate interest, expanded use cases for NFTs and greater regulatory clarity might drive future growth in the demand for NFTs.\n“Regulators, like those in Hong Kong and the European Union, are beginning to create and refine frameworks to address concerns surrounding digital assets, such as intellectual property rights, consumer protection, and fraud protection. This provides clarity and fosters trust for both consumers and businesses,” she said.\nThen-Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam, in a parliamentary reply in February 2022, said that the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) does not currently regulate NFTs given the nature of their underlying assets, typically tokenising digital art and other collectibles.\nHowever, the authority “looks through” the underlying characteristics of the token to determine if it is to be regulated.\n“Should an NFT have the characteristics of a capital markets product under the Securities and Futures Act, it will be subject to MAS’ regulatory requirements.”\nHe reiterated MAS’ oft-repeated caution that investment in digital tokens, including NFTs, are not suitable for retail investors.\n“For NFTs in particular, their perceived uniqueness, combined with speculative demand, has served to inflate prices. This potentially puts investors at risk of outsized losses should speculative fervour abate.”\nSeparately, MAS previously announced the tightening of a slew of regulations in the cryptocurrency space, to be rolled out gradually from the second half of this year.\nIndustry players said that regulations on the cryptocurrency space may also have a positive spillover impact on NFTs, given that the digital currencies are used to buy these tokens.\nAsst Prof Charoenwong added that cleaning up the cryptocurrency market overall to help get rid of the money laundering activities and providing clear guidelines for the purchase and sale of NFTs using fiat money through “compliant means” will help build a framework that can help make the NFT market “long-term viable”.\nIf there is one thing that all who spoke to TODAY agreed on, it is the applicability of NFTs and its underlying technology beyond investments.\nNFTs have a unique digital signature that exists on a public ledger called a blockchain, which keeps a record of all the transactions relating to the NFT without the risk of tampering.\nThis digital signature means that every NFT is unique, with no two being alike, thus allowing someone to establish ownership of almost anything, from digital art images to videos as well as cars and real estate. \nAnother example of an application is the \"fractionalisation\" of physical art, to make it possible to invest in fine art with limited funds. To do this, an expensive piece of art can be tokenised into many NFTs, with each NFT representing partial ownership of the art piece.\nARC Community, a members-only social club, requires prospective members to buy an NFT that costs 3ETH to gain access to its network of high flyers.\nIts deputy chief executive officer Gabriel Yang said: “For ARC, we have always seen the use of NFTs not as a speculative tool but a genuine, tangible innovation that helps us reimagine the new kind of private membership club we are building. \n“The NFTs also serve as a form of personal identification and a form of social representation in the digital space. Members who hold that NFT are able to showcase their membership publicly and build connections with fellow members as well as with the desired community brand they are associated with (in this case, ARC).”\nMs Tryphena Ellaces Tay, co-founder of non-profit community SG NFT Creators, said her involvement in NFTs had been mainly driven by creative reasons.\n“While I may not have been an active trader, I derived pleasure from immersing myself in the intricacies of (NFT) project white papers and experimenting with their websites,” said Ms Tay.\nA project white paper covers all the key information necessary to plan a project's ecosystem.\n“The allure of the NFT space lies in its promising future, driven by technology that prioritises flexibility and privacy over speculative value. Beyond the recent industry fluctuations, the underlying NFT technology is empowering individuals to securely manage their digital assets and creative works,” added Ms Tay.\nMr Foo of Bored Ape Singapore Club believes that NFTs will find its way into many various aspects of one’s daily life in the future.\n“Because of the blockchain technology behind it… there's just so many use cases for NFTs, let's say, use as your identity document like an IC, or passport, or key card to open your home, or as membership cards,” he said.\nNFTs can provide more secure access to sensitive identity information, providing higher level of security and reducing the need for traditional username and password authentication, for example.\nAsst Prof Charoenwong said that there will always be value for the decentralised nature of NFTs, which allows for “anonymous and unfettered access to the assets and some online communities”.\n“So I think NFTs will have some future. However, I would expect it to be much smaller than we think, and definitely much smaller than what the sentiment was in 2021.” "

            "Article Body": "Adulthood is an invigorating stage of life as young people join the workforce, take on more responsibilities and set their sights on the future. But its many facets — from managing finances and buying a home to achieving work-life balance — can be overwhelming.\nIn this series, TODAY’s journalists help young Singaporeans navigate this stage of their lives and learn something themselves in the process.\nSINGAPORE — As the youngest in the family, I've always been quite comfortable living with my parents and having nothing to worry about in my material needs.\nHowever, as my parents have grown older, they have often spoken to me about having to take over ownership of the home at some point.\nThis responsibility would fall to me because my only other sibling, my older sister, is already married and living in her own home.\nSo, this would essentially mean that I'd need to decide whether to keep living at the family home or sell the place.\nAs someone used to relying on others to make the \"adult decisions\" for me, this has made me uncomfortable.\nFor instance, I'm not keen on the idea of having to engage property agents to assist with selling the family home, if that's the decision I make.\nAnd of course, if I did that, I would then need to buy a place of my own, likely a resale Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat.\nMy discomfort at the idea of dealing with property agents was exacerbated by horror stories I heard from my brother-in-law. He encountered one agent who tried to ask for more than the agreed commission after a sale.\nHe said: \"We had initially agreed to pay the agent a fee of 2 per cent for the sale of our home but he later asked for more commission when we managed to sell the property for a higher price.\" \nI asked if they had initially agreed on the fee and he said that they did but the agent later \"guilt-tripped\" him into thinking that more effort was put in to hunt for buyers. \nAlthough reluctant to give in to the agent, he eventually paid a 4 per cent commission for the condominium that was sold. \nThe conversation made me wary, but it was a doorway into a world I'd never thought much about, so I did some online research about agents and commissions.\nAfter all, I could find myself as both a seller and buyer of residential property some time down the track.\nI learnt that some agents typically take between 2 per cent and 4 per cent commission or, in some cases, a fixed rate of 1 per cent. Then, there are others who take a flat fee as their commission. A flat fee remains the same no matter what the price is for the property sale.\nAnother key point is that it's usually sellers who pay the commission to agents, though buyers do so on occasions, such as when buying resale HDB flats.\nSome fixed-rate agents have been using social media channels such as TikTok to promote themselves by questioning the need for homeowners to pay the typically higher commission rates.\nThese agents often tout the five-figure savings that their clients enjoy, even including testimonies with smiling photographs from some of them.\nIn turn, agents who go by commission-based fees have responded with their own social media posts claiming that flat-fee agents do not offer as complete a service as them.\nSeeking clarification, I decided to reach out to property experts and academics to find out more about what a young potential homeowner like me should look out for when engaging my first property agent.\nBuyers should expect to pay a 1 per cent commission if they are buying an HDB resale flat.\nHowever, buyers generally don't pay a commission purchasing private properties such as condominiums and landed properties, because the buyer's agent will usually \"co-broke\" with the seller's agent to share the commission received. \nProfessor Qian Wenlan, director of the Institute of the Real Estate and Urban Studies at the National University of Singapore (NUS), said that property agents who accept a flat fee are \"still a minority\".\nMost agents charge sellers the standard rate of 2 per cent of the purchase price of the property, she added.\nOne agency, Homeseller, which started out in 2019, charges a flat fee of S$1,999 to sellers of HDB resale flats and S$4,999 to sellers of condominiums.\nIt also charges a flat fee of S$1,999 to buyers of HDB resale flats.\nSo a buyer who appoints Homeseller to search for a HDB resale flat and buys it for S$790,000 will pay S$1,999 instead of S$7,900 that a commission-based agent charges.\nA seller of a S$790,000 HDB flat who also pays S$1,999 will save more, given that the commission for agents is 2 per cent or S$15,800.\nNew property agency Smartseller charges S$3,700 for sellers of HDB resale flats, S$7,700 for sellers of condominiums, and S$15,700 for sellers of landed properties.\nIn this case, if a seller were to appoint Smartseller to sell his S$1.35 million condominium, the co-brokered commission would be the flat fee of S$7,700 instead of between S$27,000 and S$54,000, which is the 2 per cent to 4 per cent that a commission-based agent charges.\nProf Qian said that the main distinguishing feature of flat-rate agents is that they tend to offer only partial services, whereas agents who charge the standard fee provide the full suite of services.\nReferring to flat-fee agents, she said: \"They are responsible for just the advertising, arranging viewing appointments and supporting with paperwork.\"\nAlthough they arrange the viewing appointments, they leave the seller to conduct the viewing.\nMr Dennis Lim, co-founder of property firm Homeseller who operates on a flat-fee basis, said that as an experienced property agent, he finds it \"boring\" to be around viewings because he does not add any value.\n\"I feel more accomplished when I focus on the prior consultation and the negotiation.\" \nMr Wilfred John Allais, marketing lead at Ohmyhome property agency, said that his firm charges 1 per cent commission for buyers and sellers of HDB resale flats.\nThe firm's agents will meet with buyers to discuss their housing preferences and understand their financial plans to ensure that they look at properties within their budget.\n\"Buyers can engage our agents to help find their dream HDB (resale) home at a fee of 1 per cent,\" he added.\n\"For condos, our agents will not charge the buyer but instead collaborate with the seller's agent through a co-broking arrangement.\" \nOn the other hand, agents such as Mr Geryl Lim from property firm OrangeTee take a percentage of the commission from sellers based on the transacted price for the sale or purchase.\nHe also said that first-time buyers would need to consider the customised scope of services that they are expecting from the agent before going ahead with a particular agent.\n\"As far as I am aware, most flat-fee agents do not turn up for appointments but leave the buyers to handle the viewings themselves, so these agents may not have any idea how the unit looks like or if there are any potential issues with the unit,\" Mr Geryl Lim said.  \nWithout an agent present, it can be difficult to show off the amenities of the property, which could make a huge difference in deciding if the unit is worth the price listed.\nProfessor Sing Tien Foo, provost's chair at the department of real estate at NUS Business School, said that it is important to find and engage property agents who are reliable and have good track records.\nHe said that this is especially important for young people and first-time homeowners like me.\n\"These agents will be able to provide objective and also unbiased advice based on the client's needs and financial considerations, and will be able to act in the best of the their interest rather than be merely motivated by their commissions or fees,\" he added.\nIn addition to checking reviews and making time for research to see what types of property the agent has sold, property experts also told me that it is key to ensure that the agent is registered with the Council for Estate Agencies, to avoid being cheated by a scam.\nPerhaps the advice that stuck with me the most came from Mr Luqman Hakim, chief data officer at property outfit 99.co, who said that the best thing for first-time homeowners is to find property agents not according to their fees but based on their level of experience in closing the sale of a property.\n\"Deeply discounted flat-fee agents or agencies are susceptible to lapses in giving proper service,\" he warned.\n\"The atypical low price advertised does not justify the returns of the typical amount of work and care provided by agents to market and close the property properly.\"\nAfter speaking with the experts and academics, I realised that preparing to engage a property agent for the first time requires a lot of thought.\nWhile I now have a better idea of what I am looking for in a property agent, the discussion has led me to realise that I may not be ready just yet to take over ownership of our family home.\nStill, I know it will happen eventually and I am hoping that when the time comes to make the difficult decision to sell my family home, I'll be well-equipped to engage the right property agent to assist me.

But its many facets — from managing finances and buying a home to achieving work-life balance — can be overwhelming.\nIn this series, TODAY’s journalists help young Singaporeans navigate this stage of their lives and learn something themselves in the process.\nSINGAPORE — Recently, while I was in the middle of my seven months' long internship, I recall lying on my exercise mat fully dressed in my physical training attire, as though I was ready to commence my workout.\nBut unless my exercise routine consisted solely of the corpse pose, I did absolutely nothing that night.\nIt was close to midnight, and I had just knocked off from work, having pushed through multiple assignments that day. I realised that I only had enough willpower to change into my exercise kit but lacked the headspace to start the exercise.\n“Maybe tomorrow,” I thought to myself and resigned myself to the fact that it was going to be another day of physical inactivity.\nThis was becoming a common occurrence months after starting my first \"full-time job\" seven months ago, when I started my internship with TODAY as a journalist. These were my first steps as a newcomer in the workforce.\nIn the weeks before my internship began, I had resolved to start my journey towards healthier living. That meant incorporating daily exercises such as running and weight training, paired with close monitoring of my daily calorie intake.\nBut as soon as my first few work deadlines landed and in my daily haste to do a good job, any exercise routine I had went by the wayside. Once, I even found myself inadvertently skipping my meals.\nMy calorie-counting habits also gradually turned into subconscious snacking as I scavenged kitchen cupboards and raided pantries, eating whatever was conveniently available throughout the day.\nAlthough I was able to slowly acclimate to the workload, periods of increased stress caused my weight to fluctuate heavily from my all-time lowest of 78kg to around 84kg.\nDon't get me wrong, I know that these could be construed as excuses that can be overcome with enough determination and motivation.\nBut now that my internship is about to come to an end and I'll soon be entering the workforce upon graduation, I wanted to find out how I am able to cultivate the right mindset and deal with work stress concurrently. How can I manage my fitness goals while being a functional adult?\nTo find out, I spoke to several psychologists and dietitians who gave me some insights on why young adults going through a study-to-work transition may face additional stress, and how they can better manage their fitness and time during such adjustment periods. \nRight off the bat, Dr Annabelle Chow, a clinical psychologist in private practice at Annabelle Psychology in Singapore, helped me identify the common stressors for young adults going through adjustment periods.\nThis included increased responsibilities and meeting deadlines, as well as less common factors such as unclear workplace processes and organisational changes. \n“The shift in schedule and demands on our brains and bodies can disrupt sleep patterns, and make it challenging to maintain a healthy exercise routine or eat nutritious meals. The sedentary nature of many office jobs can also take a toll on physical health if we're not intentional about staying active,\n“The pressure to perform well and prove ourselves in a new environment can be quite overwhelming. Additionally, the learning curve and expectations may be higher, leading to increased feelings of stress and possibly imposter syndrome,” she said.\nRecalling my sleepless nights, anxiously worrying about any potential mistakes in my work, I found it hard to disagree with her assessment.\nMr Dion Lo Zhen Yu, a senior clinical psychologist and deputy head of therapy services at Better Life Psychological Medicine Clinic, added that young adults may feel a loss of autonomy and control during adjustment periods.\nDuring such phases, encountering obstacles may “evoke a sense of worthlessness, helplessness or even hopelessness”.\n“So (they) turn to something that’s accessible, that (they) think will give them a sense of power and control,” he said. \nWhile this may manifest in potentially healthy habits such as adopting a fitness regime for some, many turn to more convenient outlets which provide immediate gratification such as binge eating, which provides a false sense of control without tackling the underlying causes of stress.\nHaving gone through chapters of constant calorie consumption during stressful periods, I knew the highs and lows all too well.\nMs Shalyn Yamanaka, an accredited dietitian with the Singapore Nutrition and Dietetics Association, explained that eating comfort foods triggers the release of dopamine, a feel-good neurotransmitter that provides temporary relief from stress or unhappiness.\n“These behaviours can become habitual due to their ease, accessibility and the conditioning to associate them with immediate stress relief,” she said. \nAdopting an active and healthy lifestyle as a working adult not only brings about physical benefits but can also promote emotional well-being and improve cognitive function, said Dr Chow. \n“Exercise releases endorphins, which are natural mood boosters. These endorphins help reduce stress, increase feelings of happiness and well-being, and improve sleep quality, resulting in a more relaxed and rejuvenated state of mind,\n“Cognitively, exercise enhances blood flow to the brain, promoting brain function and improving focus, making it easier to cope with stressors. Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight, combined with regular exercise, can foster a sense of accomplishment,” she added. \nAs I slogged through my adjustment period and gradually increased my efficiency at work, I began adopting a more structured fitness routine, but still found myself dissatisfied with my seemingly slow rate of progression. \nI simply wasn’t seeing the fast results in weight loss and fitness improvement I desperately craved.\nTo this, Mr Lo explained that those just starting their fitness journeys may jump the gun and overcompensate, setting unrealistic goals for themselves, potentially from a guilt or fear-driven mindset that is often unsustainable. \nInstead, Mr Lo recommended a “staircase” approach to goal setting, taking incremental steps and setting realistic milestones while recognising “micro-successes” along the way.\nDr Chow raised similar points, suggesting breaking down goals into manageable, five to ten-minute routines that can easily fit into daily schedules. \n“Celebrate taking a step forward, even if it seems small. A step forward is in itself worthy of celebration, compared to never taking a step at all,\n“We tend to overestimate our goals and underestimate our achievements. Do the opposite. Craft specific, clear, measurable steps and checkpoints that we celebrate each time we hit them. From time to time, re-evaluate your goals and how important they are to you,” she said.\nMs Yamanaka added that our health and fitness goals should evolve, but be rooted in intrinsically enjoyable activities.\n“Figure out what makes you happy and content. Find a running or cycling group, tennis partner, or yoga class that you enjoy. Find a friend that will go with you, so it is a social activity and you have someone who keeps you accountable.\n“When you are doing something for the love of it, and really enjoy it, the habit is more sustainable and is no longer a chore to do,” she said.\nAs for cultivating healthy eating habits, experts shared that moderation and diversification of stress outlets were key factors in managing our consumption habits. \n“There is no harm in eating the food we like or buying a gift for ourselves once in a while. However, if it becomes our default way of coping with stress, that is when we need to supplement our stress management toolbox,” said Dr Chow.\n“If you enjoy a piece of cake as an afternoon snack, sit and savour that cake and check in with how you are feeling at dinner to see if you need to eat a full meal or not,” added Ms Yamanaka.\nMost importantly, my main takeaway after speaking to the experts was to have realistic expectations for ourselves during our fitness journeys. \nSomehow, it had not occurred to me that setting a half marathon distance of 21.1km as my next milestone, after only managing 14km on my longest run thus far, was clearly unrealistic. \nTreating each run as a wasted effort just because I had not surpassed my previous pace or distance certainly did not help.\nAs I will soon be starting another job during the holidays before returning to school for my final term, I plan to incorporate a sustainable fitness routine with attainable goals into my weekly schedule.\nBut before that, armed with all these adulting tips, I’ll need to rediscover my passion for fitness. \nMaybe it’s time to lace up my shoes and go for my first relaxing run in a while.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nTan Ming Chuan is an intern journalist and producer at TODAY."

            "Article Body": "Adulthood is an invigorating stage of life as young people join the workforce, take on more responsibilities and set their sights on the future. But its many facets — from managing finances and buying a home to achieving work-life balance — can be overwhelming.\nIn this series, TODAY’s journalists help young Singaporeans navigate this stage of their lives and learn something themselves in the process.\nSINGAPORE — As a bright-eyed fresh graduate, I was thrilled to land my first full-time job last year and was raring to tear off the “unemployed” tag that comes in the period after completing one's studies.\nFinally, I would be financially independent, or so I thought, but things do not always turn out the way you hope.\nAfter just three months, I was laid off from my role as part of a wider retrenchment exercise and was once again unemployed. Most of the staff in my small team lost their jobs.\nTo add salt to the wound, the letter bearing the grim news was handed to me exactly a week after I had received my employment confirmation letter.\nNaturally, I was bummed about the turn of events, but I resolved to secure a new gig as soon as possible.\nAnd so, I jumped back into the job search cycle again — sending out resumes and going for job interviews until I  landed a job at TODAY early this year.\nBut even as I settled into my new role, I could not shake the anxiety that I might lose my \"rice bowl\" once again.\nThere were moments that caused my thoughts to spiral toward the worst possible outcome of getting let go by the company and led me to recall my experience with retrenchment.\nFor instance, a message from my editor simply to ask how I was coping and to have a chat about my goal-setting gave me a mini panic attack — my palms turned clammy and I began to ruminate on how I had been performing.\nWould this lead to a chat about getting let go instead?\nInitially, I attributed my nerves to new job jitters — who doesn't feel slightly on edge when thrust into a new environment?\nBut when such feelings persisted past my first month at work, I confided in some friends about my fears and learnt that I was not alone in experiencing such feelings.\nIn fact, a recent survey by TODAY found that 74 per cent of youths think that they could be retrenched at least once in their lifetime.\nThe experience of losing my job so abruptly made me question if I had what it took to tackle the tasks that were handed to me.\nEven though I had been retrenched for some time, I did not like talking about it as I had associated it with having not performed up to standard.\nIn fact, the thought that haunted me the most each time I recalled my retrenchment was that it seemed a lot like a line from a bad break-up: Was I not good enough?\nWhen I spoke to Dr Geraldine Tan, the principal psychologist at The Therapy Room, about my experience, she said that those who have been laid off should understand that getting retrenched is not a personal thing.\n“Because your self-esteem has taken a beating from this rejection, many of us will experience doubt and question our abilities to perform up to task.” \nDr Tan added that the lack of transparency on the part of companies about the retrenchment criteria also fuels the self-doubt that those who have been laid off face, causing many to question why they were “chosen” to be let go over others.\nThe timing of my retrenchment — just a week after my confirmation — and the shock of it compounded my self-doubt and caused my anxiety to persist long after I had settled into a new job.\nCareer coach Adrian Choo, chief executive of consulting firm Career Agility International, said that retrenchments are commonplace today with no negative associations.\n“Whether you’re a fresh graduate or in middle management, a lot of individuals have this issue of feeling anxious about their work performance today.” \nHe added that hiring managers are also more understanding of the job market situation now.\nRetrenched workers need a change in mindset over being laid off, Dr Tan said.\nThey should see the event not as reflecting a personal flaw but rather a corporate decision to sustain the company.\nAs I got used to the fast pace of the newsroom, I temporarily forgot my anxieties as the day-to-day work would take up most of my attention.\nEven so, there were times when I would make a mistake and start to question my ability to do my job well.\nTo allay such anxieties, Mr Choo suggested that workers check in regularly with their supervisors to understand how they were performing and where they could improve.\n\"This can reduce work-related anxiety and allow open communication between bosses and workers,\" he said. \nAnd while many would have heard this advice before, Mr Choo reiterated that learning new skills is the top way to ensure one’s relevance in the job market, regardless if you’re new to the job or a seasoned professional.\nAnd whether or not you’re facing an impending retrenchment, Mr Choo stressed the importance of networking to grow your circle of contacts.\nYou can turn to these contacts to seek out other job opportunities in the unfortunate case of a layoff, he said.\nLuckily for me, I kept in contact with my previous internship employer, who kindly provided me with freelance writing gigs while I continued to search for a full-time position.\nMy current role also allows me to interact with people of different backgrounds, giving me many opportunities to meet and network with others outside of the industry.\nIn the months after I was laid off, I also took up a copy writing course on the open online course provider platform Coursera.\nMy previous role, while it also involving writing, was rather content-heavy and seldom touched on more technical aspects such as content marketing. \nI won’t deny it — the learning curve in the course was steep at first as I was unfamiliar with the technical jargon.\nHowever, I figured that knowing how to market my work would help greatly to distinguish myself from the pool of talent in the job market.\nOn the emotional wellness side of things, Dr Tan suggested simple exercises such as going on a brisk walk to get some sun and clear your head or shaking your hands out to release any pent-up tension when you get too overwhelmed.\nShe said having a support network will also make things easier to manage as it can help you to discuss any lingering anxieties and ease you into your new role.\nWhile trying to get used to my new role, I confided in my family and friends about some of my fears.\nThey offered insights and advice based on their own experience, helping me to rationalise my anxieties as well as think about my long-term career goals.\nBut most importantly, workers should concentrate on what they are good at and reinforce it so that they will be able to showcase their skills, Dr Tan and Mr Choo both said.\n“Remind yourself of what you are good at, rather than what you are not good at, so that you can help yourself to better manage your anxieties and doubts,” Dr Tan said.\nAs part of the goals I set for myself this year, learning how to create and edit videos was one of the top items on my agenda. \nThis month, I will get the opportunity to try out a month-long attachment as a producer with the Audience Growth team at TODAY, where I will be learning how to edit videos and try my hand at story boarding, among other things.\nDespite knowing full well that I am a complete noob at anything related to creating videos, I am more excited than ever to take on this new role. \nPicking up new skills may not be the easiest, but these fresh skills will help in my job search should I eventually move on to my next gig.\nWho knows, I might create a video that's good enough for an award nomination some time.\nI suppose the process of losing a job is a lot like breaking up with a partner you've become attached to.\nIn both scenarios we feel a sense of loss, then indignation and finally learning to come to terms with it — almost like a grieving process where healing comes only after you acknowledge the pain. \nFor now, I'll start off by checking in with my editor to find out how I'm performing at work.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nShynn Ong is a journalist at TODAY covering general news."

But its many facets — from managing finances and buying a home to achieving work-life balance — can be overwhelming.\nIn this series, TODAY’s journalists help young Singaporeans navigate this stage of their lives and learn something themselves in the process.\nSINGAPORE —  Whenever I think about the year 2021, tears well up and I feel this lump in my throat as grief overwhelms me with the memory of that fateful day when my pet dog left my life permanently.\nMy dog was a lively and mischievous white Maltese who became a part of the family as soon as we laid eyes on him.\nHe was considered the runt of the litter, a tad smaller than his siblings, but we were won over by his human-like personality which made him stand out.\nWhile I'm comfortable writing this column about the loss of my dog, I can't bring myself to publish his name as this would be too painful.\nHaving my dog with me for half my life, since about the age of 15, I had always been aware that eventually I would lose him.\nThis only increased when he had health issues requiring regular rounds of treatment.\nOur family eventually lost him on a gloomy September morning in 2021 when he was 15 years old. \nWhen we woke up to find that he had passed, I remember feeling like my whole world had been completely shattered.\nIt's the only time I have felt truly heartbroken as waves of anguish washed over me. I remember going through a series of emotions, and the one that stuck with me was the feeling of regret. \nA week after his cremation, I quit my job and fell into this routine of having full-on meltdowns every day. I lost interest in doing things that I used to love and avoided going to places which reminded me of my dog.\nI am the youngest of my family, with one older sister, and after joining the family, my dog had been my closest companion.\nDuring my secondary school days, he accompanied me while I studied and waited for the rest of the family to come home from work. When I was sad, he'd be the one sitting next to me, offering comfort. \nFor all these reasons and more, his death was especially hard for me to process because I felt like I failed him by not being there for him when he took his last breath. I regretted having spent all my time doing other things when I could have used that time wisely with my dog.\nIt did not help that the sudden jarring emptiness at home only made it more evident that he was no longer around.\nAs my family watched me struggle with my grief, I was grateful to have them rally around to support me in whatever way they could.\nFrom offering a listening ear to talking with me about the happy memories of my dog, they did their best to listen and understand to help me cope with the overwhelming emotions.\nLooking back on 2021, I am surprised that the death of my pet had affected me as much as it did.\nDespite the understanding from my family, I still feel slightly embarrassed whenever a relative makes a comment about how dramatic I had been over the death of \"just a pet\".\nWondering whether this was abnormal, I spoke to grief experts to find out how the emotional impact of losing a pet compares with losing a human, and if my grief will ever go away.\n\"The grief for a pet would not be less and for some people it would mean even more grief as the love and care invested is more than that of a human,\" said Dr Geraldine Tan, director and principal psychologist of the Therapy Room.\nShe added: \"A pet's love is unconditional and therefore irreplaceable.\"\nDr Sylvia Tan, founder and principal counselling psychologist at Sylvia Tan Psychology Consultancy echoed this sentiment.\nShe said some studies have found that grief over a pet can last longer than grief for a human, and those who grieve over a pet's death are three times more likely to develop symptoms of depression than the average person.\nShe also pointed out that in cases like mine, where the pet is seen as a source of comfort and companionship, the death would be much more significant and impactful because of the deep connection shared.\nThe experts said one misguided belief about grief they often hear is how it has a fixed timeline or an \"expiration date\".\nThey said that it is common to think this way because of a general misconception that if someone is still feeling sad after some time has passed since the death, the person is somehow not moving on.\nTo this, Ms Alexandra Bohnen, senior counsellor at Sofia Wellness Clinic said: \"Grief is not linear, and while the intensity usually lessens over time, it behaves more like waves that hit us.\"\nI felt a sense of relief hearing that what I had been through was a normal reaction to the loss of an important companion in my life.\nIt feels rather validating as well, knowing that even if I cry when I miss my dog, it does not mean I'm being overtly sensitive.\nWhen I asked if this grief I feel will ever go away, Ms Bohnen advised that it will get easier as the waves of emotion become less frequent and less intense as life moves on but I would learn to live and grow without my dog with me.\nI take that advice with me now whenever I feel those tears well up.\nIt's been more than 18 months now and while my emotions have settled for the most part, I still have days when I burst out crying from seeing an owner interact with their dog or come across a TikTok video talking about topics such as \"Five ways to know your dog loves you\".\nIn a way, my grief has taught me a lot about myself and while I know that I will always miss him dearly, it will eventually get easier with time.\nABOUT THE WRITER:\nJasmine Ong, 32, is a journalist at TODAY."

But its many facets — from managing finances and buying a home to achieving work-life balance — can be overwhelming.\nIn this series, TODAY’s journalists help young Singaporeans navigate this stage of their lives and learn something themselves in the process.\nSINGAPORE — In the last two years, five people I knew died from sudden cardiac arrest. They were young and seemingly healthy people whose untimely demise came as a shock to their family and friends.\nThey ranged in age from about 25 to 35.\nThe grief hit me pretty hard, as I felt a lot of guilt and regret about my relationship with some of them. It got me to thinking — are more young people dying from sudden cardiac arrest? And should I be worried?\nCardiologists from the National University Heart Centre Singapore told me that the risk of sudden deaths in young people remains exceedingly low.\nBased on the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) data report published by the Singapore Heart Foundation four years ago, those above the age of 65 constitute the highest risk group of patients, accounting for 36.2 per cent of the 3,000 cases of cardiac arrest in 2019. There are about 3,000 cases of OHCA yearly here.\nOne cardiologist told me that the prevalence of OHCA in Indians and Malays is twice the rate of Chinese. The prevalence of OHCA in men is also twice that of women. \nWhile uncommon, there are underlying conditions among young adults that can lead to sudden deaths, such as hypertrophic cardiomypathy (abnormal thickening of heart muscles) or arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythm of genetic causes), another cardiologist said. \nThis is why health screenings are important, as people often believe themselves to be healthy if they do not have any symptoms of underlying disease when they may have conditions that are asymptomatic.\nThough sudden cardiac arrest among young people with no underlying conditions is rare, I could not shake this feeling that my life could be taken from me at any time.\nThis led me to move beyond concerns over cardiac arrest affecting the young to wonder more broadly at the meaning of my brief, mortal existence. I was left feeling unmotivated and uneasy. \nDon’t get me wrong, my life is going okay — I have a good job, I have a roof over my head, I have two beautiful kids and a supportive husband — but I was being consumed by this thought that if life is so short, why bother doing anything?\nIt occurred to me that I was perhaps having an existential crisis.\nDr Praveen Nair, a psychologist and senior consultant at Raven Counselling and Consultancy, said that this occurs when there is an inner conflict within an individual causing them to break from traditional thinking patterns and recalibrate to become more contemplative with regard to questions about meaning, purpose and identity in life. \nDr Nair also reassured me that I am not the only one feeling this way, as he has seen more adult clients with similar issues. \nOne contributor to this is social media, said Dr Nair, as some netizens cherry pick what they share online to present a rosy picture of their lives, which can cause other users viewing the content to experience \"fomo\" (fear of missing out).\nThis, in turn, can lead them to wondering about their direction in life. \nDr Nair said it is normal to experience an existential crisis even when things in your life seem to be going okay as many things, both overt and subliminal, can influence our thoughts even when our lives are relatively routine.\nIn fact, some argue that the mundane and routine can be a stimulus to initiating thoughts about the larger meaning or purpose of life. \nThis makes sense, as I have been feeling a certain kind of tedium for some time now, juggling work and caring for two young children daily. \nMs Abigail Yang, a grief therapist at counselling platform Talk Your Heart Out, said that it is normal to think deeply about life or question how you feel about it.\nThe more fundamental issue is when no answer satisfies you, she added. \n“It becomes a constant loop of complex questions with no fulfilling solution. This, in turn, leads to a conflict within yourself about your reason for existence,” said Ms Yang.\nIn some cases, extreme thoughts and unanswerable questions can leave one feeling frustrated, anxious, depressed and even suicidal, said experts. \nThey also shared that one way to overcome an existential crisis is to disengage from pursuits or people that bring me no joy and redirect my energy to those that do. Dr Nair said this can help initiate renewed drive and motivation in life. \n“It may sound counterintuitive but many great innovations occurred when inventors experienced an existential crisis. They channelled their energies into a new venture that was motivating,” he told me. \nOne way to overcome the crisis is to also take time to connect more with people whose company I enjoy, as an existential crisis can occur when we feel disconnected from others, said Dr Nair. \nMs Yang reminded me that it is okay to allow myself to feel such negative emotions, and that I should not suppress them. \nSome people block out pain and suffering, thinking this will make them happy, but it can often lead to a false sense of happiness, she said.\nEmbodying emotions and acknowledging feelings of pain, discontentment and dissatisfaction can open the door to personal growth, and improve one’s outlook on life, Ms Yang added.\nOne tip I got from a friend that has helped me deal with my existential crisis is this: \"KonMari\" your schedule, rid yourself of self-imposed duties and obligations and identify areas where you could be doing less, doing something easier, or doing nothing at all.\nThis is a reference to Japanese author Marie Kondo and her ideas about ridding our lives of needless clutter.\nThis might mean, for instance, your one-hour exercise routine becomes a 20-minute one, or perhaps you ditch it all together for an extra hour of sleep. \nThe only person that should be happy with the choice you make is you. \nABOUT THE WRITER:\nNabilah Awang, 29, is a former Senior Journalist at TODAY."

But its many facets — from managing finances and buying a home to achieving work-life balance — can be overwhelming.\nIn this series, TODAY’s journalists help young Singaporeans navigate this stage of their lives and learn something themselves in the process.\nSINGAPORE – As a Singapore Polytechnic student, I knew it would only be a matter of time till I had to do an internship, since it was part of the criteria for finishing my course in creative writing. But the inevitability of it didn’t make the idea any less scary to me. \nPrior to interning, the only jobs I ever worked were part-time jobs that lasted only for the duration of my holidays, a vastly different experience from a six-month-long internship in a newsroom.\nHaving to hold down a graded \"grown up\" job for six months absolutely terrified me. It felt like 22 weeks worth of opportunities to mess up.\nAnd after two rough semesters academically, I was terrified of fumbling it all up.\nSo when I finally landed an internship in the TODAY newsroom, the pressure to not mess up was immense, especially because getting fired from the internship guaranteed an instant fail for an entire semester’s worth of credits.\nYet as I wrap up the final weeks of my internship, I’m walking away with a positive outlook on my time here, having learned so many things about myself and about the professional working world. \nWeeks before my internship even started, I was already dreading the thought of it. I felt such immense anxiety about messing up at work that I wanted to avoid it all together. \nBut no matter what, the need to graduate trumped all my anxieties. Pushing my worries to the back of my mind, I pulled myself together and showed up for my first day.\nOn my first week of work, I felt like I was thrown into the deep end.\nAfter being sent to a press conference (with another reporter to shadow) on my second day and having to contact owners of big businesses on my third day of work, I quickly learned that the actual job is very different from what I learned in school.\nI relied heavily on guidance and advice from other reporters I shadowed, which was apparently the right thing to do, said Mr Ben So, founder and career coach of Emunah Coaching and Training.\nHe said that when starting a new job, it is important to know the company's structure and culture.\n“Be humble to ask your colleagues or supervisor how things are done in this company and do your best to follow,” Mr So said.\nBut as time passed, I feared the “window of time” where it's acceptable to make mistakes was closing, and I was still messing up too often.\nI had this expectation of how I should have been performing that created an extra layer of stress at work. But that shouldn't have been the case.\nMr So said that although an internship is an opportunity for employers to see if a candidate is a good fit for a full-time position, it is also a chance for the intern to experience this new environment.\n“The intern should observe the work culture and ask themselves if they truly enjoy the job scope and working with the team,” he said.\nI was focusing too much on the wrong thing, which was my own expectations, rather than the actual experience I was having. \nAnd I had to learn that messing up is an inevitability when you’re new to anything.\nMr Ng Jun Sen, one of the editors who supervise interns at TODAY, said that although it's good to have interns who are able to handle their workload well, “the ones who leave a lasting impression are those who start out with uncertainties and make mistakes… but always kept their chin up, put in the hard work and improved over the course of their internship”.\n“I expect interns to challenge themselves and strive to discover their potential. Excelling is optional, but seeing interns put in effort means everything,” he added.\nThis expectation of my work that I’d set for myself set me on the path of burning out, which hit me halfway through my stint.\nPerhaps it was also because I was not used to working for such a long period or that I was simply running out of steam. I woke up feeling tired every day regardless of how much rest I got and I felt disillusioned with what I was doing.\nWhen it comes to struggling at work, Mr So advised that interns speak to their supervisors, mentor or senior colleagues for assistance, or if they feel uncomfortable talking to someone at work about it, a career coach could also help.\nThe advice was echoed by Mr Ng who added that when facing issues, the first thing anyone should do is to understand where the issue lies, look at how others at work deal with the problem and strategise from there.\n“The best part of being an intern is that you're young, you're given many chances by default, and trying and failing is part of your growth,” he said.\nWhile I slowly got a grip of what I was doing at work, I was faced with another issue that I was unprepared for, having to do the adult thing and having a “work-life balance”.\nMr So suggested that interns or people new to working life meet up with their peers to update one another of their work adventures, spend their weekends with family, and do sports to help maintain work-life balance.\nI struggled to do any of these.\nI was unable to see my friends as often as I did when we were in school. Since most of my friends were interning as well, it was hard to find time to see each other together, even if it was just for a quick meal. \nPlanning gatherings felt like solving an equation with so many factors to account for and different schedules to accommodate.\nNot only that, I had to learn to make time for myself to just unwind and relax, be it after work or on weekends, because I found myself obsessively thinking about work even in my free time.\nTime felt like it was flying by, with all my days mushing together into one. I had only a few hours to myself after work and I wasn’t used to having so little time to myself.\nSo in an attempt to not become one of those folks whose life revolved around their jobs, I began exploring more activities to do in my own time.\nI began creating a \"schedule\" for my free time, allocating time every evening for playing my guitar, gaming or just chatting with my friends over Discord. I made sure to carve out time to relax and socialise with friends. \nOn weekends, I allocated one day to do activities and hang out with friends, and one day to shut off my brain and be lazy at home. I even picked up bouldering as a new hobby to do with friends every week or so.\nThough interning has been a rollercoaster, it has taught me so much about the job that I’ve wanted to do since I was 15, given me a taste of adult working life and allowed me to learn more about how to handle my personal wellbeing. \nAnd who knows, maybe someday after I finish my studies, I might want to join the industry full time.\n \nABOUT THE WRITER:\nLou Si Yuan, 19, is an intern journalist at TODAY."

Neither can it be too practical, and having an element of surprise is a plus point.\nOne colleague told me: “If someone asked I would tell them I don’t want anything. Though I really want a nice bottle of gin.”\nWhile Mariah Carey’s All I Want for Christmas is You may be blasting through the speakers, I wish my presence is enough as a gift so that I can stop swiping my card and stop walking down the same malls over and over again.\nSo why is it so difficult to find the perfect present? And how can we make the festive season more festive? I spoke to experts to unwrap the struggles of gift-giving.\nSingapore University of Social Sciences Associate Professor Jimmy Wong describes gift-giving as a “very complex social phenomenon” with multiple factors — such as the relationship between the giver and receiver, their desires and the context of gift-giving.\n“Receiving the right gift will bring delight and pleasure. This is obvious and is in our consciousness,” said Assoc Prof Wong.\n“But what lurks in the subconscious resides mainly with the giver. Little do we realise that giving the ‘perfect’ gift showcases the giver’s worth and self-esteem. It also shows the giver's taste and reflects one’s social standing.”\nAssoc Prof Wong said that when choosing a gift for someone close, like a family member or romantic partner, we are more involved in the process of selecting a gift — hence, the added stress. \nBut when it comes to acquaintances, we are less involved and would then be less stressed. \nAnd there’s added difficulty when we don’t know the receiver well enough, said Dr Carmen Teo, the founder of Mindful Insights, a company that does mindfulness and compassion training to individuals and organisations.\nThere is also the question of how to make sure our money is well spent on the gift, or how our efforts can be well used.\n“Psychologically, it can also feel hard (to decide on a gift) when self-doubts kick in and we wonder whether the receiver would appreciate all that we have given,” said Dr Teo.\nI could not help but agree. Christmas shopping for my family often includes going around shops multiple times to look around in case I stumble upon a better gift.\nWhen searching for a gift, experts say there are two things to consider — who the receiver is, and what context you are giving the gift to.\nExperts also warn that it is important to avoid gifting something that may cause embarrassment.\nOne example Assoc Prof Wong shared was if a student gifted a professor an expensive gift, which may put the professor in an “uncomfortable situation”.\nSo what about a handmade gift? Assoc Prof Wong said that this depends on how close you are to the receiver — the closer you are, the more likely the gift will be appreciated.\nHe cautioned that gifting an elaborate handmade gift may inadvertently cause embarrassment for the receiver who had not put in a similar effort.\nBut an easier way is to openly communicate with each other, said founder of Centre for Mindfulness Dr Kathirasan K. \n“Now with technology, it's easy to have a wish list which people can refer to and purchase something they want,” he said.\n“Personally, my wife and I would rather gift acts of charity as opposed to physical items because it's less wasteful.”\nWhile he noted that the younger generation might find it easier to share their needs and wants — such as through social media — the older generations often see conservatism as a virtue.\nAssoc Prof Wong noted that often in Asian culture, it is “only polite to say no, when deep down, we mean that we really want something”.\nTo overcome that, he suggests seeking inputs from the recipient’s close friend or colleague for hints. Wish lists are also a good way to avoid the stress and embarrassment of buying a bad gift.\nNonetheless, Dr Teo said that gifts should be bought out of sincerity and that the thought behind it is most important.\n“Most people do not need more gifts, they need more love (and compassion). Even when you do give something physical, it serves as the conduit to expressing your love for this person,” she said.\nSo, to my friends, family and acquaintances reading this article, I would appreciate it if you could send me your wish lists, so as to end my agony of hearing jingle bells for the umpteenth time in a shopping mall.\nThough, and I beg you, please bear in mind inflation.\nABOUT THE WRITER:\nLoraine Lee, 24, is a journalist at TODAY, covering environment, housing and education."

But its many facets — from managing finances and buying a home to achieving work-life balance — can be overwhelming.\nIn this series, TODAY’s journalists help young Singaporeans navigate this stage of their lives and learn something themselves in the process.\nSINGAPORE — The Covid-19 pandemic may have brought much chaos and inconvenience to us all, but one silver-lining, for me at least, was that I got to enjoy my mum’s home-cooked meals more frequently since I had to work from home.\nI love my mother’s food. They are not elaborate meals. Sliced fish porridge, bee hoon soup or, if she is feeling fancy, miso butter pasta with tuna and cabbage. Pretty simple, but fairly healthy and cooked with love.\nAnd a good, warm meal goes a long way to putting a smile on my face even on the most trying of days. But since I moved out of my parents’ home not too long ago, it’s been hard to replicate that feeling.\nI’m no stranger to the kitchen, mind you, so I didn’t think that providing home-cooked meals for myself and my partner would be a problem.\nAs it turned out, we would be lucky if I could even find the time to put together a bowl of noodle soup with leafy greens that have gone yellow after weeks of not being used.\nOtherwise, it’s either reaching for the phone to get a food delivery of something, usually unhealthy, or making a dash to one of the many coffee shops we frequent.\nThese quick and convenient meals don’t leave me feeling good, though, and I’m becoming a bit more conscious about what I’m putting into my body now, as compared to my more youthful years.\nWith home-cooked meals, I can at least have some control over my diet. But how do you find time to prepare something healthy in the midst of a busy work week?\nFor this column, I spoke to nutritionists and chefs for some tips and good practices to observe to make this possible.\nOne question I asked chefs Jeremy Cheok and Isaac Henry was: What are some must-haves in terms of appliances and ingredients that should have a place in a busy Singaporean’s kitchen?\nThese are their suggestions:\n1. A PRESSURE COOKER\nMr Cheok, the Asia-Pacific business head of food technology company Live Green Co, said that this device can cut down cooking times by up to a third.\n“Imagine a six-hour stew ready in the time it takes to watch a movie,” he said.\n“It also helps cut down your food bill by letting you work with tough cuts like shin and oxtail that are usually cheaper than prime cuts.”\nMr Cheok was formerly the founder and managing director of Slake restaurant, which first opened its doors in Opera Estate.\n2. CANNED FISH\nSardines, salmon or tuna? It doesn’t really matter, Mr Cheok said.\nWhat matters, he added, is that they are a quick and convenient source of protein that can be added to salads or pastas without worrying about defrosting or having it go bad in the fridge.\n3. ROCKET LEAVES\nThese salad greens last a decent amount of time in the fridge — up to a week if stored with paper towels to absorb moisture, Mr Cheok said.\n“And it makes most slapped-together meals look fancy. Also, the bitterness (from the leaves) helps provide a foil to the typically acidic diet we have.”\n4. READY-MADE SALAD DRESSING\nPersonally, my go-to dressing would be a balsamic vinegar and olive oil combination with wasabi and honey, but Mr Cheok said that ready-made dressings are not a bad idea either, since they can last for some time and come in a wide variety of flavours.\n5. SALT, SUGAR AND VINEGAR\nSalt and sugar are two ingredients most people would already have in their pantry, but it is also worthwhile to include vinegar as well.\nMr Henry, who has worked in kitchens such as Stellar at 1-Altitude, said that these are key ingredients for pickling foods such as carrots, tomatoes and cabbages, which can go some way to complementing savoury foods.\nPickling is easy, Mr Henry said. You just follow the ratio of three parts water, two parts sugar and one part vinegar. Salt is added to taste.\n“Technically, the only thing that will cost you time is measuring everything out and cutting your vegetables. Put it in there, bottle it up and it will keep forever,” he said, adding that it takes up to six hours for the pickled vegetables to be ready for consumption.\nOf course, having tools at your disposal is not enough to ensure that you can whip up a hearty meal at the end of a long working day. One convenient strategy that Mr Cheok proposed is to prepare meals in bulk for the week.\nHowever, when I broached this idea with my partner, she demurred because she was concerned about food safety and the potential loss in nutritional value.\nSo I did what any reasonable person would do to win an argument — I asked the experts.\nBy and large, two nutritionists I interviewed — Dr Jaclyn Reutens, a clinical and sports dietitian at Aptima Nutrition and Sports Consultants, and Mr Chan Joy Seng, an accredited nutritionist at Alive Nutrition Consultancy — said that there is not much to worry about, if proper food hygiene is observed.\nHowever, as Mr Chan pointed out, eating the same meal for several days could lead to monotony.\nThis is where herbs and spices can come in handy to modify the flavour of the meals and add some variety, he said.\nAnd since it requires some planning, Dr Reutens said that it can be a good option for people hoping to have appropriately portioned and nutritionally balanced meals throughout the week.\n“It eliminates impulsive unhealthy food choices as there is always food readily available,” he reasoned.\nHere’s a summary of some other points that the nutritionists raised about preparing meals in bulk.\nHOW MUCH FOOD SHOULD I BE PREPARING?\nBetween four and seven meals, depending on the size of one’s refrigerator and schedule for the week.\nWHAT SHOULD I BEAR IN MIND?\nTo ensure the body gets a range of nutrients, Mr Chan said that it is important to have ingredients from all the food groups: Grains, proteins, vegetables and fruits.\nWhen pre-cooking vegetables, Dr Reutens suggested choosing hardy ones such as carrots and celery that will not change colour with prolonged cooking.\n“Don’t forget there will be a final round of heating either in the microwave or stove,” she said.\nFor that same reason, she also said that meat, poultry and seafood should be cooked till just about done, before freezing them.\nBut if it’s a stew, do not worry about overcooking these since they need to be slow-cooked for at least an hour.\nThe nutritionists added that it is possible to also consider pre-cutting vegetables such as carrots, pumpkins and mushrooms, rather than pre-cooking them.\nGreen leafy vegetables, however, are not suitable for bulk preparation since they do not last long, Mr Chan said.\nAside from that, Dr Reutens added that the texture of these vegetables will be altered with freezing and reheating. For the same reason, other ingredients to avoid include soft tofu and thin slices of fish.\nWHAT ARE SOME MEAL IDEAS WITH ALL THE MAIN FOOD GROUPS?\nChicken stew with potatoes\nSpaghetti bolognese\nSlow-cooked creamy parmesan chicken with couscous\nHoney garlic beef rice bowl with broccoli\nMashed potato with oven-baked salmon and vegetables\nWILL BULK-PREPPED MEALS LOSE NUTRITIONAL VALUE OVER TIME?\nAny nutritional loss will be minimal, both nutritionists said.\nMr Chan said that there will be a loss of vitamins C and B1, since they are the most sensitive to oxidation.\nHowever, Dr Reutens said that one can still get a healthy dose of vitamin C from eating fruit after meals anyway.\nAs for B vitamins, which she said are water soluble, they are generally lost in the cooking liquid, but can be retained if the cooking liquid is reused in the sauce.\n“Other vitamins and minerals like vitamin A, D, fibre, carbohydrates and protein are well-retained,” she added.\nHOW LONG CAN THE FOOD BE KEPT?\nDr Reutens said that after cooking, food has to be kept in the freezer or chiller within two hours to reduce the risk of harmful pathogens from growing.\n“If you are eating the food tomorrow, you can keep it in the chiller. Anything past 24 hours should be moved straight to the freezer.”\nOnce in the freezer, it can be kept for up to three months, she added.\nARE THERE ANY HEALTH CONCERNS ABOUT USING A MICROWAVE TO REHEAT FOOD?\nIn short, there is nothing to be concerned about, the nutritionists said.\n“You have to understand how it works,” Dr Reutens said. “The microwaves excite the water particles in the food to a high temperature and that reheats the food. No microwaves are retained in the food.”\nOn occasions, I have forgotten to transfer a piece of frozen meat from the freezer to the chiller, and decided to just leave it on the countertop so that it can thaw quickly.\nThis is a bad idea, the nutritionists said, because there is a higher risk of food-borne pathogens growing on the meat at room temperature.\nIdeally, the frozen meat should be thawed overnight in a refrigerator, but if one is short on time, Mr Chan suggested using a microwave, or an oven set to a very low temperature, to defrost it.\nAlternatively, he said that it is also possible to put the frozen meat in a storage bag and submerge it in water.\nMr Chan also said that fresh poultry, seafood, as well as minced and organ meats should be kept in the chiller only if it will be consumed within one to two days. If there are no immediate plans to do so, it should be kept in the freezer instead.\nFor red meat, it should only be stored in the chiller for three to five days before consumption.\nEven though these are all practical ideas and suggestions, I know there will be occasions when I just want an easy way out in preparing my own meals.\nOne other takeaway I got from my conversation with chef Henry is that depending on my choices, this may not necessarily be a bad thing.\nFor example, a whole roast chicken bought from the supermarket can be used over several meals, and the bones can even be used for making chicken stock.\nIntrigued, I gave his suggestion a go. The meat was enough to last me for about four meals and I got about two litres of stock — all for around S$13.\nGiven that I do cook at least one meal over the weekend, I'll consider spending more time in the kitchen to ensure that there is healthy, tasty food available to last over the week.\nNow, I just need to get enough containers to store it.\nABOUT THE WRITER:\nLow Youjin is a senior journalist at TODAY where he covers the environment, manpower, as well as the court and crime beats."

            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — Once, teatime with a close friend turned into an argument, because she took offence at a remark I made.\nThe offensive statement?  \n\"I am okay. Just relaxing myself.\"\nI said this while teary-eyed and clearly affected by woes relating to family and personal life, believing that by putting on a brave front, I was being a responsible friend.\nWhen she took offence, I explained: \"If I told you clearly and exactly what I felt, I would be burdening you with my issues.\"\nFar from being convinced, she replied that if I were more direct and honest to my friends about how I really felt, I would be more respected.\nI was not entirely taken aback hearing her words. It was not the first time I had had people remarking that they didn't think they were getting the \"real\" me.\nI used to wonder what they were making a fuss about, but this week, I decided to tackle the issue head on by speaking to therapists about why I find it so difficult to express my honest feelings so vulnerably, even to the people I love most.\nTruth be told, this difficulty comes from a fear of offending people, which stems from having to accommodate to temperamental people close to me since early childhood.\nFeeling rattled and anxious most of the time, I grew up believing that people constantly need to hear calming, soothing words and that I should never rock the boat with harsh truths.\nSo even as I got older, whenever I was asked a question about anything, from what food I would like to what movie I would like to watch, I would demur and say things like, “You choose”, thinking that it would make the person happier.\nAt times, I tried to cover up my inadequate actions with words. For example, when I forgot to do my homework, I would tell teachers that I had done it but did not take it to school, thinking that this would make them less angry. In the end, it made no difference. \nAnother manifestation of my people-pleasing ways was that I would over-extend myself. I would, for example, agree to help out in co-curricular activities at school but then fall short of my promises.\nIn university, I could not manage all my commitments and failed to allocate enough time to project work, earning the ire of my teammates.\nThroughout the years, my communication style turned roundabout and awkward. I even found myself resorting to lies in order to avoid causing further offence to people I had angered. \nAnd conversely, I also found myself seeking validation and comfort from other people’s words.\nThis meant that I ended up giving more priority to people who said what I loved to hear, but who did not truly understand me and my values. I allowed myself to be cajoled by these people into several unpleasant situations.\nOver time, I realised that this was unhealthy and as I started correcting several of these habits, I grew to treasure direct and straightforward communication from friends and loved ones.\nYet, I still could not bring myself to deliver the same in return.\nMs Theresa Pong, counselling director of The Relationship Room, said that generally, how comfortable an individual is with being open to another depends on a concept called “Differentiation of Self (DoS)”.  \nIt is important for individuals to have a strong sense of DoS because it helps them maintain their own thoughts and emotions even in the face of pressure from people around them, she said.\n“In other words, if we are able to develop a strong DoS, it means that we are able to recognise our needs and wants and maintain our individuality (personal identity) and not lose ourselves in the process of protecting the relationship with the other party,\" Ms Pong explained.\nIndividuals with a higher level of DoS are less likely to conform to the needs and wants of others if it goes against their own interest, and they are more likely to stand up for themselves.\nSo how does one develop a solid DoS?\n“First, you may wish to take time to reflect on who you are and how you want to live your life,\" Ms Pong said. \"Having an understanding of these areas is the first step to developing a healthy self.\" \nSecond, she said, be aware of who you are and do not change according to whose company you keep.\nThird, she added, think long-term.\n“For instance, ask yourself, 'If I continue to stay this way, holding my emotions and not sharing my frustration, what will happen to me and this relationship?'\"\nShe added that for people who find it difficult to develop a strong sense of DoS on their own, they could seek professional help, perhaps from a counsellor or therapist.\nOn opening up to others, psychotherapist Narasimman Tivasiha Mani said that individuals who are more passive in their communication style usually fail to express their feelings or needs, allowing others to express themselves.\n\"They might behave indifferently or yield to others to avoid confrontation or conflict,\" he added.\nPeople also adopt a more passive communication style when they feel threatened or do not feel psychologically safe, he noted. \nThis means that they might withhold information, which can then lead to misunderstandings or an inaccurate representation of the situation, he said.\nTo break this pattern, he advised taking ownership of one's thoughts and feelings by using “I” statements, such as “I feel frustrated when you speak to me in that tone”.\nThis communicates ownership of feelings and behaviours without blaming the other individual, he explained.\nHe also noted the importance of communicating one's boundaries safely, and learning to simply say \"no\".\nA person also has to be mindful of their own emotional state when faced with a difficult conversation, he added, because it is important to be calm while communicating assertively.\nMs Stephanie Tak, a counsellor with Mind What Matters, a psychological consultancy, said that self-love is ultimately the foundation to making the change.\n\"Remind yourself that you are enough just as you are! Your truth should be enough for those who love you,\" she said.\n\"Even though what you say may not immediately please the other person, being dishonest about what you really think or want is denying yourself of what you think matters.\"\nWhile I find it relatively easy to practise these changes in ordinary, low-pressure situations, I think that the true test will lie in high-pressure situations.\nWill I be able to hold on to these newly acquired values during periods of heightened anxiety or will I crumble? Only time will tell. \nI have to admit I find it embarrassing that even though I am in my 30s, I am still figuring out how to communicate like an adult. \nYet, I have also found that the pain of growing can itself be profoundly calming.\n\nJanarthanan Krishnasamy is a TODAY journalist who writes about health, sports, community and social issues and the arts."

            "Article Body": "Adulthood is an invigorating stage of life as young people join the workforce, take on more responsibilities and set their sights on the future. But its many facets — from managing finances and buying a home to achieving work-life balance — can be overwhelming.\nIn this series, TODAY’s journalists help young Singaporeans navigate this stage of their lives and learn something themselves in the process.\nSINGAPORE — “Only going home now?” the office security guard asked, as I trudged out of the building just after midnight on a Saturday night, with a stack of books and laptop in hand. \nThough they were brief, I had come to treasure the conversations I had with him as the fun weekends I used to spend out with my friends had become a relentless string of nights spent staring at screens, studying and working in the office. \nLast year, I was working a part-time internship position at a strategic advisory firm and contributing to a media outlet while completing my final semester at university. \nThis was coupled up with occasional volunteer commitments and virtual Chinese lessons to brush up my spoken Mandarin. It was all work and little or no play.\nThe fatigue finally caught up with me at the end of the year. I was usually able to shake off these feelings of weariness, or even at times, relish in them.\nInstead, I felt riddled with self-doubt, weighed down by thoughts that I would never become the person I had so aspired to be.  \nDespite these feelings, I told myself that I was just tired and that so many of my peers were doing much more than me.\nAfter all, some had school fees they had to pay off but still managed to get top grades in school, others were grappling with major personal issues but could still land internships at prestigious firms. \nIn the light of all this, were my feelings normal or was there something more to it? \nDeep down, I knew that there was more to my twenties than late nights spent alone in the office, coffee after coffee, planning to cross the next goal off the list and the one after that, and so on. \nFor this column, I spoke to counsellors and mental health experts to find out more about what it means to be burnt out, how this has been perpetuated by “hustle culture” and healthy ways to address these issues. \nHustle culture, which a New York Times article has dubbed as the new work culture, suggests that beyond just going through the motions of a job, workers should love what they do and advertise that love on social media platforms. \nIt glorifies keeping busy and going after more —  whether it’s a bigger paycheque, title or promotion. \nThis, in turn, also creates a sense of “Fomo” for some, or a fear of missing out. People don’t want to be left behind while their peers advance in their careers or pick up trading to make big bucks from the stock market. \nMental health experts I interviewed said that this constant pursuit of more, and the sense of Fomo comes from something deeper, beyond a desire for greater professional development.\nMs Ng Ai Ling, the head of counselling and principal psychotherapist at Eagles Mediation and Counselling Centre, said: “Fomo happens when we feel a sense of insecurity within ourselves, and we are afraid of the competition in the world that we live in.\n\"We are too worried about falling behind in the rat race and we push ourselves, sometimes beyond our limits or comfort, to do what others are doing.” \nIn a similar vein, Mr Cho Ming Xiu, founder of Campus PSY (Peer Support for Youths), a non-profit organisation that promotes mental health awareness, said that many people tie their self-worth and identity to their academic performance or professional accomplishments. \nHe added that those who lack a strong sense of self-identity may be more susceptible to social pressures.\nDescribing it as a vicious circle, Mr Cho said that he has had youths tell him that seeing their friends make big strides in their professional or academic journeys creates a fear that they will not be able to achieve their goals if they do not buck up. \nThis sounded a lot like a friend of mine, who juggled an internship at a prestigious bank with his studies, all while taking part in case competitions. He said that he did this because of a “credential inflation” where he feels that educational qualifications alone aren’t enough. \nDespite having a glowing resume, he said that he is also driven a lot by self-doubt. “It’s like if I don’t pursue this internship, whatever I learn in the classroom is not going to be good enough, so I felt like I needed to join these companies to strengthen my core competencies.” \nA central question I struggled with when those feeling of fatigue swamped me last year was trying to tell whether I was “just tired” or burnt out. \nThough I withdrew from my friends and gave up most of my hobbies, such as reading or exercising, I often told myself that it was because I was just too tired and would be able to get around to these things at a different time. \nThe career coach and therapists I spoke to for this piece said that one of the signs of burnout is that the fatigue does not go away even after getting a good night’s sleep. \nMs Ng said that those who are burnt out would feel fatigue in all three aspects of their well-being: Physical, emotional and mental. \nShe said: “When you are feeling tired, you can get back to work after some good rest. But when you begin to feel burnt out, you feel excessive and prolonged physical, emotional and mental stress.\n“You have difficulty sleeping or eating or may suffer gastrological problems such as irritable bowel syndrome. You feel overwhelmed, powerless and helpless.”\nThinking back, I realise now that even though I was overworking myself and constantly pushing myself to do better and achieve more, it had made me feel more lost than I was before. \nI began to question why I had embarked on these internship roles and courses in the first place and if I was truly passionate about them — because if I was, then why did it take so much for me to get out of bed every morning?   \nSo how should I have dealt with all these feelings in a hyper-competitive environment? Experts tell me it's important to speak to others about what you’re going through and centre yourself.  \nThe mental health experts emphasised the importance of speaking up, though this may be difficult as such heavy workloads have already been normalised. \nMr John Shepherd Lim, the chief well-being officer of Singapore Counselling Centre, said: “This can make it hard for people to vocalise their struggles with burnout, as they might compare with the drive and pace of life that others seem to be coping well with, and fear being seen as weak. \n“This judgement of being ‘weak’ can be self-imposed or implied through the attitudes their social circles might hold towards individuals who struggle with the work entrusted to them.” \nHe added that the need to maintain this image is something that many young adults take seriously, as they are still in the process of establishing their self-esteem and life goals. \n“There has been often an observed discrepancy between student awareness of avenues of mental health support and usage of said avenues — people prefer handling the burnout on their own rather than seek help from their colleagues and friends around them,” he said. \nMs Samantha Ng, career coach, said that it is important to take some time to realign with yourself, in terms of your values, career and goals. \nShe added that it is important to set boundaries and manage our own expectations. \n“Burnout does not occur overnight, it is always a build-up of events and emotions. For example, if I know that I am only going to be extremely stressed out if I have to work with ultra-tight deadlines, then minimise the probability of that happening by proper planning and strong execution,” she said. \nMr Cho from Campus PSY gave a piece of advice that resonated with me — he advised that I find my own “anchor”, which is something that serves as a guiding force in the decisions we make and will continue to ground us through difficult times. \nFor him, his anchor is his faith. He said: “If you have certain anchors in life, it will really help you rethink why you do what you do. Being achievement-oriented is not something that is bad but when it goes over a certain boundary where it eats into your life, then you have to re-think if this is something you want to continue.” \nAfter our conversation, I reflected on what my “anchor” was and if I even had one. I had undertaken these internships, extra courses and volunteer programmes all in the name of self-development: Improve my writing or my conversational Chinese skills or knowledge in certain topics. \nThe pursuit of self-development had crossed a threshold without my realisation, and I was mindlessly chasing after the idea of an elusive “better”. \nMy once-concrete goals became less clear to me and instead, I was trying so hard to become a blurred ideal I conjured up in my head. \nIt took me three months of uninterrupted rest — where I deactivated my social media accounts and dedicated time to things I enjoyed — before I began to feel more like my old self again. \nNow, to avoid going down the same rabbit hole, I try to pace myself. \nBefore signing up for a course, I try to think about what I want to gain from it and if it is something that I would enjoy learning. I also make time in my week for friends, family and hobbies. \nWhile it is unlikely that hustle culture or feeling Fomo will go away any time soon, I’ve realised that it is important to centre ourselves, in order to prevent getting swept away by the currents of social pressures or self-doubt.

But its many facets — from managing finances and buying a home to achieving work-life balance — can be overwhelming.\nIn this series, TODAY’s journalists help young Singaporeans navigate this stage of their lives and learn something themselves in the process.\nSINGAPORE — It’s 12am, I’m in bed watching the latest season of Stranger Things on Netflix and I have arrived yet again at the same dilemma I face every night: Do I hit the \"next episode\" button (this last one ended on another cliffhanger…) or do I pick the sensible option of switching off my lights and going to bed? \nUnfortunately, most of the time, I choose the former, knowing full well that the happiness derived from watching another few episodes will come at a cost — waking up the next morning with a pounding headache and feeling like a zombie the entire day. \nWhen I was a university student, sleeping late didn’t affect me as much since I had more control over my schedule. I signed up for classes that took place later in the day, and I could generally choose what time to wake up each day and finish my assignments.\nSince I started working, though, I've had to give up that control — I don't get to choose what news assignments to cover and some days, I might have to attend media briefings or rush down to the site of a breaking news event as early as 8am. \nSince then, my sleep habits have deteriorated.\nNow that I have less free time in the day, I find myself sleeping later so I can squeeze in more activities before bed, such as playing video games, scrolling through TikTok or watching YouTube videos of cute dogs.\nAnd even though it's taking a toll on my health, I can’t seem to help myself and I know I’m not the only one stuck in this loop. \nA study by senior research fellow Stijn Massar and Dr Michael Chee from the Sleep and Cognition Laboratory at the National University of Singapore (NUS) found that out of the 321 adolescents, university students and staff they surveyed over the past two years, 55 per cent said that they frequently go to bed later than intended. \nIn an effort to figure out how to break my unhealthy patterns, I spoke to some experts. \nThe term “bedtime procrastination” was first used in 2014 by Dutch researchers to explain how a lack of self-discipline results in people sleeping later than intended. \nLater, the word “revenge” was added to the term by users on Chinese social media, giving it a layer of extra meaning. \nDr Leow Leong Chai, director of the sleep disorders unit at Singapore General Hospital, said that “revenge bedtime procrastination” was coined to describe people who are so busy with work and other commitments that they do not have any time for activities that they enjoy.\n“In other words, they take 'revenge' on their busy work and social life by knowingly procrastinating their bedtime so that they can do what they enjoy instead of going to sleep,” he added. \nAgreeing, Dr Chee from NUS said that this is exacerbated by the pull of social media, which makes it difficult for people to put down their phones. \n“People may want to spend a bit of ‘me time’ by using social media before bed, but the time just passes because the content that’s offered online is so compelling.”\nDr Chee is the director of Centre for Sleep and Cognition at the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine in NUS.\nHe added that the sole goal of social media developers is to “capture your attention and hold it” and they “will find every way to hook you”.\n“They aren’t going to think about your mental well-being and loss of sleep,” Dr Chee said.  \nThis is something I personally struggle with and a friend I spoke to also mentioned that she uses Instagram to “wind down” before bed but ends up getting carried away with it. \n“Screen time is so bad, I usually start to wind down at 11pm but before I know it, two hours have passed,” she said. \nOther than revenge bedtime procrastination, certain people may delay sleeping because they find sleep to be a waste of time.\nMs Ng Ai Ling, the head of counselling and principal psychotherapist at Eagles Mediation and Counselling Centre, said: “For those who espouse the Fomo (fear of missing out) and Yolo (you only live once) philosophy, sleeping is an unproductive time during which they could be losing out to their peers.”\nThis fear drives them to work harder in order to keep up with others, which could be through pursuing social and leisure interests.\nFor others, an eagerness to achieve may drive them to sacrifice sleep, so that they can use the time to take on side gigs or part-time studies after their day job, she added.  \nIn order to break the habit and start sleeping on time, Ms Ng suggested reflecting on these questions to help identify the underlying cause of bedtime procrastination: \n“For example, the underlying issue may be a lack of clarity about your purpose in life. You could then address this by going for professional coaching or counselling, which would be more helpful than staying up late to scroll through social media,” she said.  \nThese questions got me thinking as well and I realised that the weeks when I struggle the most with bedtime procrastination are the ones when I am more stressed at work. \nThis translates into staying up late in order to extend my \"me time\" and \"delay\" the next day from arriving, which is not a healthy way to manage stress. \nSo what do I have to do differently?\nFor working adults, Dr Chee recommended going to bed before midnight so that they are able to have the recommended seven to eight hours of sleep. He added that having a healthy diet and sufficient exercise are also important. \nYet, we all know this is all easier said than done, and Dr Chee himself acknowledged that the problem is also a structural one, which requires a societal level change. \n“In Singapore, we have a culture where work and personal time is blurred… As a boss myself, I try not to contact my staff after office hours as it will eat into their personal time,\" he added. \nWhen people are contacted about work outside of their office hours, they might sleep even later to make up for the lost free time. \nExperts noted that sleep habits worsened as a result of the pandemic, because working from home eroded work-life boundaries.\nTo counter this, Ms Ng recommended that those who work from home set a routine to disengage from work daily. For example, one could leave home for a walk to simulate ending work for the day. \n“During the walk, think about what you are going to do after that. The walk back will help to disengage you from work,” she said. \nShe added that keeping your bedroom as a resting space and working in the living room instead is another tangible way to separate work and rest. \nA friend of mine has another good strategy to prevent work stress from affecting her sleep.\nShe said: “I see it more as energy management. If there’s an event or a deadline at work, I’ll try to work on it in advance so that I can sleep earlier the night before instead of stressing over it.”\nThis gives her enough energy to get through that important day, she said, adding that she regularly sleeps early because it feels really good to wake up fresh. \nAlthough I am not quite there yet, I’ll try changing my habits step by step.\nPerhaps I’ll try stopping the episode of my Netflix show midway — once the cliffhanger from the previous episode has been resolved — so I don’t get tempted to watch yet another episode when it inevitably ends on a cliffhanger.\nThis will be easier said than done, but I have to remind myself that the effort and discipline will be worth it. I look forward to the days when I wake up fresh and am able to fully enjoy my time after work, instead of feeling terribly exhausted the entire day. \n \nABOUT THE WRITER:\nCharlene Goh, 25, is a journalist with TODAY, covering health, sports, community and the arts."

            "Article Body": "Adulthood is an invigorating stage of life as young people join the workforce, take on more responsibilities and set their sights on the future. But its many facets — from managing finances and buying a home to achieving work-life balance — can be overwhelming.\nIn this series, TODAY’s journalists help young Singaporeans navigate this stage of their lives and learn something themselves in the process.\nIt is 6am. My husband and I are jolted awake, bleary-eyed, by the sound of wailing outside our bedroom door.\nThis scenario played out almost every day and we were almost at our wit’s end. Then, in the nick of time, a friend’s brother gifted us the holy grail… An automatic feeder.\nThe wailing culprit is not a child, though we would argue that she is our kid, or rather, furkid. Her name is Biscuit and she is one of three cats that we adopted within the past two years, each with its own unique personalities and quirks.\nWe got them shortly after getting married in late-2019. It had always been our dream to have pets because our parents had banned them from our childhood homes, apart from the occasional fish or terrapin turtles.\n\nWhen we got married and moved into our own home, it was understood that we would be adding pets to our living space. \nWhen it comes to children, however, we are not so firmly decided.\nI am at the age where many of my peers are tying the knot and having kids, and although I've done the former, I have never had a strong desire to do the latter.\nBut I am gradually embracing the idea that if it happens, I'll be okay with it. And this is partly due to my cats — being a “pawrent” has helped me to visualise what life might be like if I ever do become a mother.\nA disclaimer: I’m not saying that pets are just like human children. I know they are very different creatures. I am simply saying that there are certain routines I have had to accustom myself to, which have given me a tiny sneak peek behind the child parenting curtain.\nCats have strict feeding schedules, shed fur everywhere, track cat litter all over the floor and often act up whenever they want. They depend on you for almost all their needs, can cost exorbitant amounts of money and when they are young almost every waking moment is spent taking care of them.\nAfter two years as a \"pawrent\", one of the biggest things I’ve learned is that things will inevitably go wrong and you have to work with your partner or resentment will breed. It is also impossible for everything to be perfect, no matter what it may look like on social media.\nSee? There are some similarities.\nMy husband and I adopted Biscuit and another cat, Bluebell, in 2020. We had only ever fed community cats in our parents’ neighbourhoods on and off, so needless to say, it was initially a bit of a shock to have two little lives suddenly be dependent on us.\nBoth came to us while suffering from feline flu that they had picked up from their fosterer’s home and required a lot of “sayang”, or care, to get them used to their new environment.\nBiscuit, only six months old at the time, was extremely mischievous. In fact, she still is now. \nShe is extremely food-driven, hence her wailing for kibble in the mornings, and has broken numerous ceramic food bowls from running around the house at high speeds. We call her the young punk of the household.\nWhen we were stuck at home during the Covid-19 circuit breaker period, she would persistently meow or “cry” whenever we were in virtual interviews or meetings. I once covered a High Court hearing over Zoom and could barely hear the judge speaking over her. We had to put her in lockdown in another room.\nNonetheless, they have brought us so much joy. Our mobile phone photo galleries began bursting with photos and videos of them, and whenever we had a stressful day at work, they would inevitably do something to make us laugh.\nWe adopted a third cat, Bobby, early last year after finding him wandering around near the peak of Mount Faber. We tried for a while to find out if he was abandoned or had run away from home, and finally got in touch with his feeder, who revealed that his microchip has been issued as part of the trap, neuter and release programme.\nWe took him in. But being a big climber, he soon smashed several things in our house. He was also riddled with fleas from being outside, which we had to meticulously comb out and treat with medication.\nBluebell developed an eye infection at one point which necessitated multiple trips to the vet. She remains the most \"scaredy-cat\" one but has come out of her shell a lot, even taking to perching on people's laps as long as they stay still.\nAs for Biscuit, she got much better after we got the automatic feeder, but she has recently learned to dig more food out of it than her allocated portion so we have to monitor her when we can.\nOnce, when we bought canned cat food online from our usual supplier, our cats began vomiting because it was nearly expired. We had to scramble to get new food and fretted over whether to take them to the vet. Luckily, they got better on their own.\nWhen I got into houseplants, I also had to research pet- or child-friendly plants out of fear that they would chew on toxic ones and fall ill.\nWhile caring for our cats and learning to deal with their idiosyncrasies, we often found ourselves saying: “This is like practice for having kids.”\nKnowing how difficult it really is for parents of human children, we didn’t say it lightly.\nI spoke to a friend, Michelle, who has both a kid and a furkid, and an acquaintance who has a cat and no plans to have children.\nMichelle, a civil servant, said that she and her husband initially struggled to care for both their dog — a four-year-old shih tzu named Monkey (apparently because they think his bark sounds like a monkey’s cry, though I disagree) — and their newborn son at the same time.\nBut she agreed that caring for the canine, which they'd had for two years before welcoming their kid, had prepared her in some ways.\nMore specifically, she said that Monkey had a peeing problem and they got used to cleaning up after the dog. “Not that (our son) pees and poops everywhere, but it was like we already had one baby that was more 'jialat' (Hokkien for ‘drain energy’), so it kind of geared us up,” she told me.\nMy acquaintance, who is also in the media industry, said he dismissed the idea of having children a while ago. His fiancee comes from a big family and agrees with him that they should not have their own kids.\nHe got a cat some time back and that cemented his decision, he added. Taking care of her gives him all the parental fulfilment and satisfaction he needs.\nLuckily for him, his parents are fine with his decision to remain childless as they already have grandchildren.\nAs for me, I am not sure what life has in store for me on the parenthood front  — maybe someday I will give birth to a child, or maybe I won't and my husband and I might adopt more pets. \nEither way, I feel like our current set-up has helped me to embrace the messiness and joy of family life, whoever the members may be. \nABOUT THE WRITER:\nLouisa Tang is a senior journalist at TODAY, where she covers court, crime and legal issues."

This creates tension between both parties.\"\nHowever, Ms Theresa Pong, counselling director of The Relationship Room, said that the tension is not just because of Asian cultures as such conflict happens around the world.\nOther reasons for conflict may stem from empty nest syndrome — where parents feel a sense of loneliness as their children leave the home.\n\"If (parents are) unable to cope well with this syndrome, we see issues with parents overstepping boundaries as they will try to intervene with their adult children, even though they are already independent,\" she added.\nShe also said that parents-in-law may mean well, but are misunderstood, such as seemingly bragging about their extended family when they simply want to help their children-in-law assimilate to the family.\nNoting that conflicts between parents-in-law and couples stem from different expectations and misunderstandings, the counsellors acknowledged that communication can help resolve tension, if done right.\n\"Conflict often starts because there are emotions involved, and both parties are reacting to each other,\" said Ms Pong.\n\"Be mindful of your tone and start your sentence with 'I' instead of 'you', so you don't come across as confrontational.\"\nMs Pong also advised that when conflict arises between the in-laws, spouses should avoid becoming \"messenger boys\".\n\"Miscommunication and misconception may arise when there's no direct communication. If you aren't confident in addressing the issue, stay calm and ask your spouse to be there when having a conversation,\" she said.\nMr Joshua Koh said that this is known as triangulation — where a conflict doesn't involve them necessarily, but their identity makes them play a role in it — and it can be exhausting for the spouse.\nBut rather than take sides, he said it's important for spouses to carefully navigate the tricky situation, and diffuse the situation without criticising either parent or partner.\n\"It's important to listen to validate their concerns and feelings... and avoid polarised thinking about which party is right or wrong,\" he said.\n\"Conflict (between spouses and parents-in-law) often arises from a situation where there is no right answer... the goal is to find a way to move on or find common ground.\"\nHe also emphasised that it is important to address issues with kindness and respect to maintain a healthy relationship.\nOn conflicts between wives and their mother-in-laws, Mr Gary Koh said that when all else fails, husbands should support their wives for a healthy relationship. \nThe counsellors advised young couples like my boyfriend and I, who have yet to tie the knot, to set the foundations early to establish a strong relationship with their parents-in-law.\nWhen asked when is the best time to set boundaries with in-laws, Mr Joshua Koh said \"as soon as possible, even before marriage\".\n\"When married, sometimes we create 'superficial harmony' where we comply against our will to keep the peace. But by having a discussion before marriage about our expectations and perspectives, it can be helpful in understanding each other,\" he added.\nHe suggested that couples should also discuss with each other about the following topics and set expectations between themselves, before communicating them to their parents-in-law:\nAside from these points, Ms Pong also said that a healthy relationship can be established while in courtship through natural curiosity about each other and their families.\n\"It's good to know about your significant other's family of origin, so you don't get a shock when conflict arises after making a life-long commitment to each other,\" she said, adding that a family's lifestyle and how they bond with each other is important to know.\nFor example, some families may bond through conversations with each other over dinner, while others do so by watching television shows while eating.\n\"Getting to know your in-laws and establishing a good relationship takes time, just like when you get to know your partner,\" said Ms Koh.\n\"Since it takes effort to know your partner, why not take time to learn about their parents and family, too?\"\nWith this advice in mind, I think a sit down with my parents-in-law to be would be necessary so we can start on the right foot when my boyfriend and I tie the knot.\nBut first, I need to muster the courage to do so.\nABOUT THE WRITER:\nLoraine Lee, 23, is a journalist at TODAY, covering environment, housing and education."

But its many facets — from managing finances and buying a home to achieving work-life balance — can be overwhelming.\nIn this series, TODAY’s journalists help young Singaporeans navigate this stage of their lives and learn something themselves in the process.\nSINGAPORE — A month ago, my editor assigned me to investigate a potential news story about personal loans and I realised I was clueless when it came to the topic — if there was ever a need for me to take out one in the future, I would not know where to start.\nThis was slightly concerning, given that I hit my mid-20s this year and will probably move on to my next season in life soon, which means possibly taking out a loan for big-ticket items such as a wedding or home renovation. \nWhile Googling about loans, I learnt that one in three young adults in Singapore had “unmanageable debt”, according to a study by the Citi Foundation-SMU Financial Literacy Programme for Young Adults, which surveyed 1,068 respondents aged between 18 and 30 from March to April last year on topics such as debt and savings.\nThey had asked the respondents to provide an estimate of their total amount of debt, including credit cards, student loans and other debts, but excluding mortgage and property loans.\nThey then compared this against their monthly household incomes to measure their ability to repay their debts.  \nCurious, I approached the director of the programme, Professor Aurobindo Ghosh, to find out why such a significant proportion of young Singaporeans had unmanageable debt, and he said that there are three common reasons:\nFirstly, a lack of clear understanding of budgeting and tracking expenses, exacerbated by the fact that the distinction between needs and wants is getting blurred with more targeted advertisements on social media and elsewhere. \n“‘Keeping up with the Joneses and Yolo (You Only Live Once) attitudes might lead young people to take up unsustainable debt to meet personal consumption expenditure,” said Prof Ghosh, who is also an assistant professor of finance education at Singapore Management University (SMU). \nSecondly, the pandemic might have also reduced real income, or income after accounting for inflation, which could have led young people to spend higher amounts or borrowing money to make up for the shortfall.  \nFinally, rampant use of borrowing tools including credit cards and buy-now-pay-later schemes without understanding the implications of borrowing might also increase the total amount of debt for young adults who are also more likely to use technology, Prof Ghosh said.  \nHaving learnt all this, I then spoke to some financial experts to better understand loans.\nA personal loan is an unsecured loan, meaning that it is not backed by an asset. It is different from a housing and car loan, for which, in the event that a borrower is unable to return the amount, the bank has the ability to seize the asset. \nA personal loan can be used for a range of purposes such as home renovations or purchasing electronics, and how much you can borrow is based on your ability to repay it, which is influenced by factors such as your monthly salary and credit report. \nBanks may request for your credit report to assess your “creditworthiness”, or your ability to pay back a loan before granting you one, explained Ms Lorna Tan, the head of financial planning literacy at DBS Bank.   \nFor banks in Singapore, only two credit bureaus are allowed to obtain such information: Credit Bureau Singapore and Experian Credit Bureau Singapore.\nThe credit report includes information such as records of all credit checks made on you, credit repayment trend for the past 12 months, including late payments on credit card bills, default records and bankruptcy records, if any.\nA few factors could affect your credit rating: \nUntil now, I did not realise that enquiry activity was a factor that affected one's creditworthiness. Indeed, Ms Tan advised to “only enquire about credit when you need it”.\nBut Mr Erik Ligtenberg, the chief operating officer of online loan match-making platform Lendela, said that this is problematic as the interest rates for many personal loans shown on bank websites are usually generic ones.\nBorrowers would have to apply directly to the bank in order to receive a customised interest rate based on their circumstances and credit rating.  \n“People end up getting ‘punished’ for shopping around and ‘punished’ for comparing different loans as these activities show up on the credit report,” said Mr Ligtenberg, whose company allows users to receive customised interest rates from various banks by submitting a single application on its website, without getting the loan enquiries registered on their credit report.\n \n1. Be clear about the type of loan you need \n“When choosing a loan, it is important that it is fit for purpose,” said Ms Tan. \nFor instance, if you simply need a short-term loan to facilitate payments until the next pay cheque, a credit card might be enough instead of taking a personal loan. \nOn the other hand, for someone who is pursuing further studies, a study loan may be better instead of borrowing through credit cards, which have higher interest rates. \n2. Pay attention to the effective interest rate\nMs Tan said that financial organisations often display the “lowest” rate on their websites, which is usually the applied (flat) interest rate to attract borrowers. \nBut Ms Tan suggests looking at the effective interest rate (EIR) instead, which takes into consideration the effects of compounding interest, which would be “a better gauge that reflects the true cost of borrowing”. \nFor example, a bank may say that a loan is 2 per cent interest per year. But if the interest compounds monthly, you will end up having to pay a higher interest rate than the nominal interest rate of 2 per cent.  \n3. Take note of additional fees \nBorrowers should also take note of other fee payments such as processing fees, late payment fees and early redemption fees. These are additional costs on top of the interest rate you would have to pay. \n4. Have a clear plan on how to service the loan \n“Robust financial planning is crucial before you apply for a loan,” urged Ms Tan. \n“Know how much you can repay each month and how this could affect household expenses over the long term. This will enable you to avoid the debt trap from spiralling debts that snowball over time.” \nMs Tan suggested using the \"non-mortgage debt service ratio\" as a guideline. This is a measure of your ability to pay off your debts, excluding housing debt. \nIt is calculated from dividing the total annual non-mortgage debt payment by total annual take home pay. A healthy ratio would be 15 per cent and below.\n5. Set up alerts \nThis may sound like a given, but setting up calendar reminders to avoid being late on card payments can help avoid the sting from late payment fees. Opting for Giro payments, where a fixed amount of money is transferred every month from your bank account to a billing organisation, is another option. \n“If you have more than one credit card, align the payment date on the same day for easy monitoring,” Ms Tan added. \nDespite all these tips, Ms Tan urged young people to first consider carefully if they need a loan \"as it comes at a cost\". \nIndeed, many friends I spoke to said they would only take a loan as a last resort as they are afraid of the interest rates, and that borrowing seemed \"dangerous\". \nA friend of mine added: \"I think loans create more inequality because people who are more well-off with more assets can get a higher loan, while those who are less well-off struggle to find banks that are willing to lend them money.\" \nI share the same sentiments, and foresee myself only taking a loan for an emergency or if there is no other choice.\nBut at least I am not as daunted by it now that I know what to look out for before committing to one. \nABOUT THE WRITER:\nCharlene Goh, 25, is a journalist with TODAY, covering health, sports, community and the arts."

But its many facets — from managing finances and buying a home to achieving work-life balance — can be overwhelming.\nIn this series, TODAY’s journalists help young Singaporeans navigate this stage of their lives and learn something themselves in the process.\n \nSINGAPORE — Like many Singaporeans, I discovered my hobbies and interests while participating in mandatory co-curricular activities in school or volunteering as a student.\nIn junior college, I developed an interest in theatre after drama lessons. In university, I discovered that I enjoyed teaching after taking up mentoring stints.\nI tried to pursue these interests even after entering the workforce but soon found them falling by the wayside.\nSleep, television and coffee catch-up with friends took precedence over dragging myself to a theatre performance or signing up for volunteering opportunities.\nBut it was the circuit breaker imposed last year to keep people homebound due to the coronavirus outbreak that truly exposed how dull a person I had become.\nWhile everyone spent their forced downtime baking, gardening, hiking or whipping up Dalgona coffee, I was whiling away my time on Netflix, Instagram and TikTok.\nI would spend hours after work watching several episodes of the latest shows online and then spend another hour scrolling through social media platforms before nodding off to sleep.\nMy circuit breaker experience paled in comparison to friends who excitedly shared how they had picked up yoga, adopted a pet or set up a mini garden at home.\nI rued the fact that I had squandered the chance to be more productive outside of work.\nALL WORK, NO PLAY\nCounsellors I spoke to for this piece said that it is not unusual for people to prioritise work or family over their hobbies as they get older.\nMs Clarice Ng, a counsellor with Mind What Matters, said that while the education system here provides opportunities for social interaction, such as mandatory co-curricular activities, it becomes harder to intentionally carve out time for other pursuits as an adult.\nThe pandemic also seems to have fuelled my unproductive habits.\nIn the TODAY Youth Survey conducted in early October, findings showed that the top three negative social habits young Singaporeans had picked up during the pandemic were mindless social media scrolling, TV bingeing and snacking.\nCommenting on the results, Dr Joel Yang, a clinical psychologist at Mind What Matters, had said that social media and TV provide instant gratification and stimulation for people trying to cope with the stress of the pandemic.\nMs Ng, his colleague, said: “In our world of constant stimulation, a mindless activity becomes a form of rest.”\nIT’S OKAY TO NETFLIX\nCounsellors stressed that it is “perfectly okay” to watch Netflix. However, individuals must be aware of why they are doing so.\nMs Sophia Goh, a counsellor at Sofia Wellness Clinic, said: “Are you watching Netflix because it aligns with your interests, such as a documentary about the environment that is informative… Or is it because we are just mindlessly filling up our time?\n“What makes a difference is the intention — start with being aware of your Netflix use and why you are watching Netflix.”\nMs Ng said that the same hobby could have different effects on people.\nFor example, watching a documentary on Netflix could leave someone feeling enriched and rested. On the other hand, someone who is forced to go hiking, which is usually seen as a positive activity, could end up feeling unrested instead.\nThe key, Ms Ng said, is to have hobbies that leave us feeling “nourished” and allow us to rest intentionally instead of passing time with distractions.\nMs Goh of Sofia Wellness Clinic said that to gauge if an activity adds value to you, ask yourself if an activity makes you feel excited, satisfied or feeling like you have learnt something.\nHAULING YOURSELF OFF THE ARMCHAIR\nOver the years, I have toyed with the idea of picking up new hobbies such as video editing, poetry writing or learning a new language.\nHowever, it was always less of a hassle to jump on the couch after a long day at work and leave an episode of Friends running in the background.\nOther people also told me that they have found it difficult to keep up with hobbies they enjoyed in the past.\nMs Nurul Nabila Mohamed Naseem, a 26-year-old executive assistant in the healthcare sector, said that she used to read up to 10 books a month as a student but now finds herself requiring a lot more mental effort to focus on reading after a full day of sending emails.\nHowever, Ms Nabila said that she found a replacement hobby in pole dancing instead. The physically demanding activity does not require staring at a screen and allows her to relieve stress after work.\nMs Nabila disclosed that she had been hesitant about picking it up because she did not feel confident. But she eventually mustered the motivation to sign up for classes in March after a friend suggested that they try lessons together.\nAquascaping enthusiast Lai Cam Linh, who started pursuing his hobby five years ago at the age of 34, emphasised that “it’s never too late to learn something new”.\nIt is easy to pick up something new in this day and age given the amount of information available online, the environmental engineer said.\nMr Lai, who had discovered aquascaping while buying a pet fish for his daughter, said that he picked up the hobby through YouTube tutorials and online forums.\n“Once you do your research, your success rate will be higher and the learning curve much flatter.” \nMs Goh, the counsellor, acknowledged that it might be daunting to start something new.\nIn such instances, it may help to break it down into smaller steps such as researching available classes, booking the class and buying materials.\nTo overcome the inertia of picking up a new hobby, Ms Ng of Mind What Matters said that the first step is to set a limit on unproductive activities (think Netflix bingeing) and introduce other activities in its place.\nThese replacement activities should inspire, excite or allow you to grow and learn new things.\nKEEPING COMMITTED\nTime and again, I’ve fallen off the bandwagon when trying to pick up a new hobby.\nInspired by gardener friends during the pandemic, I tried to grow my own plants and then gave up after they died before blooming.\nI also had to shelve my ambitions to be the next MasterChef Singapore after post-cooking clean-up left me more stressed than rested.\nHobbyists I spoke to shared tips on how they keep committed to their hobbies.\nMs Nabila said that while there are days where she feels too exhausted to attend a pole dancing class, she sticks to them since she has already paid for the lessons in advance.\nMs Goh, the counsellor, suggested that I set small targets to keep committed to a new hobby.\nFor instance, I could work towards playing a certain song on an instrument or running a certain distance.\nAnother way is to pay for a fixed number of classes — having something definite will give me something to look forward to, she added.  \nSTARTING SOMETHING NEW\nI haven’t given up on pursuing new hobbies altogether. For me, the biggest motivating factor has been to find pursuits that give me joy, purpose and an identity outside of my career.\nA friend of mine shared the same sentiment, saying: “I want to be able to look at my non-working hours and feel like I’m spending my short time on Earth doing more than just watching mindless television shows.”\nI have already put in place some of the tips offered by counsellors and other hobbyists for this piece.\nI started weekly rock-climbing sessions several months ago, been on a kayaking expedition and signed up for an improvisational theatre class in a bid to rediscover myself outside of work.\nTo keep myself committed, I signed up for these activities with friends and made payments in advance so that I would see through them.\nHopefully, I will have more than an analysis of the Netflix hit Squid Game to share the next time someone asks about my hobbies.\nABOUT THE WRITER:\nNavene Elangovan, 31, is a senior journalist at TODAY, covering environment, education and housing."

But its many facets — from managing finances and buying a home to achieving work-life balance — can be overwhelming.\nIn this series, TODAY’s journalists help young Singaporeans navigate this stage of their lives and learn something themselves in the process.\n \nSINGAPORE — The weekend before I returned to work from maternity leave, I decided that if I was going to juggle motherhood and my career, I was going to do it like a boss.\nI wrote myself a to-do list to complete before the big day of my return: Lay out the baby’s clothes, wash and sanitise all the breast pump parts, boot up my computer, clear my emails, buy new notebooks.\nCheck, check, all check.\nI was nervous about returning to a demanding job, but excited as well. Excited to be surrounded by adults (albeit virtually). Excited to put on proper pants. Excited to feel mentally stimulated again after months of being attached to a baby.\nAnd in my excitement, I was confident I could ace this whole full-time-working-mum gig right from the get-go.\nThat first Monday back at work, I cried twice.\nFirst, because I was so sleep-deprived that my brain could not piece two sentences together.\nThe second time because I missed my three-month-old son, Luth, and looking at photos of him made my breasts leak non-stop.\nI kept asking myself: How am I going to do this? Will it ever get easier? Will Luth be okay without me?\nIt made me realise my best-laid plans needed fine-tuning.\nIt has been three weeks so far since I got back to work, and I thought I would share what helped me manage my return, and pass on the advice I got from experts and others who have gone through this experience before.\n#1. Make sure you have a plan for the first week\nTwo weeks before my return date, I gradually left Luth at my parents’ place for short periods of time, to acclimatise all of us, as my mum would be looking after him while I worked.\nI started with a few hours here and there and gradually left him at their place for a whole day.\nStill, I struggled with separation anxiety on my first day back at work and ended up insisting that my mum only pick him up to take him back to her place after lunch.\nDo not do this on the first day of work. I repeat: Do not do this on the first day of work.\nI should have stuck to the morning routine we had practised and handed him to my parents before the work day started, so that the tears — both his and mine — would have dried and I would have been in a professional headspace by the time I sat at my work-from-home desk.\nMs Sher-li Torrey, founder of Mums@Work, a social enterprise dedicated to supporting women to find work-family balance, said that it is important for working mums to plan a schedule that allows them to return to work gradually.\nMost importantly, this schedule needs to be as flexible as possible, to give mothers some time to find their rhythm and adjust accordingly. This could mean having an option to finish early, start later, or work from home for a period while the whole family adapts to the change.\n#2. Communicate with your boss\nTwo weeks before my return, I contemplated asking my boss whether I could use the remainder of my maternity leave to take Fridays off as I eased into things.\nThis would allow me to spend more time with Luth, with whom I get to interact for just about two hours on a regular workday. I figured it would also provide my mum with some free time to attend medical appointments, take walks or meet her friends.\nBut I couldn’t quiet this nagging feeling that I was asking for too much. My other fear was that I would not be carrying enough weight on my team and others might have to pick up the slack.\nThankfully, I have a supportive manager with whom I was able to have a transparent conversation about the problems I faced.\nMs Lavinia Thanapathy, the former vice-president of the Singapore Council of Women’s Organisations, told me that even the most confident woman might feel the pangs of uncertainty as they return to work.\nIt is therefore important to have a supportive work environment and bosses.\n“A little flexibility without penalty in the first year of your child’s life can make a world of difference,” she said.\nThe experts also pointed out that after such a big life shift, it is natural to feel like you are doing less than your peers, as your post-baby self would not always have the option to tie up some loose ends on evenings or weekends.\nBut Ms Torrey reminded me that there is no need to feel guilty.\n“You can treat (your colleagues) with a gift to say 'thank you' but at the end of the day, you are part of a team. You help each other out,” she added.\n#3. Manage your expectations on what you can achieve as a working professional and a mother\nI must admit that I had too high expectations of myself before my big return.\nI envisioned my morning schedule to look like this: Wake up at 7am, give Luth a bath, feed him, wait for my parents to pick him up, clean the house, eat breakfast, then start work.\nBut by lunch time, I would be exhausted and disoriented.\nI struggled to read press releases and find the right words to use in my news reports — it was like I had forgotten how to do my job.\nI’m someone who demands high performance from myself all the time, so the best advice I got about this was to manage my expectations, especially on the first week back.\nA colleague I spoke to about this said it succinctly: “You may doubt your professional abilities after a period of absence, but believe me when I say, you know what you know.”\nAnd she was right. I could think a lot clearly when I stopped following such a rigid morning schedule and allowed myself to take naps during lunch.\nI’ve also gotten my rhythm going and am slowly regaining my confidence in my ability as a journalist.\nI even start to feel that my skill set is much stronger now than ever before — I am better at working under pressure and multitasking.\n#4. Let go of that mum guilt\nMs Torrey said that whether you are a working mum or a stay-at-home mum, it is your job to be present for your children when you can but it’s impossible to be with them round-the-clock.\nAgreeing, Ms Thanapathy said: “I deal with mum guilt by reminding myself that I am an imperfect mother raising an imperfect child. I’m not trying to do it all. I also practise being present when I am with him so that I don’t feel guilty when I am not.”\nShe said that most of what she had to let go was the weight of family and society’s expectations on working mothers.\nWhile this is something I’m still trying to navigate, I am reminding myself constantly that motherhood is not a race, and my mental health and my family’s happiness is paramount.\nAnd even with the greatest plans, sometimes stuff happens.\nYou get sick.\nThe kid gets sick.\nYou and your partner both get stuck at work.\nNo one had the time to pick up groceries so everyone is having toast for dinner.\nI have to accept that some days will not go as planned.\nAnd that’s okay.\nABOUT THE WRITER:\nNabilah Awang is a 27-year-old journalist at TODAY, where she covers community, consumer and health issues."

            "Article Body": "Adulthood is an invigorating stage of life as young people join the workforce, take on more responsibilities and set their sights on the future. But its many facets — from managing finances and buying a home to achieving work-life balance — can be overwhelming.\nIn this series, TODAY’s journalists help young Singaporeans navigate this stage of their lives and learn something themselves in the process.\n \nSINGAPORE — As I entered the working world at TODAY at age 23, I gave myself five years on the job to make a mark in one company before I would consider a career move.\nA year to learn the ropes. Two years to push my limits as I get on top of the daily grind. Another two years to ride my own wave and have some achievements to call my own.\nBy the end of the fifth year though, I felt pretty lonely being among the few fresh graduate hires within the company who were handed a long service award for staying at least five years.\nMost of my peers had left their jobs in search of greener pastures as conventional wisdom today suggests that job hopping is the straightforward guarantee to a better job title — one that no longer makes you sound like a minion — and a fatter take-home salary.\nThey sure made me feel like I was missing out, too. There would be days, especially when I was going through a particularly tough time with motivating myself, when friends would try to appeal to my better senses to leave and find another place that “values you better”.\nBut my earlier convictions kept me in check, and it was only recently — almost seven years in — that I felt that it was time to move on for the sake of personal growth.\nIn the lead-up to finally bidding goodbye on Friday (Oct 22) to this newsroom where I have been for six years and 10 months, a TODAY editor asked if I could share what I had learnt from staying on in one job for so long in an era where people tend to quit after two or three years.\nAs I thought through the lessons that I had gleaned, I also started pondering over what I had missed out by taking the approach that I did, and whether there is such a thing as “overstaying” in one job. I posed some of these questions to a few career advisers.\nHere are three things I wished I had known as a fresh graduate entering the workforce.\n#1: You will make mistakes. Don't kill yourself over them\nYear one. I came bearing romantic notions about life as an intrepid journalist and was eager to make an impression that I was worthy of chasing the “important stories”. But I ended up filling in a menial, desk-bound role as a digital reporter that was the exact opposite of what I imagined I would be doing.\nI also made many mistakes while at it and was told on a daily basis about the many aspects of my work that needed improvement.\nIn the role, I worked under a strict boss who imposed high standards even for the simplest tasks. Getting a scolding from her truly felt like the end of me and my career.\nBut I have come to realise that it was more important that I had found in her a tough mentor than to have had a boss who would go easy on me in my initial years, but from whom I would learn nothing (note: tough doesn’t mean toxic, a recent hot topic).\nIn hindsight, I would even advise my younger self to apply the startup growth hack mantra to “fail fast, fail early, and fail often” within the first six to 12 months of my career before the stakes are too high to fail further into your career.\nIn my case, it could mean embracing what that tough boss had to offer me in terms of practical tips and advice, rather than holding her at a distance to avoid illuminating all of my flaws and getting my ego stabbed any further.\nIt might help to not take the criticism too personally, or take yourself too seriously. Good bosses won’t hold your initial shortcomings against you and might even expect them. Address them with an attitude that shows a willingness to learn and adapt, and it might even reflect well on you.\nIn any case, it is definitely not worth it to let one criticism crush your dreams or lead you to think that you should quit to avoid being a liability to the team or that you would never be good enough. Take it as a chance to improve yourself.\nI gained some perspective from speaking to Ms Sandra Quelle, founder of career consultancy firm The Happy Monday Co, who said that an employer should expect to take anything between six and 18 months to get a new employee fully up to speed.\nWith that in mind, the new hire should also give themselves a similar timeframe to settle down, she said, adding that it will usually take another one or two years to have some achievements to show, and prove your worth to the company.\n#2: It will take patience to achieve your goals in an organisation \nBack to my quandary of doing ungratifying backend work while desiring to be in the thick of the action, interviewing and reporting. Even as I strove to do the work that was required of me with excellence, I was constantly worried that I would forever be relegated to those duller tasks.\nI leapt at every opportunity to head out and do some shoe-leather reporting within my role then, and eventually asked to make an internal transfer from the digital desk to the main news desk where I could do more of that.\nI was two years in as an employee then, and, to my surprise, it did not take much for the bosses to say yes. I ended up being happier and more motivated on the job, staying on till now as I found many opportunities to grow, with my personal goals and interests aligned.\nI almost did not make it to this point where I put in the request though. In what is perhaps a very Asian thought process, I felt like it might be easier to look elsewhere for a job that I might like better and leave without kicking up a fuss.\nBut Ms Quelle said leaving would be costly to both the employee and the company, and it was wise for me to be proactive about seeking out opportunities for myself, although a balance should be struck between making requests and being closed-minded or “too eager to move on”.\n“Often we want everything that I am wanting now, and that is creating a bit of an interesting dynamic in the marketplace, where companies are struggling to retain talent and on the flip side, people say, ‘I want to become a senior manager, and I don’t have time to wait’,” she said.\n“People have to understand that going to that level takes time and you have to develop the skills and it cannot be done overnight.” Today, she finds herself working with executives who rose too fast to then realise that they don’t know enough to be in that position, she added.\nThat said, those who still feel that their skills are not being utilised should at some point be honest with their bosses and vocalise what they want, Ms Quelle said. The chat can sound a lot like, “I think I can support you in this activity” or “I am very interested in going in this direction. Can you get me onto any projects where I'm getting exposure?”, she added.\nIf your goal is a financial one, Ms Quelle said that employees can keep track of their achievements within the company to remind the boss when building a case for a pay raise.\nA 3 to 5 per cent raise is the average, and she knows of people getting as much as 12 per cent in this manner, especially when the individual had gotten an expanded job scope, she said.\n“It can be painful to constantly ask for a salary raise, but it shows that you value yourself… If the initial answer is 'no', ask when you can have this conversation again. If it is six months, put a note in your calendar and ask again.”\nThis, to me, seems like an aggressive approach, but Ms Quelle begged to differ: “Expecting people to give you things or to recognise you is a little bit unrealistic. It has a higher chance if you are responsible and you voice it out.\n“Any company which has a great product, they don’t rely just on creating a great product. They go into marketing and they do it for a reason. So it is the same. You might be very good at your job, but unless you promote yourself, you will not be seen.”\n#3: Stagnation is not a good place to be in. Do something or get out \nMy best friend entered the workforce a full year before I did. And when I entered the workforce, she passed a remark that never left me: “I wake up every day feeling excited about my job. When the day comes when I no longer feel excited, I will know that that is the time to leave.”\nIt was a good rule of thumb. Indeed, there came a day when I no longer felt as engaged in my work and the days evolved to months, with me just sailing by. But instead of quitting, I found myself choosing to stay for reasons of comfort and the fear of going after something new.\nThe career consultants I spoke to all agree that there is such a thing as “overstaying” in one job, and I was showing some classic signs of that.\nLife and business coach Erlina Sidik said that, especially when people are in the early stages of their career, it is important to get as much exposure and experience as possible in order to gain clarity about their strengths, passions and, ultimately, how they contribute to the world impactfully.\n“Overstaying in a role limits one’s potential,” she said.\n Ms Sidik added that those seeking greater clarity on whether to stay or move on can ask themselves these five questions:\nAre you growing in terms of experience, knowledge and skills?\nIs your job aligned with your goals, interests and values?\nIs the role you are in leading you towards your path to success?\nDo you feel you are being fairly compensated for your contributions, or at least have the understanding and transparency of what it takes to achieve your desired compensation?\nDo you feel engaged and happy at work?\nIf the response is “no” to most of these questions, then the employee should consider if it is time to make a change as self growth and alignment are key for a fulfilling career and life, she said.\nThat said, Mr Ben So, founder of Emunah Coaching and Training, recommended that a fresh graduate stick with their first job for at least three years for their experience at the first company to mean something to the next company. “Make sure there is no more room for growth before you move, and get to know more about the next company first,” he said.\nMs Quelle said that identifying the right time to move forward is about balancing the states of being patient and being agile.\nSensing that fresh graduates here need to hear the message about being patient, more so than the importance of being agile and adaptable, she said: “When you plant a seed, you can’t expect a flower the next day. It takes time.\n“Maybe my advice to all fresh graduates is to buy a plant, and you grow at the same pace as the plant.”\nABOUT THE WRITER:\nWong Pei Ting has just finished her term as a senior journalist at TODAY, where she covered community and social affairs, education and transport issues."

            "Article Body": "Adulthood is an invigorating stage of life as young people join the workforce, take on more responsibilities and set their sights on the future. But its many facets — from managing finances and buying a home to achieving work-life balance — can be overwhelming.\nIn this series, TODAY’s journalists help young Singaporeans navigate this stage of their lives and learn something themselves in the process.\n \nSINGAPORE — As a young Singaporean, the idea of retiring with more than S$1 million in the bank before I turn 40 seems like a complete fantasy.\nThat's the aim of the Fire movement, short for “financial independence, retire early”, popular among millennials in various countries over the past decade.\nProponents say that saving hard, investing well and living frugally can deliver this financial Shangri-la.\nFor me, it's more realistic, though hardly a stroll in the park given the financial obligations of young Singaporeans, to achieve my own idyllic vision.\nI’ve long imagined myself sipping cocktails on a beach overseas a few decades down the track.\nBut even that distant goal has seemed increasingly improbable to me as obligations such as paying a mortgage dominate my bank statement.\nA chat with my friends found that they are also worried about their financial futures.\nOne said that she wanted a financially comfortable retirement to ensure, for example, that she would not be taking the bus to the hospital as a frail old person.\nAnother said that she did not want to rely on her future children for allowances like her parents do.\nOne thing we have in common is that we have had trouble kickstarting our financial planning for retirement.\nBefore I took a closer look at the issue, my own back-of-the-envelope calculations suggested that I would need about S$500,000 to retire.\nThis is assuming I retire at 65 and need an income of S$2,000 monthly for 20 years to cover basic expenses. This figure excludes the beach holidays and the medical and caregiving expenses.\nHowever, online forums suggested that I may need much more.\nA survey by Fullerton Fund Management in April this year showed that, on average, Singaporeans estimated that they would need S$1.4 million for their desired retirement.\nJust learning that I have to save so much was daunting.\nWith our retirement decades away, other friends also felt little motivation to get started.\nOne said: “How do I know what 70-year-old me will need? It’s so abstract.”\nTAKING THE FIRST STEPS\nExperts and millennials interviewed for this piece said that the motivation to plan for retirement should come from taking a look around at the signs of Singapore’s rapidly ageing population.\nMr Vincent Chan, the head of the multi-asset team at Fullerton Fund Management, cited the example of larger fonts for public housing block numbers as a prompt that could spark conversation among young people on how they intend to spend their retirement.\nThis, along with the circumstances faced by their own ageing parents and grandparents, would make the topic of retirement seem less abstract to millennials.\nThis was the case with personal finance blogger, Ms Jeraldine Phneah, who said that she started planning for her retirement after meeting unemployed people during a volunteering stint in her early 20s.\nMs Phneah, a 30-year-old technology professional, said that she encountered professionals, managers, executives and technicians in their 40s and 50s who had lost their jobs and were struggling to support their older parents and young children.\nShe said: “My experiences made me insecure and fearful about our generation’s future. Can we retire or will we be trapped in this rat race forever?”\nHOW MUCH IS ENOUGH?\nIt seems that I am not the only one who has been off the mark with estimates for their retirement savings.\nA survey by OCBC bank’s Financial Wellness Index last year found that close to 80 per cent of Singaporeans underestimated the retirement amount they needed based on their ideal retirement lifestyle.\nThe age group that underestimated the most — by 40 per cent — was millennials.\nMy interviewees said that to kickstart my retirement planning, I would have to get a more accurate estimate of how much I would need.\nMr Chan of Fullerton said that having firmed up a target figure, individuals can then estimate how much they would need to save yearly or monthly to reach their financial goal.\nProviding an example, Mr Chan cited a recent study published by the Nanyang Technological University and National University of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy last week that suggested that a retiree needs a minimum of S$1,421 monthly for expenses.\nAfter adjusting for inflation and assuming an individual needs to be supported for 25 years of retirement, this translates into savings of S$852,600 by the age of 60, Mr Chan said.\nThis means setting aside S$32,792 yearly or S$2,732 a month from the age of 24.\nMr Chan acknowledged that many young Singaporeans may not be able to set aside such amounts and suggested they start off with a regular savings or investment plan to accumulate savings. Over time, their savings will benefit from compounding over a longer period of time.\nHOW DO I REACH MY GOALS?\n1. Set targets\nFellow millennials I spoke to also said that setting financial targets at different stages of my life will make my retirement goals seem more achievable.\nMr Yeap Ming Feng, 31, head of marketing at personal finance community Seedly, said that he had set such targets for himself, too, even if they’re not quite as ambitious as those in the Fire movement.\nHis first milestone, which he set and achieved last year, was to have a diversified investment portfolio of up to S$80,000 with exposure into different markets by the age of 30.\nHe also plans to have at least S$500,000 in funds at the age of 40 and close to S$1 million before he turns 45.\nSome targets may seem bold, but Mr Yeap said it also ensures that individuals still have adequate finances if they fall short of their targets.\n2. Contribute to CPF\nThe most fuss-free way to start saving, Mr Chan said, is to regularly top up my Central Provident Fund (CPF) account to earn higher returns rather than leave my excess savings in the bank.\nThe Special Account in CPF, for instance, has an interest rate of 4 per cent. This offers far better returns than banks, with prevailing interest rates on savings accounts well below 2 per cent.\nCPF offers other options as well, such as using funds from a member’s Ordinary Account or Special Account to invest in the CPF Investment Scheme.\n3. Invest\nHowever, doing so may mean a person’s CPF monies will be sufficient only to address basic requirements. A recent survey showed that monthly payouts from the CPF basic retirement sum will be enough to just meet spending needs of around S$1,400, Mr Chan said.\nFor a more comfortable retirement, he said that individuals will need to invest in growth assets to accumulate higher retirement savings.\nMr Yeap said that investments should beat inflation rates so that an individual’s purchasing power remains the same in future.\nHe also recommended having some liquid investment products or investing funds in Government-backed Singapore Savings Bonds.\nSuch investments can be cashed in quickly if you are in need of emergency funds even before retirement, he added.\n4. Get adequate insurance coverage\nAt the same time, millennials should also have basic insurance coverage such as hospitalisation plans in place to cover sudden expenses, said Mr Yeap.\nSharing his personal experience, Mr Yeap said that he would have been “living under a bridge now” if his late mother, who died of cancer several years ago, was not adequately covered for her medical and hospitalisation bills.\n5. Get more pay\nMs Phneah said that she focused on increasing her earning power, given that there was a limit to how much she could save.\nShe built skills that were in demand for her job, stayed abreast of industry trends and networked to maximise the income from her career.\nFor the first five years of working full time from the age of 23, she was able to more than triple her annual income.\nJUGGLING MULTIPLE FINANCIAL GOALS\nSeveral times, I have found myself setting aside plans for my retirement savings to focus on more immediate financial goals such as purchasing a house or supporting my parents in their old age.\nIs it even tenable for a young Singaporean to start preparing for retirement so early when we have multiple financial goals to juggle?\nMr Yeap says that the concerns I raise were a symptom of the “sandwiched generation” of millennials.\nNot only do millennials have to manage their own financial security, but they also have to financially support both their parents and their children. As a result, the retirement adequacy of one generation has a knock-on effect on the next.\nAs such, it is important to communicate with ageing parents on their retirement finances. This would help young Singaporeans figure out how to support their aged parents while saving for their own retirement, said Mr Yeap.\nMr Chan acknowledged that millennials face competing demands on limited savings. However, these demands have different target dates for when funds are required.\nFor example, a full home mortgage payment can take up to 30 years while an overseas education plan for one’s children could take 18 years.\nTo this end, it is important to have good financial planning to balance one’s priorities with their available resources, said Mr Chan.\nElaborating, Mr Chan said that a good financial plan will list all financial goals, as well as the amount and time required to meet them.\nIt should also state one’s financial resources, such as salaries, CPF savings, investment income and expected returns.\nRESTARTING RETIREMENT PLANS\nHaving received advice from my interviewees, achieving S$1 million in savings seems a little less daunting though I certainly don’t expect to do so during my 30s.\nI am ready to take another crack at planning for my retirement. I will hold off on my retirement beach plans for now.\nABOUT THE WRITER:\nNavene Elangovan, 31, is a senior journalist at TODAY, covering environment and education.\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this article stated that Ms Jeraldine Phneah started working full time from age 25.

            "Article Body": "Adulthood is an invigorating stage of life as young people join the workforce, take on more responsibilities and set their sights on the future. But its many facets — from managing finances and buying a home to achieving work-life balance — can be overwhelming.\nIn this series, TODAY’s journalists help young Singaporeans navigate this stage of their lives and learn something themselves in the process.\n \nSINGAPORE — Like many others in this inexplicable pandemic housing boom, I stepped into a barren and unfurnished flat for the first time last week, only to be awash with conflicting feelings of excitement and dread.\nHave you heard of pineapple-rolling?\nThis uniquely Singaporean custom dictates that when moving into a new place, it is auspicious to roll a pineapple into the home with both hands, while exclaiming — possibly to the chagrin of one’s new neighbours — the auspicious phrase “huat, ah!”, which means to prosper.\nThe spot where the pineapple stops is where all the good luck is, apparently.\nMy family isn’t superstitious, but maybe we should have been.\nThat’s because our first new-flat experience was to recoil at the number of lizards scurrying away on our arrival to hide in crevices and behind peeling paint, as well as at the tacky cupboards that the previous owners left behind.\nOh boy, this place needed some serious renovation work.\nIt is my family’s newly purchased resale home, and the previous owners had handed over the keys to the flat on the contractual due date of Oct 1 — half a year after we signed the sales agreement.\nYou can imagine our delirium in the lead-up to this major household event.\nThere was the sheer number of consequential decisions that needed to be made and things that had to be done: Which mover, renovator or contractor should we hire? What’s the budget? Where will all my stuff go?\nMoving from one home to another is an intensely emotional process because it is disruptive to our sense of familiarity.\nYet it can also be positively symbolic — a much-needed change of environment and a fresh start.\nA change in one’s residence is on a list of major stressful life events drawn up in 1967 by psychiatrists Thomas Holmes and Richard Rahe. A 2017 longitudinal study on children by British social scientists also found an association between house-moving and the development of behavioural difficulties later in life.\nIt is no surprise that a poll of 1,000 Americans last year concluded that moving house was more nerve-racking than having children or starting a new job.\nThen there is the Covid-19 pandemic. TODAY reported last month about delays and rising construction costs due to a shortage of migrant workers as well as higher raw material costs.\nIn the first half of this year, Singapore’s consumer watchdog reported a near doubling of complaints against renovation contractors to 621, from 312 in the same period last year.\nAlmost half (48 per cent) of the complaints were from people unhappy with the quality of renovation services rendered, the Consumers Association of Singapore said. And around a third of the complaints were against renovation contractors who failed to complete the renovation projects on time or according to agreed project milestones.\nMr Jon Ho, co-founder of renovation platform Homeez, said that homeowners have plenty of worries and concerns about the renovation process because the industry generally lacks transparency.\n“They have to make a decision on which firm to hire based on initial impressions and the quotation by the interior designer that, more often than not, comes with hidden costs, which can lead to many misunderstandings and unhappiness.”\nInto this opaque and fraught territory of life-changing decisions I went.\nFearing for my sanity and armed with this Adulting 101 assignment, I reached out to the pros to help me navigate the potential pitfalls.\nFIRST STEPS\nThe first steps in this process, as I’ve been told, happen way before one sets foot in one’s new home.\nIdeally, one should begin looking for a contractor or an interior designer two to six months before key collection, Mr Ho said. That is, if one’s intention is to move in as soon as possible.\nMs Madeline Chen, head of marketing at home improvement platform Qanvast, recommends speaking to three to five designers at a minimum.\n“We recommend speaking to this many designers to get a sense of the quotation based on your design requirements. They may be able to advise some ways to keep within your budget,” she said.\nWindow-shopping as early as six months before key collection buys you time to make key decisions on how your home will look and which firm can carry out that vision.\nMs Chen said that homeowners generally shortlist their preferred firms based on user reviews and the companies’ design portfolio, but there are human factors other than what is on their marketing materials to consider as well.\nFor example, many homeowners Qanvast spoke to said “chemistry” was key.\nThe designer should be able to understand what you’re looking for in a home and must be someone whom you aren’t afraid to approach with questions.\nCommunication and trust are key to a smooth process, Ms Chen said. “Finding a renovation partner is like finding a life partner.”\nIn general, there are two options for the homeowner at this point — hiring an interior designer who can manage the project for you or, if you prefer a more hands-on approach to building your home, going with contractors. \nThe second option can be more cost-effective, though miscommunication can happen.\n“Their interpretation of a ‘Scandinavian-themed’ home could be different from what you envision it to be,” Ms Chen said.\nEven so, for smaller-scale and less complicated renovation projects, it may be more ideal to hire a contractor who will liaise with sub-contractors and suppliers to find the best rates.\nUltimately, which route is better will depend on your renovation budget as well as the scale of the work that you have in mind.\nHence, start looking and getting quotations early.\nMr Vincent Goi, design director at interior design firm Arkhilite, said that the recommended cut-off time to appoint a designer is two to three months before the expected date of key collection.\n“Good design takes some time. For an apartment, it can take two to three months for the design firm to create a design concept, discuss it with the client, do up the drawings and confirm the documentation with the client,” he said.\n“Many new homeowners appoint their design firm too late.”\nBUDGETING\nGood design will also cost you, and deciding how much to spend on the computer-generated interior design plans by designers and contractors can be a mind-boggling affair.\nFor renovations of resale flats, Ms Chen suggested setting a higher budget to factor in the cost of any teardowns and repairs, which can add up.\nWith renovation of a government-built flat costing anywhere between S$18,000 and S$120,000, depending on the extent of work needed and excluding furnishing and appliances, she also recommends putting aside another 10 to 20 per cent of the budget for any “top-ups” along the way.\nAfter all, Mr Goi from Arkhilite said, two wardrobes of the same dimensions may not cost the same if the homeowner picks a different material or detail.\nMr Ravindran Shanmugam, regional head for Southeast Asia at design firm Livspace Singapore, said that most people spend between 8 and 12 per cent of the value of a house on interiors.\nThis is a good rule of thumb.\n“However, there is no ‘right’ budget,” he added. “The interior designer’s responsibility is to ensure you can get your dream home for the amount you’re comfortable spending.”\nHe, too, warns about hidden costs — an unfortunate side-effect of the renovation industry’s general lack of transparency.\nThe prices of furniture and products, design and management fees, service charges, delivery and installation costs as well as taxes can lead to \"bill shock\".\n“Many interior designers and contractors don't give customers complete transparency in their quotations, and costs can spiral. Transparent pricing is vital,” Mr Ravindran said, adding that his firm is among those that stick to its upfront prices.\nPREPARING FOR PITFALLS\nThen there are the deliverables: Will the final product be up to mark? Are the floor tiles what I picked? Will the wardrobes fall apart after a while?\n“After spending a bomb on designing, homeowners look for quality interiors that last a lifetime. However, in many cases, quality is mediocre, with the finishes superficially attractive but unlikely to last over one to two years,” Mr Ravindran said.\nProject delays are another troubling development, made more acute by the pandemic.\nExperts told me that labour woes and material supply shortages were causing delays of at least a month.\nWhile there is a lot of anticipation and excitement about moving into a new home, Mr Ravindran said that delays owing to unrealistic or false commitments can cause immense frustration.\nMs Chen said: “It’s rare that a renovation will be 100 per cent smooth-sailing.\n“Go in with the expectation that there may be a few hiccups, such as material or manpower shortages, or unforeseen site constraints like building restrictions, that may require you to change your plans.”\nFortunately, finding inspiration, visualising designs, getting quotations and searching for the right contacts can all be done on a rising number of “omni-channel” platforms that try to become one-stop shops bringing together designers, contractors and suppliers, while pledging quality at good prices.\nThese are platforms and design firms that have also adopted technology to smoothen the process.\nGone are the days when homeowners had to trawl furniture malls and peruse hundreds of barely navigable “designer” websites.\nIf you’re like me and belong to a part of the internet generation who decides what to eat or buy based on online reviews, some of these tools can come in handy.\nHomeez, which is powered by artificial intelligence, allows users to create three-dimensional interior designs and receive quotations based on these plans. It also has a dashboard to manage renovation projects.\nQanvast’s listings feature interior designers, renovation contractors and architects. Its website also has a budget calculator to help set budgets based on past data from more than S$20 million worth of renovation contracts.\nTo quote former United States president Dwight Eisenhower, who commanded the Allied forces in World War II: “In preparing for battle, I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable.”\nRenovation and house-moving can be a frustrating process even after you have sorted out the details.\nEverything goes according to plan until Murphy’s law kicks in.\nWhen hiccups happen, as they inevitably do in complex projects during a pandemic, remember to not be too hard on yourself.\nSometimes, it’s just bad luck. Perhaps that is where the pineapple-rolling might help.\nABOUT THE WRITER:\nNg Jun Sen is a correspondent at TODAY whose interests include economics, property, politics and technology."

But its many facets — from managing finances and buying a home to achieving work-life balance — can be overwhelming.\nIn this series, TODAY’s journalists help young Singaporeans navigate this stage of their lives and learn something themselves in the process.\n \nSINGAPORE — Not too long ago, a colleague asked me: “Why aren’t you green?”\nFor context, we were chatting about a recent Big Read I wrote for TODAY on ethical consumerism in Singapore, and how some of my interviewees were trying their best to live both sustainably and ethically.\nIn the report, I also quoted a Climate Index published by OCBC bank and digital media company Eco-Business, which found that of the 2,000 Singaporean respondents they polled, 80 per cent listed “sustainable living” as the most important element under Singapore’s Green Plan.\nYet, despite scoring a high of 8.3 out of 10 for sustainability awareness — that is, they were well-informed on environmental issues — the index found that the respondents were half-hearted when it came to adopting green practices and advocating them.\n“That’s you, lah,” my colleague said. I countered that I refuse to take straws when buying drinks from the coffee shops, and I stuff most of my purchases into my backpack when I need to shop, rather than use a plastic bag.\nThankfully, our conversation was over text message, and she did not see me sheepishly turning off the air-conditioner for my bedroom-cum-office that, as usual, was on a fairly chilly setting, with the fan on at full blast as well. I like it cold.\nShe was right. As someone who has covered environmental topics from time to time, I have not been doing my best to live sustainably.\nI admit, I have always put my own convenience and comfort first. It has felt like too much of a hassle to change my lifestyle.\nBut what about my peers? What was stopping them from living sustainably?\nAn informal poll I did with them found that the most common reason they gave was the perception that it is expensive to adopt a sustainable way of living.\nYet, those who have already made living sustainably as part of their identity disagreed that it was a hassle or expensive to do so.\nFor this column, I returned to one of my interviewees for The Big Read feature and also spoke with a sustainability advocate to get some practical and achievable tips to inspire those who, like me, would like to make a meaningful change in their lifestyle for the betterment of the environment.\nAs for those who are more concerned about their wallets than the environment, some of these tips might still be useful since they encourage you to be careful with your money.\nWHAT DOES IT MEAN TO LIVE SUSTAINABLY?\nLiving sustainably does not mean having to buy eco-friendly products, which can be rather expensive.\nMs Jasmine Hussain said that \"it is completely unnecessary”. She was the 25-year-old interviewee for The Big Read, who set herself down the path of trying to live sustainably at the age of 19 and has kept on it consistently.\n“It’s about not living excessively, and being conscious about your purchases and whether you really need it. It’s as simple as that.”\nIn other words, it is about minimising the need to use more resources than we have to.\nMs Samantha Thian, a sustainability manager and founder of Seastainable, a social business that supports marine conservation, expressed a similar view.\nThe 27-year-old added that it is also about finding ways to cut down on your carbon footprint.\nTHE ‘BUYERARCHY OF NEEDS’\nMs Thian said that when it comes to making purchases, it will be helpful to think in terms of the “Buyerarchy of Needs”.\nCreated by Canadian illustrator Sarah Lazarovic, it is a hierarchy of behaviour that is inspired by Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, a psychological theory of human motivation.\nMs Lazarovic treats buying as the top tier of the pyramid — the last resort — after all other options for obtaining the items you need have been tried.\nI have categorised the tips shared by Ms Thian and Ms Hussain according to the “Buyerarchy”, starting from the bottom tier of the pyramid.\n1. Use what you have\nRather than buy fancy, eco-friendly products such as tumblers, bamboo straws or lunch boxes, why not consider if you really need them, they said.\nIf you do, search your home first as you might already have similar items that could do the job, Ms Hussain said.\nFor example, if you need to organise your room, you might already have empty shoe boxes that you could use for storage, rather than buying a brand new container.\n“It’s good to know what you have already because we tend to have a lot of things at home that we don’t realise are useful and functional,” she said.\n2. Borrow or swap\nIf you cannot find what you need at home, the next thing you could do is ask your friends or family.\n“Parents like to have multiples of things that they don’t really need,” she quipped. “And a lot of people get freebies, too, so I’m sure they may have extra things lying around that you could use.”\nAnd in some instances, you might be able to trade the desired item for something the other person needs that you might have as well.\n3. Thrift\nIf borrowing or swapping fails, then you can always consider heading to the thrift stores or online classified platforms such as Carousell for pre-loved items such as clothes or electronics.\nMore than once, I have also heard accounts from friends that they have encountered sellers on Carousell letting go of items that are almost brand new due to purchasing mistakes on the seller’s end.\nSo why not help them out while scoring yourself a deal?\nAnd when none of the above does it for you, only then do you need to consider buying something new.\nLOWERING CARBON FOOTPRINT\nAside from being conscious of our buying habits, we could also find other ways to live sustainably, Ms Thian said.\nFor meat-lovers hoping to lower their carbon footprint, Ms Thian suggested going meat-free once a week, rather than going completely vegetarian. “This is really achievable,” she said.\nMs Thian suggested other achievable ideas to consider to reduce carbon output or resource consumption:\nCycling to nearby locations, rather than driving or being driven there\nLimiting the use of the air-conditioner\nCollecting rainwater for your plants\nAdding water thimbles to your taps to save water\nAnd if you are doing food takeaways, it is good to plan ahead so you will always have a reusable container on hand when you need it.\nCHANGING HABITS\nAs I thought about the feasibility of implementing these ideas for myself, Ms Hussain told me that I should take it at my own pace and “don’t feel guilty” if I cannot stick to it.\nShe said that for someone hoping to embark on their own sustainability journey, the one mistake to make is to commit to a radical change all at once.\nThis approach is simply not, pardon the pun, sustainable and you will likely be overwhelmed and put off by it.\nA friend recommended author James Clear’s book Atomic Habits: Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results as a source of inspiration for forming new habits.\nMr Clear states that one of the laws for doing so is to make it as easy for yourself as possible.\nSo pick what you feel is doable and keep at it. Over time, it will become automatic and you will eventually form a new habit.\nAs Mr Clear puts it, every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.\n“No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity. This is one reason why meaningful change does not require radical change. Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity,” he wrote.\nABOUT THE WRITER:\nLow Youjin is a senior journalist at TODAY where he covers the environment, manpower, as well as the court and crime beats."

But its many facets — from managing finances and buying a home to achieving work-life balance — can be overwhelming.\nIn this series, TODAY’s journalists help young Singaporeans navigate this stage of their lives and learn something themselves in the process.\n \nSINGAPORE — Before I started working, I never really had to plan how I wanted to spend my free time. My friends and I always decided on the spur of the moment to hang out, and we would.  \nWhen I was living on campus in university, all I needed was a knock on my door and in 10 minutes, I would be ready to head out for drinks or to our favourite late-night supper places.\nThat all changed once I started a full-time job. \nI could no longer spontaneously say \"yes\" to friends on weeknights and indulge in late-night suppers, because I was so exhausted from work.\nMy friends and I tried scheduling to meet for dinners a few times as well, but it never worked out because someone would inevitably have to work overtime.\nAnd when the weekend arrived, I started rejecting friends who did ask to meet, because I wanted to recharge before the next work week started.\nAnd so gradually, I found myself sinking into a weekend routine of waking up late and staying home to nap, read and watch shows.\nAfter all, based on aspirational messages I had seen on on social media, that is what #selfcare is about. The only things lacking in my routine were bubble baths and scented candles.\nIf you simply go by what Instagram says, self-care is all about focusing on yourself, spending time alone and indulging whatever impulses you may have.\nDon’t want to travel for lunch? Order in — that’s self-care. Want to get a new pair of shoes? Treat yourself, self-care. Don’t want to reply to your friends’ texts? They should understand, you’re just practising self-care. \nBut the thing is, I soon realised after several months that my weekend “self-care” routine was not making me feel better. \nAt the end of each weekend, I would feel empty, not recharged. I started to miss my friends and the good times we had. \nSELF-CARE IS DIFFERENT FOR EVERYONE\nWhen I spoke to counsellors for this column, I learnt that my understanding of self-care was somewhat off. Who knew social media might not be the best place to get free therapy?\nMr Praveen Nair, a psychologist at Raven Counselling and Consultancy, said that people need to be careful when consuming online advice about self-care.\n“If you google the term ‘self-care’, you will find a generic pool of information out there,” he said.\nHowever, what self-care means is going to be different for everyone. \nFurthermore, self-care is not just about indulging every whim that strikes you. Ms Sophia Goh, the principal counsellor of Sofia Wellness Clinic, said that it is about tending to your physical, intellectual, emotional and spiritual needs.\n“Exercising can be a form of self-care. Saying ‘no’ to someone who you don’t feel is a good friend can be a form of self-care.”\nMr Nair noted that the advice he has given to clients seeking help in managing stress or fatigue really depends on their individual circumstances. For example, some clients need to learn how to identify and substitute negative thinking patterns. Others require more action-oriented activities such as high-intensity workouts to destress.\nIt turns out self-care is quite a serious matter. Mr Nair said that knowing when to take time out to take care of your body is important. While feeling fatigued from work is common in Singapore, ignoring the tiredness and letting it build up could eventually affect your day-to-day functioning.\nThe common signs include: \n\nPerennial low moods\nHaving negative feelings or having constant mood swings\nDisinterest in the things you used to enjoy \nFeeling physically tired\nHeadaches\nUlcers\nFalling sick more often\nHOW TO SELF-CARE LIKE A PRO\nStripped to its core, self-care is really just as the name suggests — taking care of yourself. \nFor it to be effective, properly taking care of yourself must begin with an awareness of what’s happening to your body and what your body needs.\nThat involves having a firm grasp of how you are spending your time every day and planning ahead, Mr Nair said.\nSimply doing things that you want to do at each moment is not always the right approach to tackling exhaustion or improving your mood. \nMs Goh agreed that planning is key — working on your mental and emotional well-being involves making intentional and deliberate decisions.\nShe suggests thinking back to the last few times when you felt good, and then figure out what were the factors that contributed to that feeling, rather than latching on to whatever self-care practice is trending.\n“Maybe it’s knocking off work strictly at 6pm? Or is it that your weekends are well-protected? Or is it when you spend one hour outdoors in the morning before work?”\nMr Nair sees self-care as a consistent practice to incorporate in our day-to-day lives, rather than an act of recharging every time you hit a plateau.\nSure, it may soothe you in that moment, but really what that does is delay your burnout to a later date, he cautioned. \nAfter learning all this, I’ve come to realise that for me, self-care may involve committing to more social interactions instead of resting at home.\nNo judgement against those who truly find pleasure in staying home and being alone — it’s just not the right strategy for me.\nLooking back, the times when I have felt the most fulfilled were moments when I was spending quality time with my friends and loved ones.\nThe challenge is making plans and pulling myself out of bed.\nWhen I spoke to my editor about this column, she prescribed a simple solution: All I need to do is send out mass text messages to my friends to ask whether they want to hang out, and then schedule these meetups in my calendar as they come in.\nCounter-intuitive as it may sound, caring for myself and finding real pleasure takes effort and planning — but I guess that’s just adulting.  \nABOUT THE WRITER:\nDaryl Choo is a journalist at TODAY, where he covers transport, defence, manpower, and crime and court."

            "Article Body": "Adulthood is an invigorating stage of life as young people join the workforce, take on more responsibilities and set their sights on the future. But its many facets — from managing finances and buying a home to achieving work-life balance — can be overwhelming.\nIn this series, TODAY’s journalists help young Singaporeans navigate this stage of their lives and learn something themselves in the process.\n \nSINGAPORE — Ranting about toxic personalities seems to be more common these days, especially among people who are around my age.\nMeetups with friends often revolve around them talking about their difficult relationships with other people in their family of social circles.\nAlthough complaints about bosses or colleagues are pretty much universal, I have noticed that we tend to be more vulnerable when we ruminate about our loved ones such as our parents and partners.\nConversations about childhood trauma and how that has led us to develop certain anxieties are often just waiting to be picked up for more psychoanalysis.\nAnd it’s an issue that seems to be increasingly addressed among mental health advocates.\nWhile scrolling through social media, it’s not unusual to see a mental health page or a therapist I follow posting about the importance of setting health boundaries, especially with people who don’t seem to respect them.\nAnd I think that has somewhat helped my friends and I gain some level of knowledge of what behaviours are toxic and unacceptable.\nA friend of mine shared with me that her relationship with her mother has always been difficult since she was a kid.\nWhenever they argued, her mother would scream and cry and tell her that my friend doesn’t love her — a form of emotional manipulation that she didn’t understand at that time.\nShe used to think that her mother was just someone who is demanding and not very easy-going.\nBut it was only after reading up online resources and going through therapy — coupled with some physical distance as she went to university overseas — that she realised how unhealthy and toxic the relationship was.\nDespite greater knowledge of such issues, I still feel that recognising toxicity is not something deeply ingrained and intuitive, where we are able to make an accurate assessment of someone causing distress in our lives.\nMore often than not, through our conversations, I find that my friends and I still end up constantly questioning and second-guessing ourselves.\nSo, how do we go about recognising what is toxic behaviour and what is not? It’s easy to identify someone is outright mean and unkind, but counsellors say toxic behaviours can often be masked.\nMs Vinti Mittal, clinical director at SACAC Counselling, said that people with toxic qualities can even be quite the charmer at first.\nSome toxic traits that may be harder to spot include:\nManipulating you into doing what you do not want to do or that goes against your values\nBeing unable to take responsibility for their feelings or behaviours\nBeing quick to find fault and push blame without wanting to listen\nBeing self-absorbed such that conversations revolved around themselves\nConstantly complaining\nConstantly comparing you with others\nGaslighting (controlling someone by making them believe things that are not true, for example)\nControlling\nDr John Lim, chief wellbeing officer at the Singapore Counselling Centre, said that toxic relationships are ultimately about one person taking far more than they give, unlike healthy relationships that are centred around a balance of give and take. \n“After an interaction with someone leaves you with negative emotions, reflecting on your thought patterns and actions allows you to evaluate if you are acting of your own will or influenced by another factor. Our emotions are often good indicators when it comes to picking out toxic people,” he added.\nMs Mittal also provided me with a rather helpful checklist that I could use to assess whether a person has been displaying toxic behaviours.\nAre they being judgemental of you or others that are close to you?\nAre they highly demanding in terms of your time and energy?\nAre they individuals who lack financial, professional, physical and emotional stability in their lives?\nAre you being shamed?\nAre you being blamed when things or situations go wrong?\nAre you isolating yourself from others and not engaging in activities or people you enjoyed being with?\nAll these actions can cause a person to constantly doubt themselves, question their self-worth and what they believe in, and be self-critical and feel lousy about themselves.\n“(People with toxic traits) bring with them a feeling of bringing you down rather than uplifting your spirits and moods,” Ms Mittal said.\nThese negative emotions are not something unfamiliar to me or to some of my friends.\nLooking back, the amount of times we talked about how certain individuals made us “go crazy” was testament to this.\nNonetheless, Dr Lim pointed out that it is important to separate people from their behaviours.\n“We are all guilty of toxic behavioural patterns from time to time, but the difference lies in how we respond to those who point those things out to us,” he said.\nOf course, pointing these things out and learning to manage the unhealthy traits is the logical next step.\nCounsellors I spoke to suggested several methods.\nDirectly addressing the behaviour by communicating to them candidly and factually. “Being firm conveys the message that you do not stand for their toxic behaviour, while at the same time bringing the behaviour to their awareness so that they have a chance to change for the better,” Dr Lim said.\nDrawing concrete boundaries by reducing interactions with them whenever possible, and setting realistic expectations of what you will and will not accept from them.\nRecognise your own self-worth and value by speaking to people who respect your individuality and views.\nPractising self-compassion and accepting who you are and what you want, and accepting who they are and what they want in their lives.\nOf course, the last resort would be to cut these people out of our lives if the toxicity persists, though counsellors recognise that this is much easier said than done.\n“As a general guide, it might be time to walk away when the person’s toxic behaviours are taking a heavy toll on your mental or physical well-being, or both,” Dr Lim said.\n“While this step might be the hardest, over time, you might come to thank yourself for making this difficult decision as you surround yourself with other more supportive and healthy relationships,” he added.\nHowever, cutting toxic people out of our lives seems impossible, when these people happen to be our family members.\nI do know of some friends who have decided to have nothing to do with their siblings.\nAnother person I know has decided to leave Singapore and move overseas for the specific purpose of creating distance between him and his parents.\nBut many, I would think, are straddling the in-between zones of learning to maintain their sanity without totally severing ties.\nDr Lim said one option that could be worth considering is to temporarily remove oneself from the relationship, rather than completely severing ties, if multiple attempts have been made to address a person’s toxic behaviours.\n“Doing so can give both you and the toxic family member the space to set the stage for mutual respect, as well as to reflect on what has happened.” \nUltimately, whether the relationship can be salvaged depends on both parties.\nUnless the person displaying toxic behaviours realises that something is wrong and sees the need for change, what most of us can do is only to regulate our own behaviour since we can’t control others, Ms Mittal said.\n“Normally, human beings change their behaviour only if there are consequences,” she added.\nWhile my friend has learned several techniques through therapy to prevent conflicts with her mother from escalating, it has served to defuse only some degree of tension.\nAt the core of it, the relationship between mother and daughter has not improved.\n“I think I have to accept she won't change,” she said.\nUnfortunately, I feel that that is also the case for the toxic people I deal with in my own life, and probably those of my friends as well.\nWe just have to learn to manage them in ways that are least damaging to our own mental health.\nABOUT THE WRITER:\nJanice Lim is a senior journalist at TODAY, where she covers business, housing and consumer issues."

But its many facets — from managing finances and buying a home to achieving work-life balance — can be overwhelming.\nIn this series, TODAY’s journalists help young Singaporeans navigate this stage of their lives and learn something themselves in the process.\n \nSINGAPORE — After I started my first full-time job in 2019, there was one common refrain echoed by all of my friends when we met for meals to catch up: “I cannot wait to move out.”\nWith a taste of financial freedom came a desire for more independence. But there were also other push-factors they mentioned for wanting to fly out of the coop.\nOne friend was feeling frustrated over still being treated like a kid by her parents who continued to impose curfews on their adult child even as she entered her mid-20s.\nAt one point, the idea of installing a GPS tracking app to know her whereabouts was floated by her parents, to much consternation.\nAnother friend bemoaned losing her privacy after having to shift back into a room shared with her siblings.\nShe had gotten used to enjoying the luxuries of having a dormitory room all to herself while she was in university.\nThen there are the usual squabbles about cleanliness and mess. This friend said: “My mum is both a hygiene and neat freak, so it’s very difficult.”\nSome of these frustrations came to a head during the circuit-breaker period last year, when the partial lockdown meant having to be at home with family members at all hours of the day, resulting in more clashes.\nFor my part, I, too, sympathised with some of the pains of navigating living with parents as an adult.\nHaving lived abroad for four years while I was at university, I got used to having my own routines and habits without needing to consult or keep anyone in the loop.\nMoving back to Singapore in 2019, there was a “reverse culture shock” of suddenly being back under my parents’ roof again and re-adjusting to their habits and rules.\nNow, before parents pull out their pitchforks, don’t get me wrong — I am endlessly appreciative of having a place where I can live rent-free with most of the bills and daily necessities taken care of by my parents.\nMy friends say the same as well — that while they yearn for their own freedom and to chart their own paths as adults, they love their parents and are grateful for their care and support.\nBut tensions are inevitable as children form their own preferences and desires in adulthood and parents come to the realisation that their children have grown up, and have to learn to let go.\nLEARNING TO LET GO\nTo write this column, I wanted to give parents a chance to air their perspectives, so I spoke to a friend’s mum who has learned the art of letting go and reaching a compromise.\nThis friend has gotten into disagreements with her mum in the past, but they have always managed to come to a compromise, or if not, at least an understanding, after talking things out.\nWhen I asked her mum how she manages her relationships with her three adult children, she said that she made a note to herself to let go and not interfere too much in their lives once they enter university.\nFor example, if they wish to have parties and have friends over, she has no problems so long as they seek permission first.\nThat being said, for issues that are of concern to her, she would still want to make her feelings known to her kids.\nFor instance, she would not feel comfortable if her daughter wanted to stay over at her boyfriend’s place.\nBut ultimately, if her daughter still decides to do so after she has said her piece, she would learn to accept it.\nAfter all, it would be worse if the issue caused a strife in their relationship and her daughter stopped confiding in her as a result.\n“(If her decision does not turn out well) at least she can still come back to me. If, let’s say, I were to burn all bridges, then after that, where is she going to turn to?\n“The connection (between parent and child) must still be there. If she has nowhere to go then it’ll just be worse,” she reasoned.\nCOMMUNICATION IS KEY\nThe level of understanding between my friend and her mum, while admirable, may not be easy to achieve, so I spoke to two counsellors for advice on how young adults can better manage their relationships with their parents as they seek to gain more control over their lives in adulthood.\nBoth of them said that though it will definitely be challenging, good and clear communication of your needs and wants is key to managing expectations between both parties.\nMs Clarice Ng, a counsellor at MindWhatMatters clinic who works mainly with youth and young adults, said that it also helps to be assertive and specific about what you want from your parents.\nFor example, instead of telling your parents to stop doing something you don’t like, you should let them know what you would like to see them do instead.\n“When you keep repeating that you don’t want (your parents to do something), your parents don’t know what you want them to do because to them, this is the only way they know how to show their concern,” she said.\nMs Theresa Pong, counselling director at The Relationship Room, said that it could be helpful for young adults to try to see things from their parents’ perspective — listen to what their concerns really are and try to provide reassurance that their fears are unfounded.\nFor instance, if the conflict is over staying out late at night, Ms Pong said that you can provide your parents more frequent updates on when you are going home or let them know the time you will be heading back and stick to it.\n“This is a period where you’re trying to build trust and assurance with them. Once that trust is built, they will be assured that you know how to manage this newfound freedom. Then, slowly over time, they will let go,” she said.\nThat being said, both counsellors acknowledged that changes will not happen overnight and many conversations on the same topic may need to take place before both parties come to a compromise.\nStill, they agreed that talking things out is better than ignoring or avoiding the issue or your parents altogether, because doing so will make the situation and relationship worse.\nFor parents, Ms Ng said they should try to understand that it is a natural part of a young adult’s development to want to try and establish themselves as individuals.\nIt would also be helpful for parents to realise that the way they are communicating their needs may be pushing their children away instead of coming to a consensus.\nFor example, making statements like, “You don’t want me anymore is it?” or “You’re being so rude”, may turn their children off more.\n“If they want to stay close to their kids, they should support them in the process (of becoming an individual), rather than push them away,” Ms Ng said.\nREACHING COMPROMISE\nWhat the counsellors said about these tough conversations requiring time and patience, my friends and I have certainly waded through them.\nSome disagreements I’ve had with my parents have seen me take five steps back before making strides forward.\nBut eventually, I do think progress can be made.\nFor instance, after our family dog of 18 years passed away in 2019, my mother was adamant that we could not have any more pets in the family because she did not feel that my siblings and I were up for the responsibility.\nBut I argued that things were different now — unlike when we first got our dog, I was now an adult and ready to take on all the responsibilities of another pet.\nI tried many ways of convincing her, only for her to say “no” each time.\nThen somehow, early this year, she surprisingly agreed and in May, we welcomed a cat to join the family.\nPerhaps our conversations helped push the needle.\nBut I would also like to believe that my helping around the house and showing that I can be mature and responsible was what sealed the deal.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nTessa Oh is a journalist at TODAY, where she covers health, manpower and the environment."

But its many facets — from managing finances and buying a home to achieving work-life balance — can be overwhelming.\nIn this series, TODAY’s journalists help young Singaporeans navigate this stage of their lives and learn something themselves in the process.\n \nSINGAPORE — I will be the first to admit that I am pretty clueless about insurance. I have heard the words “products”, “premiums”, “coverage” and “claims” being thrown about but have not been able to make much sense of any of it.\nHaving started my first full-time job last year, I was urged by my parents to buy my first insurance policy.\n“I’ll just get whatever she got,” I said to the financial planner who had helped my sister some months before.\nBased on conversations with friends, I know this is common — many of us just buy the same policies that friends or family have. Or when our friends become insurance agents, we buy the plans they offer us without doing much research of our own.\nA friend said: “Honestly, until now, I still don’t know anything about insurance. I just close (my) eyes and pay $7,000 every year.” \nThis past week, I decided to speak to some financial advisers to get some help on how to properly start an insurance portfolio, and they said that this method of blind faith is certainly not the way to go.\nHOW TO GET STARTED\nMr Tan Chin Yu, a client adviser at wealth advisory firm Providend, said: “You should not just blindly buy insurance because you might end up overpaying but still being under-insured for what you really need.”\nExecutive financial consultant Damian Pang said that before buying anything, it is useful to speak to a financial consultant to help with your planning process.\nBesides providing professional financial advice and recommending suitable products, they can share their own experiences and identify possible blind spots you might have, he added.\n“A good analogy is like trying to self-assemble a personal computer for the first time by buying different hardware parts from different sources. It can be a time-consuming and frustrating process,” Mr Pang said.\nMr Tan Siak Lim, the director of financial advisory group Financial Alliance, said that it is important to make comparisons of similar products from various insurance companies. \n“The difference between similar products from different insurance companies can be significant. Also, talk to a few financial advisers to find one who can give you really good advice, because some may focus on selling products instead.” \nWHY IS HEALTH INSURANCE A PRIORITY?\nGiven that most of us do not earn much when we first begin our working lives, health insurance should be our first priority, the advisers said.\nMedical expenses can potentially be a huge financial burden, and locking in lower premiums at a younger age is a good reason to start getting health insurance early.\nAn insurance premium is the amount of money you pay for an insurance policy. Generally, the younger you are at the point of buying a health insurance plan, the lower your premiums will be. \nMr Tan from Financial Alliance said: “It's important to lock in your protection especially if you are still in good health and fully insurable.”\nOnce illness strikes, buying health insurance would be more difficult due to a pre-existing condition and some insurers would even reject you as a customer outright. \nIf one has limited funds and has no insurance plans at all, it is always good to start with a hospitalisation plan first, such as an Integrated Shield Plan from private insurers, Mr Pang said.\n“You can also choose to add a relatively inexpensive but useful accident plan for smaller, more frequent accident-related outpatient bills like sprains, cuts, fractures, falls, burns and the like,” he added.\nSimilarly, Mr Tan from Providend would advise a young person to first think about whether they need an Integrated Shield Plan to supplement their existing MediShield Life.\nMediShield Life is a basic health insurance plan that every Singaporean has. It is administered by the Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board, and helps to pay for large hospital bills and some expensive outpatient treatments such as dialysis and chemotherapy for cancer.\nAn Integrated Shield Plan provides extra private insurance coverage on top of Medishield Life. This can give you benefits such as covering the cost of seeking healthcare from private hospitals or a stay at A- or B1-type wards in public hospitals.\nWHAT’S NEXT?\nSo let’s say I’ve bought an Integrated Shield Plan. What should I think about next?\nMs Viviena Chin, chief executive officer of Eternal Financial Advisory, said the answer is what is called a “rider”.\nWhile an Integrated Shield Plan will cover the big bills that you incur in hospital, it is subject to an annual deductible and 10 per cent co-insurance. A deductible is an initial amount you have to put down for your medical expenses before you can make a claim on your health insurance.\nOf the remaining amount after the deductible, you have to co-pay 10 per cent and your insurer pays the rest.\n“So you will have to ask yourself whether you can afford to take care of the deductible and co-insurance from your own pocket. If not, you have the option to cover that by getting a rider to patch up that amount, but it will still be subject to 5 per cent co-payment,” Ms Chin explained.\nA rider is an insurance policy provision that adds benefits to or amends the terms of a basic insurance policy such as an Integrated Shield Plan.\nMs Chin also noted that an Integrated Shield Plan would not provide an extra lump sum payout to replace your income in the event of diagnosis of early or major illness, and that there are insurance plans that do this.\nShe gave this breakdown of the different types of health insurance plans I could consider after investing in a hospitalisation plan:\nCritical illness plan – To provide a lump-sum payout to replace my income if I am ever diagnosed with a major illness such as cancer. This could help reduce the financial burden of ongoing follow-up expenses.\nDisability income plan – To replace the loss of income if I ever become disabled due to an accident or illness and am unable to go back to work during a stage of life when most people would still be working.\nA plan for long-term care in the event of a severe disability – This would help provide monthly benefits in the wake of a severe disability, should I be unable to perform some daily activities due to an accident or illness. The monthly payout would reduce monthly ongoing expenses, which can be costly.\nWHAT ABOUT HEALTH INSURANCE PROVIDED BY MY COMPANY?\nTo err on the side of caution, the short answer is “no” to depending fully on insurance provided by your employer.\nMr Tan from Financial Alliance said: “To play safe, you should get your personal health insurance and disregard what you have from the company. This is because, firstly, your company coverage may be quite low and with various sub-limits.”\nHe added that the coverage provided is also subject to one’s continuous employment with the company, which is not certain.\nA company might also change or even remove the coverage upon the next policy renewal, he said.\nIn the event that one suddenly suffers from a major illness such as cancer, for example, one may not be able to continue working, resulting in the loss of coverage and income at the worst time.\n\"And you would not be able to buy personal insurance for yourself after that, since you would already have a pre-existing condition,\" he said.\n“Even if none of the above happens and you work there happily until retirement, by then, it’s likely that you may be suffering from some chronic illness, rendering you 'uninsurable'.”\nHOW MUCH SHOULD I BE SPENDING?\nMr Tan from Providend said that some people might advocate setting aside 5 to 10 per cent of your income for insurance premiums, but it is preferable to focus on your needs first and covering those needs in the most cost-efficient manner possible. \n“This is preferable to sticking to a fixed percentage to spend. Everyone’s circumstances can be very different and if one is fortunate enough not to have many dependents and have simpler needs, then they can allocate the savings towards other goals,” he said.\nHow much is too much?\nThis is an interesting question, Mr Pang the financial consultant said, because if everything is going smoothly in life and we don’t have to make a claim from our insurance plans, most of us will feel like we are overspending on premiums.\nHowever, when calamity strikes, many end up wishing that they had invested a lot more in insurance.\nAnd so the key to this, as with most things in life, is balance.\nThe danger of under-insurance is we do not have sufficient protection when unforeseen circumstances strike, whereas over-insuring compromises our ability to enjoy now or save for the future. \nSpeaking to the financial advisers helped me realise the need to truly understand the various insurance plans available and how I should be careful in picking what best suits my needs.\nLike they said, while it may be a tiring and tedious process, sitting down with someone who can break things down for you and best explain your different options is most ideal and is an important step that I will be taking.\nNow that I’ve learnt all this, I will be going back to the adviser who sold me the same plan as my sister to relook its coverage to make sure that it really is ideal for me.\nABOUT THE WRITER:\nNatasha Meah is a journalist at TODAY covering the health, education, community and finance beats"

But its many facets — from managing finances and buying a home to achieving work-life balance — can be overwhelming.\nIn this series, TODAY’s journalists help young Singaporeans navigate this stage of their lives and learn something themselves in the process.\n \nSINGAPORE — As a student, I would often burn the midnight oil to complete my assignments or study for exams.\nSo when I graduated from university about 10 years ago, I thought that I was finally freed from the shackles of late-night studying and meaningless examinations.\nI was raring to embark on my new life as a working adult. Little did I know that I would soon be counting down to my retirement instead.\nWithin the first few months of work, the grind of a five-day work week crept in.\nSimply sitting at a desk from 9am to 5pm turned out to be more exhausting than I expected. I frequently returned home tired after work with no energy for much else except to lounge around before I hit the sack.\nInstead of months-long semester breaks, I now only had the weekends to look forward to.\nAs work piled up, the fatigue carried over to the weekends as well.\nI would cancel social engagements and spend my weekends preparing for upcoming deadlines instead.\nAnd when the next week came around, the routine would repeat itself all over again.\nI started to ask myself: Was this the reality of working life? Is this how I would feel forever? And if I already felt this tired now, how would I have the energy to raise children in future?\n'TIRED OF BEING TIRED'\nA doctor once attributed my fatigue to iron deficiency, a common affliction among young women, but iron tablets did little besides giving me constipation and nausea.\nThe fatigue remained and I eventually realised that I was mentally drained from work — a result of being a “kancheong spider” who is constantly anxious about work.\nAs it turned out, this sense of exhaustion was not just a personality quirk. A quick survey among friends revealed that others felt the same way, too.\nMy cousin, who recently entered the working world, believes that her fatigue stems from the daily grind.\nUnlike academic life where you have clear goals to work towards, there are none at work. New targets come in just after you have vanquished one.\nAnother friend said that she feels a strong social pressure to keep busy and ends up feeling “like a loser” if she does not do as much as others.\nSeveral others said that the blurred lines between work and personal hours working from home during the Covid-19 pandemic had added to the fatigue. One even went as far as to say that she was “tired of being tired”.\nA SYMPTOM OF OTHER ISSUES\nCounsellors that I contacted for this piece said that it is not uncommon for people to feel this way.\nMr Praveen Nair of Raven Counselling and Consultancy said that exhaustion can be episodic such as from staring at a screen for too long. Or it can be chronic, where it is prolonged and has an impact on every facet of life.\nIt is normally a symptom of other issues, rather than a condition or disease.\nIt can be caused by medical disorders such as vitamin deficiencies, workplace-related issues such as burnout, lifestyle-related factors such as poor diet and sleep, and psychological conditions such as stress.\nIn Singapore, fatigue is typically caused by a combination of the above.\nSingaporeans, especially, tire out because of workplace-related factors followed by lifestyle-related factors, Mr Praveen added.\nMs Sophia Goh of Sofia Wellness Clinic said that the pandemic has also exacerbated this sense of fatigue.\n“We might set goals like going on travels, getting married or getting a promotion, but these goals might be completely out of control because of Covid-19,” she said.\nDealing with this sense of perpetual uncertainty — where there is uncertainty over even when the uncertainty will end — can lead to long-term emotional exhaustion, she added.\nAt least one study suggests that Singaporeans are sleeping less and sleeping less well as a result of the pandemic.\nMr Praveen said that the best and cheapest way to tackle fatigue is to have a balanced diet and enough sleep.\nPeople should also try to be less sedentary, reduce their screen time on electronic devices and strive for work-life balance, he added.\nFor fresh graduates getting used to working life, he suggested that they do up a three-year plan to chart their life trajectory. This will help to remind them that there is a purpose to the grind.\nLikewise, Ms Goh suggested that working adults assess if their current life situation is aligned with the values by which they want to live, beyond the academic-driven targets that Singaporeans are used to most of their lives.\nFIGHTING EXHAUSTION\nAlthough I value the advice given by the counsellors, I recognise that any effort one takes to manage his or her fatigue depends on one’s job and circumstances.\nFor example, it is challenging to draw a clear line between work and personal time when I have to work around the schedule of my interviewees.\nIt is also near-impossible to disconnect from social media when you work for an online news website.\nIronically enough, the pandemic has allowed me to manage my fatigue better in spite of the longer working hours.\nWith work-from-home becoming the norm, I am able to save on travel time. The pandemic has also given me the perfect excuse to get out of obligatory social meetings, giving me more control over how I plan my days.\nI have been able to channel my free time into activities that alleviate my fatigue, such as sleep and exercise.\nHowever, I am aware that this is a temporary fix to a problem that I had to deal with long before the pandemic.\nWith working from the office set to resume in the months ahead, at least to some extent, I will have to tackle the fatigue that plagued me once before.\nWILL I EVER STOP FEELING TIRED?\nFor this column, I turned to my supervising editor, who has spent 15 years in this field, to ask whether this feeling of fatigue ever goes away.\nShe, too, had felt very tired when she first started working, eventually hitting rock bottom when she became a mother.\n“I didn’t know what tired really was until then,” she recounted.\nBut it was the push she needed to turn her life around. She started exercising regularly and eventually made other changes to her lifestyle to manage her fatigue, such as eating healthily.\nUltimately though, it will take time for me to get a handle on my fatigue, she said.\n“I spent years training myself to listen to my body. The more you do it, the more attuned you are to your body’s needs,” she added.\nOver time, it will become easier to identify what is causing my tiredness and how to alleviate it, such as getting more sleep or eating regularly, she said.\nAs to my fears of whether I will have the energy for a family, she said: “If you start taking care of yourself now... you’ll have a head start in understanding your own needs, which I’ve found is a very important foundation before you can take care of a child’s needs.”\nKnowing that someone in the same field has managed to tackle her exhaustion gives me some assurance that it is not impossible for me to do so either.\nBut until I get there, I will just take a little nap.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nNavene Elangovan is a senior journalist at TODAY, covering environment and education."

It is a privilege I enjoy.\nEarlier this year, I was working on a series of reports about jobs that are typically overlooked by most of us, such as those in the landscaping or farming sector, and I was inspired by the conviction and passion of my interviewees.\nEven though I love my job, I couldn’t help but muse over the possibilities. Perhaps I could be raising the fry for the next sea bass your mum serves for dinner, or maybe arranging that flower exhibition your girlfriend drags you to on a date?\nBut all these romanticised notions were quickly dispelled by the realities of life — I have a family depending on me financially, so can I risk a pay cut? Besides, I have been in the media industry for more than 10 years, and I know nothing else, let alone agriculture or horticulture.\nAnd so, ruminations about jumping into a completely new career field disappeared — until recently when I was having a conversation with someone about mid-career changes and we wondered how one goes about it.\nRather than continue to theorise about it, I spoke to two individuals who braved the unknown to carve out a new career for themselves.\nI also got the perspectives of two job coaches on mid-career changes for anyone who may be dragging themselves out of bed for work and are just trying to get by each day.\nFINDING YOUR IKIGAI\nHow do you know if you need a career overhaul?\nMs Carmen Wee, a veteran human resource practitioner, said that a person should not pivot to a new field due to a singular event, but rather because “there has been a season of doing one particular kind of work and there isn't any satisfaction or passion for that role”.\nFellow practitioner Adrian Tan said that it would be helpful to approach the matter through the Japanese concept of ikigai — finding joy in life through purpose.\nBroadly, the concept involves seeking the convergence of four elements:\nLoving what you do\nDoing what the world needs\nGetting paid for it\nBeing good at it\nMr Tan said that if you can satisfy the first three elements, “the last will naturally come over a period of practice”.\nIn the case of my two interviewees who have changed careers, they told me they made the switch because they were seeking new knowledge for themselves — whether out of passion or to make up for a missing skill set.\nJournalist-turned-veterinarian Amanda Tan recounted how she was constantly visiting the vet at one point because her pet cat was ill.\nDr Tan, 34, said that she was not only impressed with how knowledgeable the vet was, but she also found it meaningful that the profession involved helping anxious “pet parents” such as her.\nInspired, she left the world of journalism in her mid 20s and is now a veterinary surgeon at the Gentle Oak Veterinary Clinic along Ghim Moh Road.\nFor Mr Law Kia Wei, 36, he said that he was comfortable with his job as an engineer at a semiconductor firm, but he knew that he was lacking a soft skill — interpersonal communications.\nWhen the opportunity arose to take on a role as a medical equipment salesperson at IDS Medical Systems, he accepted it despite some initial hesitation.\nAside from lacking the skills to be an effective salesperson, he also knew next to nothing about the medical field.\nFor close to a year, he said that he struggled before he got into the swing of things. It has now been about seven years, and he is leading his own business unit at the same company and has not looked back.\nOn top of that, he enjoys seeing how his work has a direct impact on the community since it includes working with nursing homes.\nIt is safe to say that Dr Tan and Mr Law have both found their ikigai in their new fields.\nSTEPS TOWARDS CHANGE\nBut how can you follow in their footsteps if you lack qualifications for a field in which you have an interest?\nOne way would be to find traineeships, conversion programmes or even volunteering possibilities just as Dr Tan did.\nAfter leaving journalism, she found a part-time job that gave her enough time to volunteer at a veterinary clinic. That provided her with some hands-on experience and a chance to affirm the decision to move forward with the career switch.\nThe point is to find ways to practise the skills you need. As Mr Tan told me, “no qualification can outweigh” skills or portfolio.\nOf course, sometimes this is not always enough for some professions, and it “may take more than one step” to make that career change, Ms Wee the human resource practitioner said.\nIn Dr Tan’s case, her experience at the clinic affirmed her decision to join the industry full-time, so she furthered her studies by enrolling in a five-year Doctor in Veterinary Medicine course at Murdoch University in Perth, Australia.\nSACRIFICE AND COURAGE\nStill, making the transition towards a new career will not be a walk in the park, as testified by Dr Tan and Mr Law, who spoke about the sacrifices that they had to make.\nFor instance, they described how they spent hours each day studying to make up for the lack of knowledge in their respective fields.\nAs an older student paying for her own education, Dr Tan said that the stakes were high. “Whatever effort that you put in is going to directly affect your outcome,” she said.\nThat said, being an older student also meant that she was better able to appreciate the opportunity to study — unlike her younger self — which gave her the focus to make it work for her.\nAnother key factor is to expect a pay cut.\nDr Tan and Mr Law both said that they saw their salary drop by at least 15 per cent.\n“If you jump industry, it’s expected since you have not proven yourself. It was something I had to make peace with,” Mr Law added.\nHowever, he said that if one is willing to learn and “tough it out”, the “salary will come back to you”.\nOn this point, Ms Wee said that this could take a few years, and so the risks and financial trade-offs for a younger professional might be lower than for someone older.\nMoreover, current financial commitments should be factored in as well. Can you afford to take a pay cut after making the necessary adjustments to your lifestyle?\nIf age is a concern, Dr Tan’s advice is not to worry because she has met a number of colleagues who graduated in their late 30s after undergoing a mid-career switch themselves.\n“You’re not too old to make a change... It just requires a bit of sacrifice and courage,” she said.\nMs Wee said, though, that older workers also need to be realistic about the level of seniority that they can achieve for a particular role, given the need to catch up.\nShe also stressed the importance of doing your homework on the new field, and being aware that you will be competing with others who already possess the relevant experience.\nBut that should not discourage older workers. Mr Tan said that it is about being aware of the skills you can bring to the table and connecting the dots.\n“If you’ve done logistics but wish to get into marketing, what are the things you learned in logistics that are applicable?\n“Perhaps it is the way you plan things, which can be applied to a marketing department running a webinar?”\nGREATER THINGS AHEAD\nAssuming your personal affairs are in order, the decision to change careers really boils down to what meaning you are hoping to derive out of your job.\n“If you’ve a high paying job... but you’re unmotivated, eight hours at work will feel like 24. I think that’s quite torturous,” Mr Law said.\nAnd for those in their 30s, or even 40s, Dr Tan pointed out that there is still quite a long runway until they hit their retirement age.\nJust because someone has invested a lot of time into their career, it should not be seen as too precious to give up if they are unhappy, she said.\n“Don’t be in a position where you look back when you’re older and wish you had made the change when you could,” Dr Tan said. “There can be far greater things ahead than what you leave behind.”\nABOUT THE WRITER:\nLow Youjin is a senior journalist at TODAY where he covers the environment, manpower, as well as court and crime beats."

            "Article Body": "The tears that flowed once I crossed the finish line at the 19th Asian Games on Oct 2, 2023, pretty much said it all. \nIt was the cherry on top of a magical 2023 season: I broke national records and personal bests, I championed the continent on a few occasions, heard Majulah Singapura play from atop those podiums and, sweetest of all, qualified for the 2024 Paris Olympics. \nFor context, this does not come by very often. Athletes generally don’t see this many successes and continued breakthroughs in such a short period of time. But that’s just how it is in a sport: It’s normal not to see progress for a while.      \nWith that, I have so many people to thank for a truly magical year: My coach, family, sport science team, and the list goes on. \n     \nI have myself to thank, too. I owe my success to my younger self, who had to go through years of doubt, desolation, and unlucky circumstances in order to get here. But all those experiences only made her stronger than ever before. \nA lot of people know me as Singapore’s Sprint Queen — a title I first got in 2013 when I became the first woman to run the 100m event in under 12 seconds and the 200m in 24 seconds. \nThis label gained even more traction after I clinched Singapore’s first sprint gold at the 2015 Southeast Asian (SEA) Games. Before that, we hadn’t won one in 42 years. \nThis was a pivotal time in my track and field journey. I was launched into both the athletic scene as well as the public eye, and from this point on, I got a taste of what being in high-performance sports is like. \nI stepped onto a new track, one that came with amazing opportunities, incredible exposure, and a pathway to pursue this sport long-term. \nBut it also came with a lot of expectations and a lot of pressure, both external and internal, which I was neither prepared for nor had the experience to fully understand and accept. \nPerhaps it was arrogance; perhaps it was just a lack of dealing with the immense pressures following a remarkable feat. \nRegardless of what it was, when I could not uphold the same title of SEA Games Gold Medallist in 2017, I felt like a complete failure. I thought I no longer had what it took to be Singapore’s Sprint Queen. \nAt the same time, I was coming off a less than ideal coach-athlete relationship and other life struggles, including the loss of two academic scholarships within a week of each other. I had to figure out how I was going to settle my tuition fees, along with extra cash for spending and saving. \nAll these setbacks made for some rough years as a young adult. I found myself at such a loss of what to do and who I was.\n     \nI succumbed to what others thought of my abilities, giving them the power to dictate what I should do with my life. I questioned everything about myself, to the point where I became so afraid of even approaching the start line. \nMy mind was stuck in a cloud of fear and uncertainty: Once I crossed the finish line, would another wave of disappointment kick in? Would people say I was weak, that I was not good enough?\nRight before the 31st SEA Games in May 2022, something clicked. \n“Who cares?” I realised. “Who cares what people think? Why am I allowing them to define who I am? I started track 18 years ago because I loved it — why should I let people who matter the least to me determine my next steps?” \n     \nSuddenly, my mind was clear. I knew exactly what I had to do, and how to do it. \nI started to look at my failures and mistakes less as weaknesses, but more as strengths — points of my life that I could learn from to become more of a master in my speciality, and to become a better version of myself. \nWhy bother wallowing in self-pity when there’s absolutely nothing I can do about it anymore? I can’t change the past, so why not think instead about how to do better in the future? \nI’ve never thought that resilience is something people are born with — but I did think of it as something everyone organically builds simply by experiencing setbacks, failures and mistakes. \nWhat I’ve learned is that resilience is a result of actually learning from these setbacks and failures and choosing to alter your path ahead of you for the better. \nI was no longer afraid, and I found my love for the sport again. \nFast forward to January 2024: I successfully defended my 200m SEA Games title two years in a row (2022 and 2023) and earned the gold in the 100m in 2023 as well. \nI ran the 200m in under 23 seconds for the first time, became Singapore's first Asian Champion in both events, made it to the semifinals of the World Championships, qualified for the Olympics and earned the 200m Gold and 100m Silver at the 19th Asian Games — all while setting personal bests, national and championship records in the process. \nThe best part is that I am nowhere near done.      \nI’m now training towards the next big thing: The 2024 Paris Olympics in July. I’m having the time of my life — all because I decided to live my life for myself, not for others. \nHigh expectations and tough pressures are part and parcel of being an athlete, so I now cope with it by accepting it for what it is — something that naturally occurs when achieving something great in the public eye that is simply beyond my control. \nSo, I’ve stopped trying to control the expectations, pressures, and the comments from strangers on the Internet.\nInstead, I focus on the things that I can control: My training and competition plans, my personal routines, staying disciplined and consistent in my habits, and my attitude and adaptability. \nIn professional sports, hard work is not enough.\nBeing an athlete is not confined to time spent on the track. It’s a 24/7 job, placing my sport as a priority above everything else and continually working on recovery, which is just as important as showing up to the track, if not more so.\nIt requires big lifestyle changes, and an intentional change in perspective of what I do.\nGearing up for Paris 2024, my plans for the year are made up of large sacrifices.\nI have to spend the majority of my time overseas, away from friends and family, missing events and milestones along the way. I have to stay disciplined with my time and routines on a daily basis — no late nights, no casual drinking, and eating right, all of which can be hard to maintain for months on end. \nBecause of these demands, my circle of friends has naturally grown smaller — but I’m not upset about it, because the people who have remained truly understand my lifestyle and have shown that they will support me no matter what.\nThe inaugural Singapore Resilience Study, released in September 2023 by Income Insurance Limited and Centre for Research on Successful Ageing at the Singapore Management University, categorises resilience into four domains — physical, mental, financial and social. \nPersonally, I see that all four types are important for each of us to be empowered to overcome the challenges we face in life. \nUltimately, I do not regret those seven years of hardship because they have made me into the person I am today, and I’m proud of that. \nTo anyone out there who may be struggling to find your footing again — don’t be afraid to accept your mistakes, learn from them and come back stronger.\nOne of the lessons my past struggles have taught me is to be more prudent in my spending and save as much as I can for the future. It’s true that sports careers don’t last as long as others do, but all I can do is to, again, focus on the things I can control. \nI’m thankful that I’ve gotten to a point in my career where I can see a steady pay cheque, racing bonuses and additional media engagements. I have paid back my student loans entirely, and saved up enough to begin making investments that will help me build the future I want, whatever obstacles and hardships I may face.  \nI take these lessons with me throughout every single point of my life.\nIn my sport and my life now — and in the future, when I eventually retire — my strategies will remain the same. I will focus on the things within my control, embrace every single opportunity that I get, appreciate the people around me and enjoy the process, no matter what it might be.\nRegardless of who’s watching on the sidelines of my life, it’s me on the track, putting one foot in front of the other. Only I have the power to determine what happens in my journey.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nShanti Pereira, 27, is Singapore's “Sprint Queen” with multiple national records and medals at the SEA Games. She is the fastest Southeast Asian woman ever in the 100m and 200m events. She represented Singapore at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics in the 200m event. At the 2022 Hangzhou Asian Games, she won a Gold in the 200m event and Silver in the 100m. At the 2023 Asian Athletics Championships, she won a double Gold in the 100m and 200m."

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "Can you remember the last time you disagreed with somebody? \nHow did you tell them about it? What were you more concerned about — whether you were communicating your point effectively, or whether you were in danger of offending them or hurting their feelings? \nDid you tell them to their face? Or did you wait till you parted ways to drop them a text? \nDid you even tell them at all? Or did you confide your dissent only to trusted friends, knowing they would keep your secret?\nOn a recent trip with friends, we spent a week giggling our way through South Korea. \nWe drove on the wrong lane in Jeju, tried raw marinated crab for the first time in Yeosu, and gorged ourselves on street food in Seoul. \nWe slept on futons in a traditional Korean hotel and joked about being in our Jewel in the Palace era. We ziplined off the 24th floor of a Ramada hotel and made fun of ourselves for it on social media: “Your unemployed friends on a Tuesday afternoon”.\nWanting to spend more time together, we shelled out for an AirBnB large enough to accommodate us all. We got to know each other better over long conversations about our families and friends, our past lovers and partners, and our jobs (for real though, do you know what your friends actually do for work?).\nWe were having a good time. \nFor dinner on our last night, someone suggested Korean BBQ (or, as it’s known there, BBQ). \nIt’s a truth universally acknowledged that last-night dinners on overseas trips are special. People are worn in by then, happy but exhausted. Guards are let down; everything seems to draw out longer and lazier as we try to make the most of these last hours. \nThe part of the dinner where we were actually eating food transitioned into the part where we picked at the remaining “courtesy” morsels, just to have an excuse to keep talking. \nA sensitive topic came up in conversation. Nothing new — we’re generally pretty comfortable with discussing all sorts of things with each other, and had been doing so throughout the entire trip.\nOne of the group voiced an opinion they described as “preference”. I felt it was prejudice — and I told them so, right then and there. \nA debate sparked right away — not heated, exactly, but it ramped up the longer it went on. The whole group got involved. Everybody wanted to share their take on it; everybody wanted to know what was behind each other’s take. \nSoon enough, other sensitive topics were drawn into the fray. Not being one to mince words, I once again expressed a contrary sentiment — and that’s when something snapped.\nPeople lost control of their emotions. We talked over each other. Spoke in accusatory tones. Got personal.\nIt went on as we paid the bill and left the restaurant. \nIt went on in the cab ride home.\nIt went on once we were back in our AirBnB.\nAll considered, it went on for nearly five hours, give or take. (There was definitely a moment or two where I lowkey regretted our halcyon decision to get that AirBnB together.)\nWhat were we talking about? Frankly, it doesn’t matter. It could have been anything, really. \nWhat I did find myself thinking about long after that conversation had ended was the nature of disagreement.\nIt’s no surprise that a lot of people aren’t comfortable with disagreement — the very concept does inherently require some measure of tension or friction, after all. \nThat discomfort is compounded several times over when it’s in relation to a sensitive topic, and understandably so. \nThis is why politics and sexuality are big no-no’s for first-date conversations. Singaporeans, in particular, are notoriously apprehensive when it comes to talking about race and race-related issues. \nThe key concerns are always the same: It’s too easy to offend; people are too easily offended.\nBut what does it really mean to offend, or to be offended? Surely there can be no harm in expressing a personal thought or sentiment as long as it’s supported with genuine, positive intent? \nWhat if what we’re really afraid of is disagreement itself? \nHumans are communal animals. No one likes feeling alone, or like we’re being forcibly divided or separated from others. This is the entire basis and appeal of social media: Connect with people whenever you want from wherever you are! Find others who like the same things you like, so you never have to like them alone! \nBut all that communality cannot change the fact that we are individualised persons, each with our own thoughts and feelings. \nIt’s what makes human connection so powerful and beautiful. \nIt’s also the reason why we will never be able to create an environment, physical or virtual, that is completely free of disagreement.\nTo be fair, disagreement can be scary sometimes — but that doesn’t mean we have to be afraid of it. \nPicture two people living together in one house.\nDisagreement doesn’t automatically mean one of them moving out into a different house. It can simply be the occupants working together to create a new room within the house — carving out space for more of their individual selves to fit under the same roof. \nIn that sense, disagreement doesn’t have to mean opposition or divergence. Instead, it can be an avenue of diversification and deeper intimacy. \nThe key to this distinction is intention: Are we seeking total alignment and affirmation for the sake of self-assurance, or are we seeking real and whole understanding of others’ perspectives? Are we willing to make room within ourselves to hold those perspectives, even if they may be different from what we want or believe?\nIn case you’re wondering, all friendships in our group remain alive and well. \nBut towards the end of that long, long night, one of the group observed that it’s pretty rare for friends and other social groups to be able to disagree as intensely as we had done and still be able to carry on with the friendship or social connection. \nI can’t speak for each of them — but for me personally, it’s going to take a lot more than a difference in opinion to break me apart from someone I’ve made a decision to love. \nPerhaps it’s time to start trusting that the bonds we share with our loved ones are a lot stronger than we give them credit for.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nMelissa Lee Suppiah is a deputy editor at TODAY where she oversees commentaries.

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "Whenever someone asks me what I do in a bank, they’re surprised when I tell them I work with migrant workers. \nAs a university graduate with a Bachelor’s degree in business studies and finance, most people expect me to be in corporate or private banking, rubbing shoulders with high-net-worth individuals and the like.\nMy current department handles the work permit segment. When I first joined four years ago, I was concerned about the fluency of my spoken Tamil — but to be honest, I wasn’t too sure about the prospect of working with migrant workers. \nLike many of my friends and relatives, I harboured a jaundiced view of migrant workers at the time, a perception that was probably unhelpfully shaped by the Little India riots in 2013. \nMy parents were concerned as well, but nevertheless I decided to take a leap of faith and try it out. I told myself that there was a job to be done, and I would just go into this with an open mind.\nWithin the first few months of taking on my new role, my misconceptions slowly melted away. As I helped migrant and domestic workers with their account opening and banking enquiries, I found them shy, polite and appreciative of the help rendered to them. \nEven so, it was still a job to me then and nothing more. That was the case until 2020, when I completed one year in the role. \nI remember how I was put in touch with the wife of a migrant worker who had passed away from a workplace incident that fateful year. \nShe had contacted her husband’s employer to seek help for the money in his POSB account to be transferred back to India. \nThat was the very first time my department and I had to assist with a request from a deceased worker’s next-of-kin. \nFrankly, I was worried: What if I made a mistake that could hinder the speedy resolution of the request? I was also sad that a man’s life had ended — what if I couldn’t keep my emotions in check when speaking with his wife?\nShe lived in a small village in Coimbatore, a city in Tamil Nadu, India, and I had to do multiple calls with her to get the required information and documents mailed to Singapore in order to process the remittance request. \nIt was a laborious process as we had to liaise with many different parties. I also had to keep my emotions in check whenever I spoke with the widow. \nI knew I could not do much to assuage her grief, but I resolved to do what was within my means to the best of my ability.\nSo, I expedited the paperwork for the worker’s hard-earned savings to be remitted to his family in India, who urgently needed the money to get by. \nIt took a lot of work, but the wife received the funds within a month. As she expressed her relief and gratitude, it struck me then that my job wasn’t “just a job”. It meant so much more to the people on the receiving end of my assistance. \nFrom that point on, I began to see my role in a new light.\nMy team and I also partner with government agencies and non-government organisations to conduct workshops under the POSB’s Work Permit Holders Digital Literacy programme for migrant and domestic workers. \nAn important aspect of our workshops is teaching these vulnerable groups to identify scam calls and messages such as emails. Foreign domestic workers risk falling prey to scammers with fake job offers promising fast cash, while migrant workers are especially susceptible to scammers posing as government officials.\nWe typically run two workshops a month for up to 200 migrant workers at a time. For domestic workers, because of their rest days, we run workshops on alternate months for between 60 and 80 attendees. \nOne of the main challenges faced by migrant workers is the language barrier, as many of them have limited proficiency in English. This makes it difficult for them to interpret messages effectively, leading to misunderstandings and potential exploitation. \nWorking in a new environment further compounds the risks. As they are unfamiliar with local law processes, this group could be easily cowed into giving away their banking credentials when faced with intimidation or threats by “government officials”. \nAmid the rising prevalence of scams, I wanted to do more to extend and expand our digital literacy outreach to migrant workers. \nIn 2023, I initiated a “train-the-trainer programme” where I would educate a few “big brothers” and “big sisters” as digital literacy ambassadors, so that they could go out and share their knowledge with fellow workers and friends. \nSince the programme’s start, I have personally trained 40 ambassadors.\nAs I continue to become more invested in what I do, I found that my work is not just a job, but also about fulfilling a desire to help the vulnerable. \nBecause migrant and domestic workers work long hours and are often unable to visit bank branches during office hours, I would head out to condominiums, hospitals, and construction sites after office hours and even on weekends, just so I could reach out to these groups. I assist them with their banking queries and difficulties, and listen to them sharing their personal problems. \nMaking sure that my phone is switched on around the clock, I often get WhatsApp messages late at night seeking advice on a myriad of issues.\nI’ve spent the past three Deepavalis at dormitories celebrating the festive occasion with migrant workers, as well as conducting digital literacy sessions on a public holiday. \nAt the beginning, I would tell myself to draw a clearer distinction between work and my personal life, but the more people I met and the more I came to understand their concerns and issues, the more I found myself motivated to help them in whatever little way I could. \nI’ve also found friends: Last year, I invited Krishna — a migrant worker from India and one of the ambassadors I trained — to my house for dinner with my family.\nIt can be lonely being away from your loved ones on a major festive occasion such as Deepavali. It warmed my heart when Krishna thanked me for opening my house to him and allowing him to feel a sense of family on this special day.\nIn a world where self-advancement often takes centre stage, it's easy to turn a blind eye to the struggles faced by others, especially those sidelined to the margins of mainstream society. \nI’ve learnt that it’s important for Singapore to continue amplifying the voices of migrant and domestic workers by providing platforms for them to share their stories and perspectives, and to advocate for themselves, whether through art, media, or community forums.\nWe must also continue to create more inclusive environments that are welcoming and supportive of the vulnerable groups who have travelled far from their homelands and communities to build our houses and roads and look after our parents and children.\nThe past four years have taught me that life is about so much more than chasing the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. In an increasingly digitalised world with widening social and economic inequality, I believe that everyone can give a little of themselves to bring about positive change.\nIn the grand scheme of things, my efforts may be just a ripple — but even the smallest of ripples can become a big wave of change. \nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nRishma Theru, 28, is a business manager for the Work Permit segment at DBS Bank’s consumer banking group."

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "It started with a YouTube video.\nThe year was 2015: During the long wait between junior college and university, I spent my afternoons coaching softball part-time, which meant that I had ample time to kill in the mornings. \nOne morning, a cupcake tutorial by CupcakeJemma popped up on my explore page. Not a lot of people know this, but I’ve got a string of disastrous baking attempts on my record from when I was younger. Even now, I don’t really know what it was that made me want to try out that video — a need to scratch some creative itch? Boredom? A bit of both? \nWhatever it was, this particular batch of cupcakes came out great, much to my own surprise, and got positive feedback from family and friends. \nI immediately started trying out different flavours and variations, fascinated by the way the simple concept of a cupcake could produce countless end results. Within a few months, I was hooked. My baking output quickly outpaced the rate at which my family and friends were consuming my bakes.\nAt that point, I plucked up the courage to create an Instagram page to sell my bakes, soon upgrading from cupcakes to simple cakes. Receiving orders was so exciting; each one was an opportunity to feed my growing interest in baking. \nLooking back on them, I now think those first bakes were horrible — but hey, we all start somewhere. \nAll through university, I spent my weekdays in classes and my weekends baking orders. I appreciated the small side income my “hobby” provided me but, to be perfectly honest, I didn’t have any concrete idea of what I wanted to do with it. \nDoubt loomed in my mind: “Am I good enough to pursue this as a career? Where can this business go? If I commit to this, what will the next few years look like?”\nUpon graduation in July 2019, I told my mum and dad that I wanted to take a stab at turning my home-based side hustle into a full-time job. \nIt took my practical-minded parents some convincing, and I had to make some concessions: I promised them that, should the business not work out after a year, I would pack up my spatulas and find a “regular” corporate job instead. \nConfession: I wasn’t sure I was making the right decision at the time. For all my attempts at allaying my parents’ doubts, my own lingered — but all I knew was that I needed to give my passion for baking a fair shot.  \nFor the next six months, I poured countless hours into recipe development and took on as many orders as I could to grow the business. Frosted by Fang was a one-woman show, and I had to very quickly learn to wear multiple hats at once: Logistics manager, social media marketer, business administrator and customer service officer, all while furthering my own baking self-education.\nThen Covid-19 hit. \nThe world came to a standstill — but my business got a sudden boost. In the midst of lockdowns and minimised socialisation, sending care packages became the new norm, and my mixed dessert boxes, which now included brownies, cookies, tarts and more, quickly became a hit.  \nComing out of the pandemic, I did my very first pop-up at Baker X in mid-2022. It was the first time that I could interact with customers in person, a human element I had been missing as a home-based business. A couple for whom I’d done an order of gender reveal cupcakes in 2019 dropped by with their little one in tow — and it struck me hard how gratifying it was to be, through my bakes, a part of people’s lives and cherished milestones.\nBy then, I’d managed to save up enough to enrol in a two-month pastry course in Bordeaux, France — my first brush with formal baking instruction after years of being entirely self-taught. \nBeing able to work in a larger kitchen with industrial equipment sparked a new dream in me: Could I one day have my own space to bake in? The spark became a flame when I returned to Singapore and realised that my business demands had outgrown the production capacity my home kitchen could offer. \nDespite the success I’d seen up till then, Doubt’s nagging voice lingered in my head. Setting up any kind of physical store would be an uphill task unlike anything I’d faced before, comprising mounds of paperwork, logistical dilemmas and nightmares, and endless planning. But I knew the only way to overcome my reservations was to just bite the bullet. \nAfter a long and rocky location scouting process, I finally found my dream spot in Joo Seng Green, but the space itself was not fit to run a food-and-beverage business in — which meant many more months spent getting approvals for licensing, appropriate alterations and fittings, and so on. \nWith a lot of help from my family, friends and partner, the shop slowly but surely started to take shape. In August 2023, I officially opened its doors for business.\nMy little shop is the hardest thing I have ever done, and it’s still early days, but I have not regretted my decision one bit. With the addition of a physical location, the number of hats I wear has practically doubled. It’s overwhelming at times, but I have never felt more fulfilled. \nThe learning curves along the way were even steeper than I’d anticipated, but I never would have gotten anywhere without them. Every mistake allowed me to better the business and myself. \nMy mother also came onboard as my first (and only) full-time employee, handling front-of-house service in the store. As we grow older, work typically takes us further away from our parents — but I’m grateful for all the time being in the store has allowed my mum and I to spend together and how much closer we’ve gotten because of it.\nMy store also gives me the chance to get to know the residential community and even make friends with many of my newfound regulars. Frosted by Fang would not be where it is today without their generous love and support. \nSometimes I do think it would be nice to have some of the things a “regular” corporate job affords my peers — paid time off, medical coverage, weekends free to spend with loved ones, among others — but ultimately, these are sacrifices worth making in pursuit of my passion for baking.\nWhere will my little “hobby” take me next? I don’t know for sure — but I’ve learnt to accept that my old friend Doubt will still be a visitor from time to time, dropping in and making his uncomfortable presence felt. \nRushing to dismiss him in hopes that he will disappear doesn’t work, though. Rather, I’ve learnt to sit with him for a while and the questions his presence brings, so I can focus on assessing what is within my control and what isn’t. \nMore than that, I’ve learnt not to let Doubt stop me from taking action. The more I do and the more knowledge and experience I gather, the more I can build up my own courage and, eventually, my visitor will naturally take his leave. \nIt’s okay to be afraid; what matters is you do it anyway. \nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nLee Su Fang, 27, is the founder of Frosted by Fang. She has a degree in communications and media studies from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore."

            "Article Body": "“What do you mean, you don’t know?” \nI stared blankly at my boss, totally lost for words. \nThe footnote he was questioning me about stared back at me from the very bottom of a dense document — to some, a small oversight; to me, an indelible hallmark of my latest failure. \nIn my defence, it was among hundreds of documents I was typically assigned to read each night — but this was not the first mistake I would make at this particular job, nor would it be the last. \nThat particular meeting had been a breaking point of sorts. After it, I sat down at my desk and asked myself, for the very first time in my life: “Am I really that bad at what I do?”\nMy father is a self-made man who had climbed the corporate ladder to become chief executive of an international company. He’d ingrained in me from a young age that I should aspire to be “a scholar in the classroom, an athlete on the field, and a master in the performance hall”.\nI was the typical “model student”, graduating with straight As from secondary school and junior college while holding leadership positions in multiple co-curricular activities — captain of the rugby team; vice-president of debate club; even head prefect. \nAt university, I did a double degree in business and law, and took well to both disciplines. I graduated with first-class honours in both my degrees and emerged class valedictorian. \nAfter a short training period at a local law firm, I was invited to work for the Supreme Court, the highest judicial court in Singapore. Only the top 1 per cent of each law cohort receive such invitations, and as a 25-year-old at the start of his professional journey, I felt extremely honoured. \nI loved everything about the job. My bosses were kind, the work meaningful and fulfilling. I had amazing colleagues, many of whom I remain good friends with today. \nUp until that point, I’d never really had any significant setbacks in my life, aside from a few bumps and hitches. I naively assumed the next phase of my career would be just as smooth-sailing. \nAfter a few years, I wanted to delve deeper into the world of business. So I left the Supreme Court and joined a Magic Circle firm (the term bestowed on the five most prestigious multi-national law firms headquartered in London).\nGoing into it, I knew that navigating the jump from public litigation to private corporate work would be difficult — but I saw it as just another challenge which I would successfully tackle. After all, that was what my entire life had set me up to expect, right? \nThe reality could not have been further from my imagination. \nEach day in my new job was a struggle in a way I had never experienced before. \nI struggled to pick up a subject in which I’d had almost no prior exposure. While the firm had offered me a title appropriate for my years of practice and assigned me work accordingly, I struggled to keep up with peers and even juniors with more relevant experience.  \nI struggled to adjust to a new culture and method of learning. In my previous job, I’d been guided by more experienced seniors; here, I was expected to learn everything by myself on the fly. \nI struggled to relate to my bosses, some of whom had different working styles and priorities than I was used to. \nNearly two years and a litany of mistakes later, it was clear that I was not doing well in this job. \nDoubt overtook me — so much so that I went on an introspection exercise, calling up five ex-colleagues and close friends, and asking them to tell me what they thought my strengths and weaknesses were. \nEventually, I had to admit defeat and leave the firm. I was jaded. Tired. Discouraged, and honestly, a little bit lost as to what had happened. \nTwo months later, I joined another practice to pursue tech (something I’d always loved). I worked with startups, venture capital funds, and gaming companies.\nAnd, over time, I started to really enjoy what I do again. \nSome things that helped were a genuine interest in the subject matter, a better culture fit, and a more relatable boss — but here’s what really struck me upon starting anew.\nIt took some time, but it soon dawned on me that I had learnt and grown so much during my years of painful, uncomfortable struggle. The countless nights spent trading sleep for work, the 7.30am meetings (that usually followed a 4am late night), the harsh and sometimes unnecessarily snide remarks. \nSomewhere in the midst of all that struggle, I’d picked up far more than I even realised. Every single mechanism, arrangement, process, and type of agreement — even as I’d been drowning, bit by bit, everything was getting retained in its own way.\nEverything I had learnt then helped me to prosper in the next phase of my career. By drowning a bit (or what felt like a lot), I had somehow learnt how to swim. \nLearning something new is always hard. Sometimes, it’s really hard. \nBut that first intense period of struggle and discomfort is a necessary first hurdle to getting on track.\nGetting in shape? The first 2 km is the worst.\nStamping out bad habits? The first two months are the hardest.\nLearning a new language? The first 10 lessons are the most uncomfortable.\nBut if you keep your head down, and stick to it with perseverance and humility, everything will fall in place. Because failure can really suck — but it can be a great teacher.\nI left legal practice in 2022 to start my own tech company in the blockchain and video gaming space. The last two years have felt almost like a repeat of the two years I spent struggling and drowning in that Magic Circle firm. \nThe patterns are strikingly similar: Jumping into a new discipline; taking on new tasks and responsibilities for the first time; always feeling like I can’t catch up with everyone else who has more experience. My co-founder and I also made our fair share of mistakes as we built the company from the ground up. \nDon’t get me wrong — I still hate failing. But I now see that failure is an essential part of learning. \nIn my new role as a boss, I also find it much easier to empathise with others when mistakes are made. \nAs we step into 2024, I find myself armed with a quiet confidence that the hard work, suffering and struggle will prepare me for whatever will come next. \nOur failures don’t have to define us — with the right attitude and perspective, they can become small but valuable footnotes in our stories, enriching the pages with lessons learned and wisdom earned. \nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nNathanael Lim, 38, is the co-founder of Avium, a venture-backed gaming creator company with presences in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam."

            "Article Body": "Finding joy in motherhood seems to come naturally and easily to most new mothers. \nYet, my own experience revolved mainly around grappling with the demands of parenting, thoughts of my life solely centering on my newborn, and steadily losing my grip on sanity. \nI became a first-time mother in 2017, and suffered from postnatal depression. My focus then was just to get through each day. \nEven though my family was supportive, I still felt overwhelmed and struggled ceaselessly with anxiety and guilt. \nThis was not the first time I’ve experienced an episode of poor mental health, and I knew I had to do something. \nIn my early years as a school teacher, I had faced burnout and exhibited signs of depression. I withdrew from social interactions and lost joy in my day-to-day activities. \nDespite reaching out to professionals for help, I couldn't seem to find a way out. \nIt was through sheer determination and the support of family and friends that I eventually pulled through that dark period.\nWith no prior drawing or illustration background, I started doodling during pockets of free time between motherhood duties — a hobby I embarked on in an attempt to keep my intrusive thoughts at bay. \nI approached my art journey with an open mind, believing that consistent practice leads to progress. \nWhile I lacked formal training, I drew inspiration from other accomplished illustrators on social media who began their careers without prior experience. Their success stories motivated me to invest time and effort into honing my craft.\nThe time spent on art diverted my attention from overthinking, and I also became more mindful of my own thoughts as I learnt to slow them down.\nArt quickly became my most valuable therapeutic outlet, providing solace and aiding my emotional well-being. On difficult days, it helped me to look back on the progress I've made on my mental health journey, reminding me of my own resilience.\nI soon started an Instagram page (@a.kinderspace) as a way to document my own artworks — but I soon found many opportunities to connect with other individuals responding to my struggles, and even sharing their own personal hardships.\nI wound up creating a safe space for sharing relatable mum struggles. \nMost of my inspiration comes from people around me, inadvertently providing solace and encouragement during challenging times. \nSometimes it’s as simple as a quote that I stumble upon online or in a book, or a positive memory from my own life. \nFinding ways to cheer and motivate myself on difficult days can be hard sometimes — but the possibility of my illustrations being able to do the same for others going through tough times of their own is a powerful source of comfort and encouragement.\nMy art journey began as a search for distraction from my thoughts. Funnily enough, it has not only made me more mindful in my thoughts, but has also become a tool to advocate mental wellness — prioritising self-love and normalising speaking up about needing help. \nThe magic lies in being intentional with what we feed our minds, and acknowledging that life has its ups and downs. \nEven now, I am thankful that my illustrations serve a purpose, be it raising awareness about mental health issues or comforting and encouraging someone else in the same mental space as me.\nOur lives are a never-ending race against time.\nThe demands of work, family and personal responsibilities can create a whirlwind of pressure, leaving us grappling with the weight of expectations and the perpetual quest for balance. \nAmid the whirlwind of daily tasks and life's challenges, it's easy to lose sight of our mental well-being. \nCreativity has become an integral part of my life, providing a channel for self-expression and connection with others. \nMy first solo exhibition “Hi K, I’ve Got This: Drawing Perseverance” opened on Nov 2, 2023. My display, made possible by the Singapore Chinese Cultural Centre, offers a visual narrative for the silent battles we fight and the struggles we all endure each day. \nThe featured illustrations centre on a “bungirl” character named K, short for ‘okay’. Through her adventures, K embodies strength, resilience, and the courage to face difficulties head-on. \nEach illustration is a reminder that, despite the chaos, we possess an inner strength capable of weathering life’s storms.\nMy work has always been about embracing imperfections, self-compassion, and dismantling the stigma surrounding mental health challenges.\nBy fostering an open conversation about mental wellness, my art aims to create a space where we can find solace, connection, and inspiration amid life's challenges. For me, this exhibition is another step in my endeavour to encourage myself and others to acknowledge our struggles, and to seek support when we need it.\nThese days, I’ve learned to better regulate my emotions, and to acknowledge that each day, whether positive or challenging, contributes to my personal growth. \nIt’s okay not to be okay. Most importantly, know that no matter the circumstances, there’s always room for hope.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nPaige Lee, is an educator and self-taught illustrator advocating for mental well-being through her illustrations and words via her Instagram page @a.kinderspace.

            "Article Body": "My third pregnancy was not as smooth as my first two.\nAt 28 weeks, we received news that Sonia had intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Something was obstructing the nourishment she was meant to receive and could potentially obstruct blood flow to her brain. Her birth was also likely to be induced prematurely. \nBut my doctor’s hope was that she would make it to full term with mature lungs. She wanted to do a C-section to get Sonia out once she hit the 37-week mark.\nThe rest of the pregnancy from there on was wrought with tension. I had to monitor Sonia’s movements throughout the day to make sure she was still alive. We had to look for a nanny to prepare for a C-section. \nAt the same time, we also had two other young children to care for.\nAlong the way, a few more scares were added to the mix. \nSonia’s weight dropped from the 10th percentile to the fifth; her blood flow was decreasing; and at the 32-week mark I was put on bed rest after false labour.\nI had to start medications to slow down contractions, lower my blood pressure, and delay labour. I took four steroid shots over the next three days to prepare Sonia’s lung’s for premature birth.\nSuffice to say, our plate was very full.\nEverything around us was messy and uncertain, and we had no assurance of any particular outcome. Still, we didn’t feel overwhelmed with worry or fear about Sonia. Our faith told us God was very in control of all the moving parts; whatever the outcome, we would make it through.\nTwo weeks later, we got the miraculous update that Sonia was no longer a critical case: her growth percentile was up, and blood flow to her brain was fine. Things seemed back on track.\nOn May 21, 2021, Sonia was born, weighing in at 2kg. Other than hypothyroidism, a condition commonly related to IUGR, she was given a clean bill of health. \nFor the first seven months of her life, she gained weight steadily.\nThen for the next one and a half years, she would barely gain a kilogram.\nHer paediatrician, who specialises in newborns with low birth weights, was puzzled, especially given she was not my first child and I would know what normal food intake was like, something I reported dutifully. When Sonia missed several of her milestones, we put it down to her being on the smaller side of the curve.\nStill, after a while, something seemed amiss, and the doctor began referring us to genetics doctors and nutritionists. Calories, vitamin supplements, and special formula milk were added to her diet. \nNo change.\nAll this was so new to me. Never before had I had to care so much about how much protein and calories my kids were eating. I just fed them “healthy” food and both had simply hit their milestones as per.\nWe decided to take the genetics blood test that was offered — even though it cost a fortune and there was only a 30 per cent chance of discovering anything at all. \nIt was hard to put Sonia through it all. At barely two years old, her hypothyroidism meant she already needed to get her blood drawn every two months. And, being so small, they would never get her veins on the first attempt. Or second. Or third. \nIt always took about 45 minutes — pricking, holding her down and then pumping the blood out drop by drop. And nothing made my girl more upset than being held down.\nThis time was no different; I held her down while they drew three vials of blood, triple what her other test needed. \nThe results would come two months later. \nWe opted to take the results via a call, after a failed attempt to drive through insane pre-holiday traffic, since we were not really expecting to receive any serious news. \nThe clinic called, and my husband was the only one free to take it then; mothering duties meant I would only get an update after the fact.\nWe learned that night that Sonia has a very new and very rare condition called Rauch Steindl Syndrome. There are only 28 other known cases in the world. \nIt is caused by the malfunctioning of the gene responsible for growth. Regardless of what she eats, she doesn’t really grow. It causes hypotonia (low muscle mass), making her far weaker than her peers. There would be ensuing developmental delays. \nThe oldest known person with the condition is still alive at 58 years old and, as far as research has shown, the condition is not inherited. Listed as one of the symptoms is IUGR.\nAfter my husband shared the news with me, we sat silently together for what felt like a long time, not quite knowing what to make of things. The randomness of it all. \nSonia was the child we never quite intended to have — yet, in that moment, we also deeply understood that there was such providence in her being part of our family, rare condition and all.\nSonia means “wisdom”, and she is truly a product of a greater wisdom I am only beginning to discover. Her life and all that she is, feels so specific, so unique, so precise. \nSonia’s life has been a cycle of unveiling and understanding. And, given how little the world knows of her condition, we are forging where few have tread before. \nBut the one thing I do know is that rather than fear of what is to come, I simply feel deeply honoured to be part of her journey and I trust that my good God who lovingly knit her in my womb will see her — and us — through beyond each bend.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nRobyn Wong-Niamkongkit, 33, has a background in video production but now runs her own business selling Jesmonite crafts on her Instagram account @somethingbyrobyn_. After marrying her Thai husband, whom she met at university in Australia, the couple moved to Bangkok to start a family.

            "Article Body": "We met at a book launch event. Over dinner, we had a funny conversation about how cool Swedish people were. We joked about how we too wished we could start something like Spotify, or even Ikea. \nI asked her if we could keep in contact. She hesitated. \n“I have a boyfriend.” \nSeriously? That escalated quickly; the mere suggestion of keeping in touch had somehow leapt into being interpreted as a romantic invitation. \nI confess: I, a born and raised Singaporean, don’t quite understand how to make and keep friends in Singapore. \nIn my 20s, of all the problems I would face, I’d never expected loneliness to be one of the biggest ones. Of all the subjects we’d learnt in school, at least one should have explained how hard making and maintaining friendships would be in adulthood. \nI’d always dismissed it as a problem for older people. After all, a lifetime of sitcoms had taught us that being in your 20s is all about being mobile, sociable, and entirely able to make friends. \nBut week after week, I found myself staring down the barrel of an empty Sunday afternoon and wondering how I got there. \nDon’t get me wrong — I’m not uncomfortable being alone. I make it a point to date myself once a week, taking time to watch a movie alone or have a good meal on my own. \nBut at some point, I realised a need to feel emotionally connected with others. As former US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy wrote in his book Together, loneliness is “the absence of physical and emotional connection”. \nI longed for and craved that emotional connection. \nIn their adulthood, people commonly return to the friendships formed when they were younger, such as secondary school or university friends. \nIn most of these friend groups, I took on the role of initiator by default. But slowly, I got tired of coordinating times, and of figuring out where to go and what to do.\n“Sorry, I’m busy” became one of my most hated phrases, especially when there were no attempts to suggest alternative timings. I was putting in the effort, but I wasn’t seeing the same from my friends. It felt like I was being taken for granted.\nSome others would not commit until extremely late, perhaps three days before the meeting date. People who often do this can make you feel as if you are simply one social option out of many, and they are more concerned with gauging which one would be the most beneficial to them. \nI don’t blame them. For most working young adults, our jobs already take up so much time and energy — of course one would want to make the most of any free time, with the right people. \nSo I went on a mission to make new friends. \nIt started with attending social events like book clubs and mixers. Whenever I had a decent conversation with a new acquaintance, I would ask if I could keep in touch. \nMost of them were willing to keep in touch via Telegram handles. But then any text conversation would usually die, as there was no real reason to continue chatting outside of the event we had met at. Some would also ‘ghost’ me or not reply altogether. \nNone of them explicitly told me this — but I have a sneaking suspicion they’d assumed I was trying to either sell them something or date them. \nSingaporeans are a pragmatic people, much to both our benefit and our detriment. Here, new connections are often approached in a transactional manner. The receiving party’s default frame of mind seems to be: “What does this person want from me?” \nFor us, connections often aren’t relational — rarely are they the point in itself. \nConversations become about networking, instead of just sharing a good laugh, a funny story, and good company. \nWhenever we’re approached by a stranger, it’s hard for us to imagine that they have no agenda beyond just friendship. \nIs making and keeping friends simply impossible in Singapore? \nMay, 2022: While passing through my neighbourhood, I heard shouts and the familiar thwack of a ball against a wall. I followed the sounds to the soccer court, where a handful of youths were playing. \nEmbarrassed, I asked if I could join them. It was awkward, and I was aware: Here I was, a 26-year-old man, attempting to join a group of 13- to 16-year-olds. \nMuch to my relief, these boys kindly and gladly welcomed me. \nOver the past 18 months, we’ve become more than just players sharing a court. They share their troubles in school with me. I share my troubles about work and dating with them. \nJust like that, in the most unexpected of places, I found — dare I say it — friends. \nWhat makes upkeep of this connection easy is that there are no elaborate efforts to try and find common timeslots. You just appear, and play. \nNow, when I meet someone new and ask to exchange contact info, I quickly add: “I’m not trying to date you.” \nThis clarity appears to help. (I’ve not been rejected yet, at least.) \nBut perhaps the most important of my takeaways is to be intentional with friends, both old and new. \nTo keep in touch with people, we first need to know who we want to keep in touch with. \nOne exercise I found helpful was the making of a friendship map — something I lifted from We Need To Hang Out by Billy Baker. \nFor this, Baker uses Dunbar’s Number — anthropologist Robin Dunbar’s theory that 150 is the typical number of people we can keep track of and consider part of our ongoing social network at any one time.\nWhat’s more interesting are the numbers in between: Dunbar estimates that we would have about five close friends, 15 we would consider family, 50 we would see as part of our clan, and the remaining 80 as part of our tribe. \nBaker also relies on the internal question: “Would you want to ask this person out for coffee if you randomly bumped into them?” If the answer is no, or “it’d be awkward”, it’s likely that they aren’t someone you would consider a friend. \nI like to think friendships are like clothes. \nDifferent clothes are good for different seasons. You can’t change the season to fit the clothes you wear. Instead, it’s more ideal that you wear clothes that fit the season. \nThere are the tough seasons, where all you want each weekend is friends to have fun with so you can forget about work or whatever struggles you’re facing during the week. \nThen there are the seasons where you have a little more time. During these periods, actively nurturing my friendships, rather than leaving them to chance, reminds me of what makes life meaningful. \nBut, regardless of weather, clothes can and will spoil. When that happens, you need to decide whether those friendships are still fit for purpose. \nOften, though, such friendships can be worth a mend. Try something new with your friend — play a sport unfamiliar to you both, explore a new country, or embark on a new adventure together. \nThe important thing is to do something. Take action. Chances are, if you are thinking of a friend, they’re probably also thinking of you. \nIt’s not just because your friends are worth it. \nIt’s because you, too, are worth hanging out with.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nJohn Lim speaks on creating happier workplaces for millennials and is the author of the book Take Heart: Thriving in the Emotional Wilderness.

            "Article Body": "A good dog never growls at its owners. A good marriage means few arguments. A good business is one that is profitable and growing.\nThese seemed like wise adages, or so I once thought.\nOn one particular Monday in September, I went into the office, sat each of my employees down one-by-one, and told them that I was letting them go — not due to any fault of theirs, or because of the company’s finances.\nIt was hard to explain, but I needed to upend the life that I had been constructing for the past decade, even if – by most metrics – it was doing fine.\nI was fortunate enough to have a comfortable childhood, and parents who were supportive of all my pursuits.\nThroughout my growing years, they nurtured me the best way they knew how, by building up my confidence, telling me they were proud of me, and proclaiming me to be a natural leader.\nPerhaps that was what gave me the foolhardiness to plunge into starting up a new video production business after graduating from university in 2012.\nI had studied video production, and I had no doubt that I could make a living from the skills I had at the time.\nMoreover, my mother had been diagnosed with cancer, and this was the best way to maximise the time I spent with her.\nIn 2013, my then girlfriend joined me, and over the next decade, we slowly expanded the company to a peak of 15.\nTogether with our team, we worked on over 400 projects for 120 clients to create corporate videos and other short-form content. We had a solid stable of clients, which enabled us to ride the waves of different challenges, including Covid-19.\nIn the eyes of many people, we were a company that was doing fine.\nJust like how the pandemic was a time for many to reflect deeply on their lives, it was the same for us as well.\nAs we took a pause and relooked at what we were doing, it soon became apparent that our “good” business was perhaps not so good for us.\nRunning a new company is easy, insofar as the goals are straightforward — get more portfolio, clients and staff members. Rinse and repeat.\nIt’s hectic, and the breakneck pace means that you never stop and reflect on what you’re doing.\nBut when a company matures, you cannot keep doing the same. The world around you is always changing. The conditions that make you profitable today won’t exist tomorrow. The challenges you face may not be part of a cycle, but a permanent, structural change.\nBeing in the creative space, our strongest asset will always be people and if I wanted to grow the company, or even just survive, I needed to invest time and energy into management, culture, and establishing a deeper vision for the business.\nBut these were not areas that I was good at, and having never worked for someone else before, I had no reference point. Plus, I had been told that I was not a natural business leader.\nPerhaps the idea of such a leader does not exist at all, but the reality was that I did not want to commit to doing what was needed to take my company further.\nWhat I enjoyed about my work at the production house is getting to listen to the stories of people from all walks of life, and having intimate access to the inner workings of various organisations that I work with.\nTo me, my fulfilment did not come from running a business in itself. If I were to commit to the task of growing the company, then I would just be shackling myself to the job, and missing the point of being my own boss.\nThat was back in 2020. It took me close to three years to take the next steps, which was letting go of all my employees (except my wife, of course) and moving into a tiny office space, turning back the clock on a decade of work.\nPerhaps I could have made the change faster if I had some deep creative hunger to fulfil. Truth is, we were ok. I wasn’t exceptionally unhappy. Our revenues were not a disaster.\nThe bigger problem was that I had tied my identity to being a business owner, and I was afraid to let go of that. I couldn’t envision what an alternate life would look like, and so I kept putting off what needed to be done.\nBut then I looked around myself and realised that many things that I hold to be self-evident truths are simply false once I thought harder about them.\nA good dog never growls at its owners? Our adopted Singapore Special frequently growls at us, simply because he didn’t grow up learning any other way to communicate, but he’s not aggressive by any measure.\nA good marriage means few arguments? My wife and I argue all the time, but working through disagreements helps us understand each other better. A marriage with no arguments is worse if both sides are hiding their feelings to avoid conflict.\nIf I could see that these truisms were not what they appeared to be, then why am I hung up on the idea that a good business is simply one that is profitable and growing? Why could I not recognise that it is possible to have a profitable company, and also that I needed to give it up?\nWhat finally helped me to make the decision was realising that running the business was sapping my emotional energy, which is much harder to regain than physical energy.\nMy wife and I had no hobbies, our social circles were shrinking, and even finding the energy to watch a new television show often felt like a daunting prospect.\nIronically, even though we worked together, we never felt like we had enough time for each other because we were always in business mode.\nA year after I started the business, my mother passed away.\nThroughout her illness, I saw how having money enabled us to maximise her treatment options and keep her comfortable. That was the lesson I took away then, but a decade later, I realise that the more important lesson is to not waste time living a life that is just okay.\nMy mother died at just 56 years old; any of us could go tomorrow. If we have the privilege to do so, we owe it to ourselves to thrive, and not just survive.\nThere are so many more places to go, people to meet and things to try. Maybe I could shine in a different industry. Maybe I might do better as an employee than as a boss. Maybe I might produce the best work of my life working with my wife. Maybe I was wrong about it all, and will start hiring people again.\nThe exploration, and not the conclusion, is the main point.\nAs we approach 2024, I will continue to have doubts about my course of action, but my decision has unshackled my creative energies and given me the drive to do my best for projects that I feel passionate for.\nI am also energised at the opportunity to work even more closely with my work and life partner, and I am thankful for the clients who continue to have faith in us and our ability to produce quality videos, even as we evolve as a company.\nMost of all, I am no longer at the crossroads, and am excited to be back at the trailhead, knowing that I have the power to redefine my journey along the way.\nThere is value in running companies that eschew the pursuit of growth, in favour of building a path that is mentally and emotionally sustainable.\nThere is value in living a life where “luxury” comes from the peace of mind in knowing that you have crafted your life consciously and deliberately, even if it doesn’t turn out as planned.\nMost of all, there is value in searching for a way to thrive, and not just do ok. It’s safe in the boat, but if it isn’t sailing where you want to go, then you might be better off jumping into the water and swimming.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nJeremy Oh, 36, is the founder and director of video production house OHBOY!

            "Article Body": "I was out shopping a few weeks ago when a mother of two approached me to tell me how she admired my courage for talking about dating. \nShe had recognised me from the launch of my first graphic novel How to Date a Dozen Men at Kinokuniya.\nAs she looked at me with hopeful eyes, I wondered if I should tell her my hidden truth – that I’m actually not brave at all, and that I still get cold feet when I think about reading new reviews about my book.\nInstead, I replied jokingly about how if someone like me could write a book about dating, anyone could do it too.\nI knew art was my thing as I grew up, even before I knew how to make friends at the playground. If I wasn’t watching cartoons like Teen Titans or Winx Club as a kid, I was making things out of papier mache and glue like that guy on the children’s TV series Art Attack. \nI was also inspired by one of my best friends in primary school, who would draw comics about her original characters on cheap printer paper and staple them together to create issues. She would then give them to me.\nEncouraged by her efforts, I tried making my own comics too. Yet, I couldn’t help comparing my rough scribblings with the smooth curves that my best friend drew.\nThis might be when the imposter syndrome began creeping into my life. \nI remember being so fixated on “fixing” my artwork that I never managed to complete a whole issue.\nEventually, I stopped drawing as I got busier in secondary school, but I was still attracted to the world of comics. \nThere was something empowering about how the heroines in DC Comics always knew and did what was right, and so I started collecting comic books and little figurines of them.\nAt the time, I also heard about the Singapore Comic Con, which is one of the leading events here for comic lovers like me.\nI knew this was something I absolutely had to attend. I remember my heart pounding in my chest when I met so many talented and passionate artists and cosplayers. It felt like the most magical place on Earth – even better than Disneyland.\nThat motivated me to get my creative juices going again. \nBecause my best friend had a drawing tablet, I immediately begged her to teach me how to use it over the school holidays. I got hooked the moment I made my first brush stroke in years.\nEventually, I bought my own drawing tablet and I would draw almost every day. \nTo sharpen my skills, I’d borrow books from the library and watch art tutorials on YouTube.\nDespite this, I was allergic to any praise that came my way.\nWhen some of my friends said that I was talented, I’d immediately brush aside their compliments and insist that anyone could do it with sheer discipline, determination, and lots of free time. \nI didn’t feel like I deserved compliments for something I felt I didn’t have or earn.\nWhile completing my communications degree, I did everything I could to essentially learn about comics without actually majoring in it. \nI took classes about graphic novels, did an independent study on feminism in comic books, and even wrote a final year thesis about superhero comics.\nDuring a semester abroad, I jumped at the chance to visit Wondercon in the US, excited to experience an American version of the Singapore Comic Con. There, I met so many writers and artists, and by some stroke of luck, I was invited to the DC Comics headquarters in Burbank California. \nI was surrounded by my heroes – people who made my childhood and youth full of colour and life. I thought they were like celebrities who were far out of my reach, but meeting them made me realise that they were just regular people who somehow had shared the same passion with me.\nFor the first time, it felt like it was possible to actually be a comic book artist.\nEventually, I began drawing and selling my own designs. I started with stickers, charms, prints, and even an annual calendar of my favourite DC Comics characters. Finally, in 2018, I gathered enough courage to set up my own booth at the Singapore Comic Con.\nEven then, I still felt insecure if my art was good enough to make a career out of it. I needed a platform to showcase my work to the world, and prove my insecurities wrong. \nThe turning point came when I heard about the Work in Progress programme at the convention. This was an initiative to help aspiring artists get published, which felt like the perfect opportunity for aspiring artists like me to meet publishers and get feedback for my work. \nI first entered the contest in 2020. I survived on caffeine and Salonpas for three weeks while I slogged on my entry, only to miss the chance to meet the publishers because I was too busy preparing for my Comic Con booth.\nWhen the contest came back in 2021, I was busy working on my own projects and didn’t have time to work on a full submission. \nIt was at this time that I hatched the idea to come up with an illustrated book about all the guys I’d met through the matchmaking service I’d signed up for. \nTruth be told, I picked this theme because it was the easiest thing I could think of, and I didn’t think that I would be successfully shortlisted for the Comic Con initiative.  \nSomehow, my book became a finalist and the publisher Epigram decided to pick it up! After 18 months of struggling with the book and working through multiple identity crises as I dissected my own psyche, it was finally published.\nEven then, imposter syndrome struck me again because I remember being terrified of the reviews.\nMy art style was simple, unlike the elaborate drawings with intricate details that I’ve seen in manga and western comics. Will people like my book? Will they think my art is too childish?\nWill they think I’m too picky, too confident, or too geeky to find a partner? What if one of the dates in the book recognised me?\nWhat if I was cancelled?\nWhenever a new review came up, I got my friends to read them first before I even dared to take a glance. So, when readers started telling me how much the book resonated with them, I was taken by surprise.\nThe book turned out to be a bestseller at Kinokuniya in the comics category for two whole weeks. The Straits Times called it “a charmingly relatable dive into the woes of modern dating” and gave me a five-star review.\nWhat struck me most from this experience was the small interactions with readers. For example, I once received a heartwarming note from a reader that said “You are deserving of love too”.\nI realised that this is why I make art, and it is to connect with people.\nThat is why I still continue to participate in art events where I get to meet people, because it constantly reminds me that I’m part of something which can inspire others to keep chasing their dreams.\nAs such, I’m an exhibitor at the Singapore Comic Con this year once more.\nBut when I heard that the phrase “Make It Here” was the theme for this year’s Singapore Media Festival, which the Comic Con is a part of, I couldn’t help feeling that same niggling feelings of self-doubt.\nI wondered: Could I even say if I’d “made it” yet?\nOver the years, I still have yet to completely put aside my imposter syndrome, which I have accepted will always loom over me.\nWhen I look back at my old art, for example, I still cringe at my feeble attempts at drawing human anatomy. But I have since learnt to take such feelings in my stride by being proud of what I’ve achieved.\nI still wonder if being an artist is truly my calling, but I always think back to a moment in 2022 when I met one of my favourite comic artists Mitch Gerads at the Singapore Comic Con a few years ago while donning the costume of the iconic Wonder Woman. \nHe is an acclaimed illustrator for DC Comics, and I had purchased a piece of art from him that showed a girl looking at a framed picture of Wonder Woman while emulating her power pose. \nSerendipitously, a little girl came up to me for a photo, eyes sparkling and also pulling off the power pose.\nThis wasn’t just life imitating art, but it was his artwork actually coming to life in this chance encounter. \nI knew from then on that I wanted to create special moments like this too through my art.\nBecause as long as I continue creating meaningful art for people and sharing them, I think I’m going to be okay.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nSamara Gan, 27, is a self-employed comic artist and the author of the graphic novel How to Date a Dozen Men.

            "Article Body": "If you looked up the phrase \"going hard\" on Urban Dictionary, you'd probably find a picture of my face.\nAt age 19, before I had even officially received my diploma, I started working my first full-time job in advertising while doing my degree part-time. My days were spent working insane hours, going to class, partying late into the night, taking naps and hitting the gym, before going to work and beginning the cycle all over again. \nUnsurprisingly for someone who can't sit still, I love sports. Boxing, bouldering, surfing, diving, hiking — if it doesn’t involve a racquet, I’m into it. \nBut most of all, I love football — not just for the technicality and complexity of the game, but also the camaraderie. My teammates and I have made promises that we would play together until we’re in our 60s. \nIn order to improve and play injury-free for longer, I invested in personal training sessions followed my trainer's online programme for years. You’d usually see me in the gym for three to six hours a week. The difference my efforts made were undeniable: After a few months on this regime, I was hitting personal bests on every lift. \nThen, it came to October this year. After over 13 years of non-stop hustling, I was finally on sabbatical from work.\nI was at my strongest and healthiest. My mental health was the best it's been in years. To top it all off, I was now married to my dream guy! \nAll the pieces of my life had finally fallen into place. I was happy; more importantly, I was hopeful for what I thought to be a bright future ahead. \nI was walking home after football one day, and, without any warning, my right knee just buckled. Right away, I knew something was deeply, chillingly wrong.\nAs I lay still in an MRI scanner, the worst-case scenario in my mind was a torn medial collateral ligament (MCL) — a short-term problem that can typically be fixed with surgery and diligent rehabilitation. But days later, when I hobbled into the doctor's office to receive my results and saw the concern in his kind eyes, I knew I was in for a rough ride. \nBeing diagnosed with bilateral patellofemoral osteoarthritis at age 32 is pretty damning. Most people with this condition are over the age of 50, and the usual prognosis would be to do a double knee replacement surgery and to give up contact sports. \nAfter my consultation, I sat in the car and cried for a long while. I’m too young to switch out contact sports for swimming! I’m too young for osteoarthritis!\nI’ve been 165 cm tall since I was 12 years old. At my lightest, I was 46 kg and at my heaviest, I was 75 kg. Pretty drastic, I know.\nI grew up in the era of Keira Knightley and Kate Moss, but my genetical make-up is more \"Trim and Fit Club\". Fellow millennials will know TAF Club really meant FAT Club, where we were taught that if we wanted to lose weight, we had to eat less and run more. \nThe more I ran in school, the more I realised I could actually run pretty fast. In a way, I was happily surprised: My body was good at something! \nI started receiving compliments on my weight loss. This spurred me to keep piling on the runs, always going faster and longer — all while subsisting on a diet of salads. \nBy the time I was 16, I was running an average of 10 to 20 km a day, with no proper training, footwear, recovery or nutrition. \nOne day, 3 km into a casual jog, my knees buckled. Afraid to find out what it meant, I avoided seeing a doctor and also stopped running altogether. \nThat was the point at which the cartilage in my knees begun to degrade. And I wouldn’t find out for another decade.\nI am proof that body dysmorphia and eating disorders aren’t just mental health conditions. They also have a long-lasting, possibly permanent impact on our physical health. \nUpon getting diagnosed, I had only one goal in mind: To get back onto the football pitch as soon as humanly possible.\nWithin a week, I’d completed a bilateral arthroscopic debridement, chondroplasty and meniscus repair with the help of my doctor, Dr Gurpal Singh. \nBy the second day I was doing pull-ups and had walked over 1300 steps, feeling very proud of myself for being able to move and shower independently. \nOn the third day, in the midst of making the arduous preparations now required for me to undertake a simple shower, it suddenly hit me that I was just at the starting line, and the road to rebuilding my strength and stamina from scratch is a long one. \nI cried again.\nIt took me a while to process and embrace the full spectrum of my feelings. Hours in therapy has enabled me to acknowledge the beauty of being human: We are complex and messy. The sooner we learn to be comfortable with being uncomfortable, the more wholeheartedly we can live.\nA week after my operation, a vase I'd ordered for a friend arrived — coincidentally enough, with its legs broken. I decided to order a separate Kintsugi set and attempt to fix the vase on my own. \nIt’s messy and it’s not perfect — but it holds up, and my friend loves it. \nFor me, this was an encouraging reminder that perfection is overrated, and that while my body may never be back at 100 per cent, a new beauty can emerge from the mess. \nI may not be able to play three matches in a row ever again, but I don’t have to give up on football, and total knee replacement is not inevitable. \nI’ve started sessions at Physio Circle. Their philosophy is “No last game”, which I've taken to heart. I recently managed my first push-ups in nearly a month, and I’m once again looking forward to the future. \nSlowing down has also given me the chance to finally start the podcast that's been on my to-do list for years now, titled Naked.Graced, where I'm excited to share my ugly, uncomfortable, authentic stories that will hopefully resonate with my fellow human beings. \nI have no idea what the future holds, but I know that it’s going to be worth it.\n \nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nGrace Ke, 32, is an aspiring podcaster who founded her mental health podcast Naked.Graced."

            "Article Body": "Being a mother is a balancing act — but for a single mother, that challenge gets multiplied by a few hundred times.\nWhen my role as a homemaker ended upon separating from my ex-husband a few years back, I knew I had to step up and become the primary provider for my three children. As a mother, you'll do anything for your kids. I considered various options, like taking a full-time desk job, but I knew it would be tough to balance such work and my children.\nThat’s why, armed with a driver’s licence and a knack for driving, I decided to take up delivery as a job. I found a position at a delivery firm, but that unfortunately folded towards the end of 2021. The abrupt closure left me jobless once again, frustrated about how I would now provide for my kids.\nIn my time of turmoil, a close friend suggested that I try out Lalamove.\nI was initially sceptical, but upon learning about the company’s offer of lower car rental rates, 25 per cent fuel discounts and weekly pay-outs, I decided to jump on it. At that point, what did I have to lose?\nIt also made sense to work in a job that kept me behind the wheel while giving me some flexibility.\nI rented a car and went through the onboarding and training, which was all done online and was much easier to follow than I’d expected. After two days, I was ready to hit the roads as a Lalamove driver-partner.\nI told myself: “Let’s just try it for a month.”\nAfter just three weeks, I realised the job’s potential to secure my family's financial needs — and I haven't looked back since.\nOf my three children, I take care of two under my custody while continuing to provide maintenance for my first. My younger ones — a lively six-year-old son and an adorable three-year-old daughter — fill my life with immense joy and playfulness.\nWhile my job offers plenty of flexibility, I still follow a well-kept routine by starting work at 9.30am or 10am after finishing my morning errands, which include sending my kids to kindergarten and childcare.\nI buy food from hawker centres and usually have lunch in the vehicle while searching and waiting for my next customer.\nBecause I work six days a week, I cherish every moment with my children and prioritise the rest of my time for them. Be it a trip to the playground or cosy movie nights at home, the quality time we have together is extremely precious to me.\nIn 2018, my son was diagnosed with a flesh-eating bacteria known as Group A streptococcus. What started as a mark as small as a mosquito bite turned into a lifelong health commitment.\nMy son’s health crisis involved weeks in the hospital, some of which were spent in the intensive care unit. This year, he went through a below-knee amputation, learning to walk with his new prosthetic leg while undergoing regular physiotherapy.\nMy child’s welfare became my top priority during this time, and I was determined to find a way to balance work and care for him. I started bringing him along on my deliveries when needed, ensuring he was occupied with books and toys.\nInterestingly, customers at pickup points almost never questioned his presence. Instead, they would often engage with him, making us feel welcomed and supported.\nThere were days when my son was in pain and I couldn't fulfil a full seven-hour shift, but the relief of being able to be there for him while at work was priceless. Being able to take days off and plan my schedule around deliveries is something I couldn't have achieved in other lines of work such as a nine-to-five.\nWhile driving is my passion, I genuinely do enjoy the delivery process as well.\nI'm all about getting things done, ticking off the boxes on checklists in my head, no matter if they are chores, errands or deliveries.\nThe people I encounter on the job make it an enriching one as well. I have fond memories of frequenting a fruit stall, picking up durians and mangosteens for eager customers. The stall owners relished working with me, sharing cheerful banters, doing small talk, and asking about my well-being as they entrusted me with their deliveries.\nI find that there is something profoundly heartwarming about the act of bringing people the things they need, right to their doorstep. I'm not just delivering packages; I'm delivering sustenance for Singaporeans, one package at a time.\nOf course, there are challenging days in my delivery journey where frustration takes hold — but even these are valuable moments that have significantly enhanced my sense of empathy.\nWe are all humans, and we all have our rough days where we aren’t at our best. These experiences have taught me to extend patience and empathy to people I meet each day, even if I may only encounter them for a moment.\nBeing a present mother remains extremely important to me. Having lost my own mother a few years ago, I vowed to be there for my children in their times of need. I want them to feel secure and supported as they navigate the whirlwind of life and grow into their own persons.\nIn this, the little things are so important: For example, I deeply cherish the moments when I can step into my kitchen, don my apron, and whip up a home-cooked meal. Two or three times a week, I become both the delivery hero and the family chef.\nDespite the double standards and stigma that remain prevalent for single mothers like me, we find a way to reach a new level of resilience and strength every day. We embrace our roles as both providers and caregivers, serving as both father and mother to our children.\nWe're in it for the long drive, fuelled by our children’s smiles to keep powering along.\nThe flexibility and financial stability of driving with Lalamove has empowered me to secure a steady livelihood for my children. I count it not only a personal victory for me, but a testament to the incredible capabilities of single mothers everywhere.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nJuliana Jorimi, 33, is a driver-partner at Lalamove."

            "Article Body": "When I landed my first official job as a content producer, I was over the moon. After all, it gave me the chance to be part of the exciting media scene. Or so I thought.\nHaving worked as a waitress and a cashier after ‘O’ Levels – jobs in which I had enjoyed daily interactions with many people — I quickly realised that life as a producer can be quite solitary. I also came to feel that my main concern was not the story I was working on, but rather how quickly I could churn out the work, and the number of viewers the story could garner.\nAfter close to five months of battling an overwhelming sense of isolation and self-doubt, I pivoted to a customer service job at OCBC at the age of 21.\nMy friends who I had gone to school with were mystified. We had all worked hard to earn our media diplomas. They knew the pains that can come with long hours in service work, which also requires one to tolerate and manage angry and impatient customers at times.\nCustomer service, to them, wasn’t just a pivot — it was a step down.\nBut I knew the impact that good customer service could create. I still recall times when my parents were elated after bank staff helped them resolve their passbook issues. Even in a matter as small as this, helpful customer service officers were able to turn their day around.\nAnd so, even as my friends expressed scepticism, my parents wholly supported the move. They understood that I am a ‘people person’ at heart — being able to connect with others is my strength, and having opportunities to do this would be the best way for me to feel fulfilled in any job.\nThis is why I have stayed in customer service for eight years, with no intention of leaving.\nYou’re probably wondering: Isn’t it tiring to have to face unreasonable customers day after day?\nBased on my experience, the fact is: Yes, you will face at least one such customer every day.\nIt’s true, these encounters are no fun — but what I have realised over the years is that even the unhappiest of customers is not unhappy with you. Rather, they are not pleased with what they have experienced.\nOften, what an angry customer wants most is just to be heard, and to have someone understand their plight.\nAs a customer service officer, you have a chance to turn things around for them. They respond to you if you are patient and compassionate.\nNo lie — sometimes customers can fly into a fit of rage and even shout at you. But that makes me even more determined to try to find a solution. You never know what someone is facing and how you make a difference.\nRecently, an elderly lady walked in. My colleagues and I could tell right away she was troubled.\nAfter speaking with her, I learnt that her husband had died several months ago of a heart attack, leaving behind debt of which she had been unaware. Late fees piled up surrounding an instalment plan for an insurance policy. Because the bill had gone unpaid, the amount owed had ballooned to around S$10,000.\nAs she talked about her late husband, tears began to fall from her eyes, and my heart went out to her. I could not help but think of my grandmother, who experienced similar feelings of loss and grief when my grandfather passed on a decade ago. I was determined to help this customer.\nWorking with various colleagues in different business units, we managed to get approval to expedite a waiver for her, significantly whittling down the amount she owed. We also worked to review the insurance policy with her, a process that revealed to her where a payout was rightfully owed to her.\nBut most importantly, she found someone who was willing to listen — someone with whom she could share her precious memories of her late husband.\nI look back on her case with fondness and pride. Even now, it’s a reminder to my colleagues and myself that we can go above and beyond what we think we are capable of.\nWhile many of my peers tend to move from job to job, never staying more than a few years in a role, cases like these keep me passionate about the service line because they enable me to see how my actions have a tangible impact.\nYes, I have to work retail hours, on weekends and on-site — requirements that are not especially popular with those in my generation. For this reason, among others, many industries find it difficult to hire and retain customer service staff.\nHowever, the good experiences definitely tide me through tough times.\nLittle things warm my heart, like customers dropping into the branch just to say “Hello Gina”. Although we are not ‘friends’, we have a bond nonetheless. I get the sense that my customers know they can rely upon a personal connection in transactions that can otherwise feel impersonal, especially in an increasingly digital world.\nAlthough it is not the most glamorous job, for me, there is much personal achievement and fulfilment to be found in a role focused on helping people.\nMy friends and family frequently remark on how I am thriving in this line. My loved ones have learned not to be quick to judge my career choices, but rather to prioritise my happiness.\nContrary to popular belief, there is also career progression in this line. At the bank where I work, I have seen many colleagues transition to different service roles, keeping things fresh and exciting for them.\nTo my fellow young adults who are looking to kickstart or reinvigorate their careers, do not dismiss customer service as an option — or, indeed, any other lines of work that we may often overlook as ‘less than’.\nThe key is to find a role that allows you to play to your strengths, and let that be your pathway to true fulfilment.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:"

The rush before going on stage, the bright lights, and the applause weren’t just moments; they were what defined my younger years.\nAt the age of 18, I did a musical called Fame, which turned out to be one of the most unforgettable productions I have ever been a part of. It was my first time taking on a lead role where I had to act, sing and dance live in front of an audience.\nThe rehearsals were gruelling, going for six hours at a time up to four times a week, but I enjoyed the camaraderie with the cast and crew. Working with different actors, musicians and dancers to deliver an exceptional performance brought me tremendous joy and fulfilment.  \nLater in my teenhood, I started to wonder about the possibility of pursuing a career doing what I love, but I was apprehensive about going into theatre full-time as I wasn’t sure if my interests would change down the road.\nWhile I was still trying to figure out what I wanted to do, I chanced upon the Diploma in Integrated Events Management course offered by Republic Polytechnic. From a tender age, I would volunteer to help plan and execute events at school and at home, including class fundraisers, sports day, birthday parties and even weddings.  \nIt never felt like a chore as I derived immense joy and satisfaction seeing how pleased my family and friends were with how well the events turned out.\nAlthough the diploma wasn’t directly related to theatre, it resonated with me nonetheless. I felt that the course could potentially provide an avenue to integrate my passion for the arts into a broader framework.\nAs I delved deeper into the course, I began to notice parallels between theatre and events management.\nIn theatre, I was trained to be adept at improvisation so as to respond to unexpected situations that can occur during a performance. This ability to think on my feet and be resourceful proved useful when I was learning how to plan large-scale events — particularly, for example, in moments where clients would spring last-minute requests on us, expecting us to deliver.\nUpon entering the world of Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions (MICE), it became clear to me that MICE, like theatre, takes an entire village to pull off. From those who set the vision for the event, to the marketing teams that spread the word to the right people, and the tech experts who enable everything to run smoothly, every role is crucial.\nThere are times when things can get hectic, especially when I have to manage multiple events simultaneously, but the feeling of pride and accomplishment I get when the event wraps up successfully makes it all worthwhile.\nIt reminds me of the long hours I used to spend at theatre rehearsals, culminating in enthusiastic applause from audiences. It soon became clear to me that when you are doing something you love, you are more than willing to put in the hours to ensure everything turns out perfect.\nWhile applause from a crowd is rarely in the cards for coordinators, the satisfaction of seeing an event come together is akin to receiving a standing ovation on opening night.\nWhile highly fulfilling, the job is not without its challenges.\nAfter more than seven years in the industry, I have encountered my fair share of roadblocks and obstacles, many of which I am grateful for as they have made me step out of my comfort zone.\nThe recent pandemic for one, provided my team and I the chance to pivot and adapt to the changing nature of conferences. For a client’s new product launch, we learnt how to organise our first hybrid event with an international audience. Due to Covid restrictions, we could only have about 120 people attend the physical event here in Singapore, while another 200 attended virtually from Shenzhen, China.\nFiguring out how to keep guests engaged while abiding by safe distancing protocols was a challenge, but our hard work paid off: Our clients were very pleased with the turnout, and our delegates were also very impressed by how smoothly the event went.\nAnother aspect of my job I really appreciate is being able to cross paths with professionals from all walks of life, from logistics experts and hospitality professionals to tech specialists and artists. Through my work, I have met people from all over the world — Canada, Austria, Japan and more. This has provided me valuable learning opportunities and expanded my perspectives.\nOne of the most impactful memories of my MICE career was at a pharmaceutical conference I helped organise here in Singapore.\nWitnessing some of the world’s brightest minds come together to share about their game-changing innovations, each of which had the potential to save countless lives, I was struck by the realisation that this was only possible because of the work my team and I had poured into the event.\nThis was just one of many moments that motivate me to keep making a meaningful difference through my work.\nNo two events are the same, much like no two theatre performances are the same. Each event, like each stage performance, has its own unique story, challenges and triumphs.\nFinding a career that is enjoyable and fulfilling isn’t easy, but I’ve learnt that unexpected fields can offer the best of both worlds.\nWhatever journey you choose, the friendships forged along the way also make it a lot more meaningful – some of the people I crossed paths with during my theatre days remain some of my closest friends today.\nIf I could somehow send a message to my younger self who was torn between my dreams and reality, I’d say this: Life has a way of surprising you. Keep an open mind, embrace every opportunity, and you might find a path that not only aligns with your passion, but also offers a world of experiences you never imagined.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nAsh Abdullah, 29, is a project manager and event organiser at International Conference Services."

            "Article Body": "I remember being a “victim” of the 5.5-day work week as a student in the late 1990s.\nInstead of the five-day work week that officially began in the civil service in 2004, the norm at the time was to work for an additional half a day over the weekends.\nLike most Singaporeans, my parents had work to attend to every Saturday morning, and this expectation trickled down to school as well.\nEven at the age of nine, I vividly recall my bitterness at missing the Saturday morning cartoons that played on TV, because for a year in primary school, my stern and hardworking Chinese teacher decided the whole class needed to come back for supplementary classes.\nIn a way, my life still has not changed much.\nAlthough society moved to a five-day work week by the time my friends and I entered the workforce, most of us usually end up working “unofficially” on weekends. \nIt’s almost impossible to arrange to meet my best friend, who works in insurance, on weekend mornings, as she always has client appointments at that time. \nThe teachers I know often spend their weekends poring over lesson plans too in that timeframe. And if you count the hours, for those who work desk-bound jobs, a work-free weekend would usually mean burning through late nights on weekdays.\nSo now that the talk of a four-day work week has surfaced, I am sceptical of how it would work in Singapore. \nIn July 2021, Manpower Minister Tan See Leng opened the doors to the four-day work week by saying that any employer who wishes to implement it for their employees is allowed to since there are no legal obstacles.\nIn 2022, researchers in Britain launched a trial in which 61 organisations and about 2,900 workers voluntarily adopted truncated work weeks, and found that at the conclusion of the experiment, most companies did not want to go back to the five-day standard.\nRecently, I’ve seen job ads of some companies here in Singapore dangling such carrots in front of prospective jobseekers, promising better work-life balance with shorter working hours and flexible work arrangements.\nMaybe I’m just inefficient, but can most of us really complete all our tasks in four days?  \nFor one, as a freelance writer, I already determine the hours and days that I work. And it so happens that I find myself working on weekends sometimes. \nDon’t get me wrong: Just the thought of a shorter work week makes me happy. It is the exact feeling people get when they anticipate a long weekend. \nThis is a list of things I would probably do in that free time:\nAnd if a four-day work week really does become a reality, hopefully my friends and family members would also share the same schedule so that we could meet up more often.\nAt this point, you might be thinking that my plans seem frivolous. I admit that they definitely do not sound like the most productive way to spend time.\nI’m slightly sheepish to say that at this moment, I have no plans to go for a SkillsFuture course to upgrade myself, though I recognise that lifelong learning does make a difference to boost employability.\nIf I spent fewer days in the office, would I use my free time on personal and career development? I’m not sure if I will.\nBut I am quite sure that, at least from a psychological perspective, I would feel more relaxed and content. After all, there is research that shows that people who are less stressed are better at their jobs.\nBesides that, why does it always need to boil down to productivity?\nI can imagine the concerns about manpower shortages and logistics nightmares with a four-day work week. I already hear warnings about how the costs would be passed on to consumers.\nI was horrified to read about the 9-9-6 (9am to 9pm, six days a week) culture in tech companies in China recently. \nCould the “lying flat” movement in China – which is described as people opting out of the culture of overwork and consumerism – be a result of this reality?\nChina is also facing rising youth unemployment. In June, its unemployment rate in June was a record-breaking 21.3 per cent, and the country stopped publishing the statistic in August.\nFor a moment, I even considered myself lucky that I was far away from such a work culture.\nBut I was recently shocked to hear the announcement that preschools in Singapore will scrap the requirement for a six-day work week and align with the five-day work week normal from Jan 1, 2025.\nOne reason for the change, other than the fact that most parents don’t need the Saturday service, is that it could promote better working conditions and attract more people to the industry.\nAs pointed out in a recent Big Read by TODAY, experts said the real issue is the heavy workload, which makes it seemingly impossible to cram all our tasks into four days.\nBut I believe a change is near, that is if my conversations with my friends are any indication.\nThey stay in their jobs, not solely because of passion or ambition, but because the job pays them well enough to sustain their wants and needs. And this includes paying for that plane ticket to get away from work.\nAt this point, I know that some might scoff at the lack of drive or hunger at work, and how it used to be like “back in the day”. \nBut there is no shame if vacations are your main motivation for working. Wanting a break from work should not be seen as laziness either. \nIn many countries, many young people are no longer convinced that slogging away is the only route to happiness, but they also want to be able to afford their vacations. \nIn Singapore, many people my age probably feel the same too. We don’t need to be working to the bone, but we want to be more efficient and not be penalised for completing our work earlier so that we can have more time for ourselves.\nA survey of Singapore youths between 18 and 35 last year showed that two-thirds of respondents wanted a four-day work week, even if it meant working longer hours each day.\nAlso significant was the fact that about 70 per cent also felt that it was possible to achieve their long-term goals without working beyond traditional office hours. \nHopefully, all of these means that managing to fulfil one’s task in four days – instead of five – would look good on a resume or performance appraisal. \nAnecdotally, however, the most efficient and effective workers are often the most overworked, because they are often “rewarded” with extra work instead. \nTo me, changing such mindsets will need well-defined job scopes, firm deadlines, and respect for others’ working hours – we need to leave the people on leave alone. \nFor managers, it means recognising that just because a worker completed their task early, they shouldn’t be saddled with more.\nWhich leads me to my next point: A shorter work week could really encourage us to be more efficient. \nThis is coming from me, a self-professed procrastinator who always seems to find speed and inspiration when deadlines are approaching.\nWorking from home has shown us that there are many inefficiencies involved when working in an office. \nAs someone who has worked briefly in a very “old-school” workplace, I can think of some examples: long meetings, the prep that goes behind these long meetings, and long coffee breaks (I’m guilty of this one!).\nI would like to believe these office quirks mean there is definitely room to work more efficiently. \nI remember the late nights in the office with no fondness, wondering to myself if I should’ve avoided dilly-dallying earlier in the day so I could head off earlier.\nAlthough I usually had other long-suffering colleagues for company, I’m sure we definitely would have preferred to be hanging out somewhere else, instead of having to deal with inconsiderate people who send us urgent emails when the work day is almost over.\nThere might come a day when employers might be more open to giving their workers the choice of a four-day work week.\nOf course, some might choose to work for longer hours and more days, because they are worried that it would translate to more stress at work each day.\nBut one could also make it a goal to work in a more efficient and disciplined way, and reap the rewards of one’s labour over a well-earned long weekend.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nLinette Heng, 34, is a freelance writer who previously worked in the media and banking industry."

            "Article Body": "In May, Singapore athletes did the nation proud by hauling home 51 gold, 43 silver and 64 bronze medals from the Southeast Asia (Sea) Games in Cambodia.\nI remember how I managed to catch some of the sporting action on meWATCH, cheering on Team Singapore from the comfort of my home. \nIt brought back vivid memories about my own 2019 Sea Games experience as a member of the Singapore Men’s underwater hockey team. \nThat adrenaline rush of competitive sports, along with the pride and joy of representing your country was simply unforgettable. \nThat year, underwater hockey made its debut in the games, which was held in the Philippines.\nBy the sheer combined effort of everyone in the Singapore national team and the support staff, we made a clean sweep by bringing home four gold medals in both the men and women categories respectively.\nI remember how jubilant I felt when the national anthem played as my team and I stood on the top step of the podium. \nI was proud, not just for the country, but also for bringing greater exposure to this wonderful sport that involves trying to hit a puck across the bottom of a swimming pool into the other team's goal with a hockey stick, without the aid of breathing devices.\nI recall feeling how all the blood, sweat and tears that I put into the sport — which is still a self-funded sport in Singapore — finally paid off.\nSingapore has traditionally excelled in water sports, such as swimming and water polo.\nUnfortunately, underwater hockey was not included in the most recent Sea Games.\nEven though this was a bitter pill to swallow, my teammates and I continue to train together with the Underwater Hockey Association of Singapore to make this little known sport more accessible to the wider public.\nBut doing so also requires surmounting several sizable hurdles placed along our way.\nFor one, as a self-funded sport, each one of us has to cough up our own funds to purchase equipment and engage overseas coaches, even as we are all on the national team.\nThat also means having to attend overseas training camps in Australia, which are a fundamental part of our Sea Games preparations. \nOver the six-month period leading up to the Sea Games, I had to fork out about S$15,000, which is a substantial sum for anyone.\nThe issue of sports funding is a tricky one, because there are realistically only two avenues where funds can come from — public and private.\nBut for lesser-known sports like underwater hockey, private sponsors aren’t necessarily keen, whereas public funds need to be directed judiciously to various sports.\nMuch has been said earlier this year about uphill challenges faced by self-funded athletes, such as the Singapore’s women tchoukball team that became the world number one despite the fact that the sport is also entirely self-funded.\nI’m no expert on the nuances of sports funding, but I know what it is like for sportsmen to remain competitive in such an environment.\nWhile most of my teammates and I could simply rely on the pay cheques from our day jobs, I know that some of my younger teammates struggled to raise funds. \nOne of them, in particular, was still schooling and she had difficulty paying for her flight ticket to competitions. \nShe would have lost the opportunity of representing Singapore, were it not for a few of her teammates from the women’s national team who came together and offered to help with her expenses. \nThe “catch” was that she had to pay it forward, and commit to coaching the next batch of promising athletes.\nFunding isn’t the only challenge that we face. \nFor one, we need to train in the deeper middle section of swimming pools of Singapore, but because most pools only allow bookings along the length, and not the breadth, it’s hard to find suitable training venues.\nIt was frustrating having to contend with these logistical issues while also trying to be at the top of our game, such as the case for us in the 2019 Sea Games.\nDespite all these challenges, which at times made me contemplate leaving the sport, I chose to stay on, because I firmly believe the future is bright for the sport. \nFor me, I am also not spared from needing to juggle a corporate career with my sporting endeavours. As someone working in a bank, I have demanding nine-to-five work schedules.\nLuckily, my employer DBS provided me with additional paid leave, which gave me the peace of mind and financial security to remain focused on the task of competing for Team Singapore.\nBut even then, the training commitment is significant. During non-competition periods, I still train about three to four times weekly. The frequency increases to about seven to 10 times weekly as we get closer to major competitions like the Sea Games or regional tournaments.\nWhen there were tight work deadlines to meet, I would resume work after training, often from 10pm onwards. \nAs such, I am very grateful to work in an organisation and environment where everyone has been very supportive and understanding. It also helps that DBS’ family-friendly work culture and productivity tools enable me to work efficiently and effectively.\nJuggling work commitments and pursuing your sporting goals may be tough, but not impossible. \nFirst, make sure you surround yourself with a good support and social network. \nFor example, I worked out a win-win arrangement with a friend who happens to be a nutritionist, who can help me out with meal preps for the week.\nSecond, be flexible and adaptable. \nThis may involve rescheduling workouts to accommodate an important work meeting or modifying your training regime. \nFor team sports like underwater hockey, this may be easier said than done as I had to accommodate my schedules with others, who also have their own jobs or classes to contend with.\nWhile keeping a flexible schedule may not be easy, it helps to be organised and be clear about one’s priorities, so that sudden changes and demands do not become a source of stress.\nWhich leads me to my final point, which is to learn how your body works and adapts to physical and mental stress, whether it is from work or from training.  \nShowing up for training is the easy part. The hard part is maintaining the discipline to monitor your vitals daily such as your resting heart rate, so that you know when to tailor your training and work schedules to the limits of what your body can withstand. \nKnowing your body and adapting to its condition is instrumental to consolidate any gains to reach your sporting goals and at the same time, help to maintain energies at the workplace.\nTo me, this is the most important advice I can give for anyone who finds themselves in this position of being a full-time office worker and a part-time national sportsman.\nBecause if I do not get the balance right, all of this would be unsustainable, and I would have to eventually give up on my dreams.  \nAs long as it is physically possible, I will continue to do my best to bring Singapore glory in the pool, while striving to achieve my personal career goals.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nDale Liu Dongliang, 38, is a member of the Singapore Underwater Hockey National Team. He is currently working in DBS Bank’s Institutional Banking Group."

            "Article Body": "As a principal of a childcare centre today, I have to admit that the idea of working with preschool children had never crossed my mind when I was growing up.\nIn my youth, all of my passions and career ambitions were linked to numbers and computers, and I was enamoured by how technology can change people’s lives.\nThe allure of computers in my younger days opened my mind to the possibilities, and as a result, I pursued a Diploma in Information Technology at Nanyang Polytechnic.\nAt the time, I thought my options were quite straightforward. Study hard, get good grades, and enter the industry of my choice. Life seemed set on a comfortable trajectory.\nAs I delved deeper into the world of IT, I found myself piqued by how complex systems operate, and how the ones and zeros make everything tick as it should. There was joy in understanding how numbers work.\nIn this process, I also gained interest to consider accountancy as a possible career path, due to my growing interest in mathematics, and I believed it was a world where I could excel in. \nSo, after graduating in 2007, I entered the world of finance and human resources, making my way through various industries, including advertising and IT over the next nine years.  \nIn this time, one of my most memorable and fulfilling moments was being involved in financial audits and developing communications plans to update employees about a merger that my company was going through. \nDespite it being a challenging period for my former company, it also provided me with a unique opportunity for growth, as what I did at the time had a large impact on my fellow colleagues’ livelihoods.\nBut the winds of change blew into my life in 2016.\nAt the time, I had been regularly babysitting my niece, a toddler, over the weekends. \nI remember one instance when I was rote counting, and she repeated what I said for the first time. My niece’s reaction to this made me feel like I accomplished something immense, and she made my heart flutter in a way that I never felt before.\nIt was through experiences like these that left a lasting impression about childhood development. \nSlowly, I began to appreciate the intricacies of caring for a child. A child’s mind was far more complex than the computers and financial systems I was already so familiar with.  \nAnd so, as my curiosity about early childhood development grew, it became clear that my heart was leading me in a different direction. \nI found myself at a career crossroads. I now yearned for something different in my career path — a chance to find a new purpose and passion. \nBut I realised that switching careers into the early childhood sector was not a simple feat.\nIt meant bridging a significant knowledge gap and attaining certifications to be a qualified educator.\nIt was a daunting prospect, but the chance of being a part of a child's first formal learning experience ignited a passion within me that I couldn't ignore.\nIn May that year, an opportunity knocked on my door as I saw an online job advertisement for an assistant teacher position in Sengkang. Without much hesitation, I applied.\nThe preschool, Greenland Childcare @ Fernvale, was located close to my home, and despite my lack of credentials in early childhood development, the management gave me a chance and offered me a job.\nI remember being excited but also nervous, because this was the stepping stone I needed to transition into this new world. \nWhat made it even more promising was the support the management provided by enrolling me in Workforce Singapore's Career Conversion Programme for Preschool Educators. \nThis was a lifeline, especially for mid-career switchers like me, as it allowed me to juggle work and study simultaneously.\nOver a period of 13 months, I immersed myself in the curriculum, absorbing valuable insights into classroom management strategies. I learned how to navigate the labyrinth of emotions in young children and discovered a plethora of engagement techniques to foster a positive learning environment.\nIt also prepared me to take on the role of a mentor teacher, guiding and supporting newer educators in their journey. More importantly, I was trained to ensure that safety protocols were met.\nIn a nutshell, the comprehensive training taught me the ropes to become a confident and skilled preschool educator.\n\nOne surprising aspect of this journey was the realisation that I am still able to put my previous work experiences to good use.\nMy computer skills found a home in preparing documents for the childcare centre, adding a technical edge to my current role. My problem-solving skills translated seamlessly into the classroom as I helped preschool children and teachers navigate the challenges they encountered.\nFor example, we employ an open and transparent communication between the teachers and parents, which helps when conflicts occur.\nJust as it was in my former company that was undergoing a merger, clear communication, when done in a constructive manner, will lead to better understanding and collaboration among everyone involved.\nI completed the programme in 2017, and with it, I achieved a professional Diploma in Early Childhood Care and Education. It was a moment of immense pride for me to accomplish such a feat at 30.\nWith my newfound knowledge and passion, my career in early childhood took flight. I started as an English teacher that same year.\nAs the years passed, I continued to grow and evolve in this field, taking on more responsibilities and mentoring new educators who were just beginning their journey.\nIt was thrilling to be part of a child's first formal learning experience.\nEarlier this year, I reached a milestone I could have never imagined back when I was crunching numbers and managing finances.\nAs I sit down to reflect on my journey, I know my career has taken an unorthodox path, but I wouldn't have it any other way.\nIt was a hard decision to leave my comfort zone doing something that I was familiar with, and to explore a new world in childhood development. But looking back, it was also one of the most rewarding choices I've made. \nEach day, I wake up knowing that I can make a difference in the lives of these young children, to nurture their curiosity and instil in them the love of learning that may serve them for a lifetime.\n\nI am also deeply committed to supporting my team of teachers in maintaining and enhancing the quality of education in our centre.\nBut while my journey has been a meaningful one, I can't ignore the fact that the early childhood sector in Singapore faces manpower challenges.\nWhile there's a growing awareness of the importance of early childhood education, there remains a significant shortage of qualified educators.\nLast October, the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) said the annual attrition rate in the sector hovered between 10 and 15 per cent over the last few years, in a workforce of about 23,000 people.\nSingapore needs another 3,500 teachers by 2025, the agency said then.\nIn my view, attracting and retaining talent can also be challenging as the profession is physically demanding and also requires a considerable emotional investment in young children.\nThe expectations of parents have also changed towards childcare centres and preschools that offer holistic development opportunities for their children.\nTo keep pace with evolving expectations, I know my industry would need to adopt new learning approaches and adapt to these changes.\nWith safety in preschools being in the limelight recently, we take a proactive approach to ensure the safety of the children in our care. This involves regular safety audits, implementing strict safety protocols, and providing training to staff on child protection and safety measures.\nWhat all these changes also mean is that there is an opportunity for every educator to pick up newer skills and to develop their career in more meaningful ways.\nAs the principal of Greenland Childcare @ Fernvale now, I am entrusted with the responsibility of guiding not only the young minds in our care but also the dedicated team of teachers who work with me.\nMy learning journey, however, did not come to an end. To further develop my career and leadership skills, I embarked on an Advanced Diploma in Early Childhood Leadership at the National Institute of Early Childhood Development.\nThis allowed me to refine my skills in leadership and people management, qualities essential for my role as a principal who is expected to inspire my team of educators.\nAt my centre, for example, we provide mentorship and support to address career progression concerns, with the more experienced educators mentoring the newer ones.\nFor anyone who is contemplating a switch into this industry from another career, there are a bevy of options available to learn the skills needed, as I found out too.\nBeing a preschool educator comes with a multitude of rewards, both intrinsic and extrinsic, that make it a fulfilling and meaningful career. Witnessing a child’s first steps or their first words is an unforgettable experience.\nAlso, each day in a preschool setting is unique, and can be filled with surprises and moments of discovery. This variety keeps the work interesting and dynamic.\nI’m glad I took that first step to make a mid-career switch all those years ago. It is a journey filled with its own set of challenges, but I know the impact that I’ve made on the lives of the young minds under my care is immeasurable. \nBecause of that, it is a voyage worth taking.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:"

            "Article Body": "Growing up, I was overweight and was used to hearing comments about my size.\nI remember how in my primary school days, I had to go to the “Trim and Fit Club” everyday before morning assembly for additional exercise to keep me in shape.\nBut because positive change doesn’t happen overnight, my fellow classmates would remark callously: “Why are you still so fat?”\nMy friends would toss such comments my way If they saw me changing into my exercise kit in class, making mean jokes at my expense, and then laugh about it afterwards.\nUltimately, these were wisecracks that I wasn’t meant to take seriously. But I know that at the time, it hurt to be the butt of their jokes.\nWhat also affected me were the actions by my well-meaning family members too. To help me lose weight, my parents would pass me health shakes and dietary supplements.\nIt reminded me that there was something wrong with my weight. Mealtimes no longer became a source of enjoyment, but a constant battle trying to control my flaws and resist temptation.\nWhenever I looked at the mirror, I looked for imperfections like my flabby tummy, rather than the good aspects of myself. \nFrom the childish banter from my friends, the pre-assembly exercises that I had to do that others didn’t, and the nutritional shakes my parents insisted on, all of these gradually reinforced my own understanding of body weight and dietary habits.\nSo, I tried everything I knew to lose weight. I would drink juices blended from lemon peels, celery, and bitter gourd. According to urban myth, bitter flavours are supposed to help.\nIn any case, whether it was due to my efforts or by nature, I did lose weight as I grew older. Relatives remarked at how fit I looked.\nBut my extreme negativity towards obesity hadn’t changed.\nI am ashamed to admit that it was me who became the aggressor. This time, I was the person who dished out obesity jokes instead of being at the receiving end of them.\nDuring 2008, when swine flu had just broken out in this part of the world, I remember how among my friends, joking about someone’s weight became a popular joke.\nI recall how I would remark that one particular overweight friend looked like a “swine”, which would provoke uncontrollable laughs from my peers. This was even though I knew how much such comments hurt me previously.\nIn my head at the time, it was normal for someone’s size to be joked about, because that was what happened to me in primary school.\nI didn’t realise how superficial my own understanding of a person’s body image and weight issues was, and how much I would regret making those comments, until I had my binge eating episodes.\nDuring a stressful time figuring out what course to take in university as a 21-year-old, I inexplicably began stuffing myself with everything I could get my hands on.\nI would tear through packets of cakes, cookies and chocolates, looking for the next sugar rush to distract me from the vague pit of anxiety I felt.\nAll I knew was that I wanted my anxiety to disappear, and food seemed the easiest way to distract myself from it. it felt straightforward – find food, eat food, feel good.\nBingeing was my way of exerting control over my circumstances, even though it was really a form of losing control. \nRealising that it was a problem, I saw a therapist, who taught me in my first meeting to write a letter of love to myself. Reading that out loud helped with my self-esteem.\nThings also became better after I started a part-time job as a tuition teacher, which helped me realise that I could contribute something to the young lives of these students, and put aside my own anxieties.\nAll of these helped, but only temporarily.\nThree years later, when I graduated from university, I became anxious again trying to find a job.\nOnce again, I turned to binge eating while hunting for a job. It was a vicious cycle that involved being worried about rejection from potential employers, experiencing guilt when bingeing, and feeling worse about myself when I see myself in the mirror.\nThis time, when I saw my therapist, he suggested that I see a psychiatrist. Eventually, I was put on antidepressants.\nWhat also helped greatly was when I joined a group called Overeaters Anonymous. It was a 12-step group modelled after the likes of Alcoholics Anonymous. When I joined in September 2019, it was regularly attended by four to seven people who faced similar problems as me. \nAt these weekly sessions, I would meet others who were also dealing with eating disorders such as bulimia, anorexia, and binge eating. \nIn a safe space such as this, I became open to sharing about what I was going through. The process helped me realise three things.\nOne, that I wasn’t alone in my suffering.\nTwo, that talking about my plight could support others who are also on the path of recovery too.\nThree, it was through such sharing that I realised how difficult it is for men to talk about the eating disorders they may be experiencing.\nYet, men are not immune from body image issues, and like women, need all the help we can get to overcome their situation.\nIt is perhaps an unfortunate byproduct of masculinity that men share less about their emotions.\nI remember a male friend from primary school once telling me about his struggle with bulimia. He spoke how he would stuff his finger down his throat, to induce a gagging reflex to vomit out what he ate.\nHe was slender and tall. You wouldn’t have expected him to suffer from an eating disorder.\nWhen I happened to see him years later, I asked how he was coping with the eating disorder he had shared previously, because I was also trying to cope with mine.\nThere was a flash of fear in his eyes, before he said, “Me? Maybe you remembered wrongly.”\nIt is because of how much talking about my journey openly helped me in trying to deal with my eating disorders, that I decided to pen this column about my experience.\nWe’ve all heard the advice to “talk about it” and to consult with a professional if we feel down. But I want to stress how important such advice is, especially for men who are reticent about reaching out for help.\nI know because I felt the same worries about how people might perceive me as being a wimp, or that it was a form of giving up control over my personal situation, even though as I said earlier, binge eating was, in reality, an unhealthy coping mechanism.\nBut in the absence of such positive open sharing, any male talk about body weight and eating disorders become monopolised by toxic jokes and harmful stereotypes, as I can fully attest to from my childhood.\nAnd that just makes things a lot worse.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nJohn Lim speaks on creating happier workplaces for millennials and is the author of the book Take Heart: Thriving in the Emotional Wilderness.

            "Article Body": "Ever since I started working part-time in secondary school, I have been a florist salesman, a plumber, a bartender, a club entertainer, and a tattoo artist to make ends meet.\nAs one can tell from my eclectic portfolio of job experiences, I had been moving from job to job, with each new stint vastly different from the last. \nI enjoyed what I was doing at times, but along the way, I began to feel a missing sense of purpose in my life. \nI was just getting by in jobs simply by earning my way to justify the lifestyle I led. I wasn’t concerned about the bigger picture, about what my role in the world is, or about finding my own self-actualisation and potential.\nLike a bolt from the blue, this revelation that I needed to find a purpose-filled career struck me three years ago during the pandemic.\nFor the first time, I felt a calling in the most unlikely of places — the maritime industry. But before that, it took me a tediously long journey to find my stable ground.\nGrowing up, I shunned subjects like mathematics and science but loved hands-on topics like art and design. \nBy the time I graduated from secondary school, I had a shelf of sketchbooks that contained design renders, creatures from my imagination, and beautiful things that I wanted to remember.\nAt the time, however, my interest in art felt more like a hobby. I became quite the adventurous happy-go-lucky guy as I grew older and tried many part-time jobs. \nSo, I tried being a florist salesman, a bartender, and even a club performer. The experiences were great, but none felt like the perfect fit.\nLife took an interesting turn at 21 after a chat with my family’s plumber. He didn’t have any kids and wanted to impart his skills to an apprentice. I needed some money and a part-time job. So, I thought, why not?\nThe creative problem-solving aspect that came with being a plumber energised me. For example, I had to think of creative solutions on the spot, like using unconventional rubber bands or washers to fix leaks.\nWhen I was 22, I took up an Advanced Diploma in Business and Management Studies and graduated more than a year later at the East Asia Institute of Management.\nNevertheless, I found myself at a crossroads with mounting financial pressures, and I didn’t have a silver spoon that could see me through this phase of my life. \nYou see, I wanted to live in my own place and support myself independently. I also wanted to pursue a degree, but the course fees were expensive.\nUnfortunately, I couldn’t afford this with the low pay plumbing apprentices get, and it would also take me years before I became a master.\nThis dilemma was what kickstarted my tattooing chapter. Like sketching, tattooing was a deep interest of mine, and I learned from industry friends how lucrative it could be. \nSo, I decided to forgo my further education to enter tattooing full-time. It felt like the right choice as I valued my financial and personal independence.\nBeing a tattoo artist was eye-opening. I discovered that I enjoyed understanding and engaging people. Tattooing is not just about drawing on people’s bodies. It’s about empathising with people’s experiences and turning them into meaningful art.\nWith a well-paying and enjoyable job, I thought being a tattoo artist was the endgame for me. I went from experimenting with tattoos on my own body (and some brave friends) to having regular clients. In a good month, I could earn between S$4,000 and S$5,000.\nUnfortunately, the pandemic in 2020 also caused a crisis for me. I lost my source of income as all local tattoo studios were shuttered indefinitely.\nI was at my lowest point emotionally. I found myself without a regular income, no place to stay, and without purpose. \nI moved back in with my parents and tried freelance jobs to stay afloat, but I lacked the discipline to make a freelance career work in the long run.\nAt this point, I knew I needed a job that could give me a routine. \nAfter a challenging job search, a lifeline emerged when I finally got a maritime operations role in ShipsFocus. I had no clue about the maritime industry, but I needed the job.\nMy first few months were challenging. For example, I was terrible with data and hated using software to crunch shipping and cargo numbers. As a result, I made many mistakes.\nHowever, I knew this was an important opportunity for me. Drawing on the service and hustle mindset from my bartending days, I improved my performance. \nI regularly sought feedback and was extra careful with my work. I even went the extra mile like cleaning the office, making tea for visitors, answering calls, and running office errands.\nEventually, the company’s chief operating officer James Kim noticed how well I could connect with people. \nTo take full advantage of this strength of mine, he subsequently carved out a business development role for me, and the team also gave me the space to learn more about shipping. \nI found myself easing into the role quickly thanks to my colleagues’ support. It was their faith in me that allowed me to earn my sea legs in the industry.\nToday, I am a maritime and operations specialist helping shipping companies to digitalise efficiently and sustainably. In my day-to-day life, I persuade shipping personnel to use our software to execute daily tasks, instead of relying on emails, phone calls, or faxes.\nThe job soon grew on me, as I realised that despite the completely different skill sets involved, I was frequently reminded of my past jobs.\nWhen I engage maritime stakeholders to understand their needs and challenges, I remember my time as a tattoo artist working with clients and their needs. \nWhen I find creative digital solutions for their operational challenges, I feel the same satisfaction I had as a plumber trying to fix a leak.\nMy biggest realisation was that I was working for something larger than myself. I discovered that maritime was not a staid and outdated industry, but a rapidly transforming sector full of exciting opportunities. \nBy helping ship companies to digitalise, I’m not just supporting myself, but building an important legacy in an industry that never sleeps.\nThat was what motivated me to overcome my rough start. Because of one success with a recent deal I managed to clinch, my boss has officially christened me as “Justin 2.0”.\nMy next step is to start upskilling myself to repay the faith my bosses had in me. I’m on my way to becoming “Justin 3.0”, by learning new skills in user experience design, digital marketing, and programming.\nI live by a mantra — Aut inveniam viam aut faciam — which in Latin means “I shall either find a way or make a way”. \nWhen life keeps throwing curveballs in my direction, I have always found a way out. Even when I struggled through the pandemic and an unexpected career switch, I was able to find a way.\nFor the first time in a long time, I feel like I’m in control. I have a future-ready job, a financially responsible lifestyle, a steady routine, and a renewed focus in life.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nJustin Chua Xian An, 27, is a maritime applications and operations specialist."

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "Design has always held a special place in my heart since I was young.\nFrom the satisfaction of neatly arranged text on a form, to the awe at beautifully crafted spaces, I have always been aware and appreciative of the profound influence of good design.\nAt the same time, I was also piqued by how designs, even poorly conceived ones, lead people to change their behaviour.\nThere’s the concept of desire paths — unsanctioned routes that are inadvertently created when people take repeated shortcuts, over a field for example, because the paved pathways fail to consider pedestrians’ needs.\nI was always noticing things such as insufficient signage and convoluted wayfinding in larger MRT stations that confuse commuters on which exit they should take, or how bus drivers always had to get out of their seats to deploy the ramp for passengers in wheelchairs.\nAll of these small frustrations people face on a daily basis are linked to design. Growing up, I paid special attention to examples where more thought could have been given to user experience and make lives easier.\nSo, it was only natural for me to pursue a degree in architecture at the National University of Singapore, graduating in 2020 with a Master's degree. \nJust as my predecessors ahead of me trod the well-beaten path of becoming an architect, I did so too, joining the industry shortly after my graduation. \nI thought I could carve out a career designing various beautiful and thoughtful spaces that people would admire and love.\nDuring my internships and early in my career as an architectural designer, I had the opportunity to work on diverse projects from public housing competitions to good class bungalows, and in the commercial sector, from shophouses to hospitality resorts. \nBut it was during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic that I experienced a profound shift in perspective towards work.\nWitnessing first-hand the impact and limitations of physical spaces — living rooms morphed into office spaces, while open offices became insufficient and underutilised in the era of Zoom calls and hybrid work — I began to doubt the lasting impact I could make as an architectural designer.\nFor me, architecture is the application of design in a way that is well-positioned to impact people, being largely related to the spaces we work, play and sleep in on a daily basis. \nA well-designed space can impact much of our daily lives, from designing with thermal comfort and natural ventilation in mind to providing inhabitants with a sense of safety.\nBut while being an architect was challenging and exciting, I wished I could go further with my work. What comes next after a space is built? A space is so much more than its initial design, yet the impact of designers often ceases upon the handover and completion of the project.\nDuring Covid-19, one of my projects at the time was to work on staff accommodation where we had to future-proof our design to comply with quarantine requirements, while still ensuring the efficient use of limited space. \nBut that got me thinking further: What about the existing spaces we already have? Who then tackles these changing requirements as they arise? \nAn empty school can double up as a testing centre, but it was designed firstly as an institution for learning. A hostel can likewise be repurposed for quarantine, but was designed for social interactions and communal living. \nWhile they serve their new, functional purpose, they were never intended to and are not ideal for what they were now meant to achieve. \nPeople’s needs change, and the intended user likewise changes, even if our buildings do not. \nI found myself wanting to do something that was more focused on the human experience, to see where I would be able to work directly with end users of my work to constantly iterate and improve to build better impact.\nI wanted to seek out something beyond simply making a bungalow or skyscraper prettier for a single property owner. I wanted my designs to have a positive impact on many people, to improve experiences and to remove the frustrations that others face.\nMost of all, I wanted to find meaning in my work.\nAs I was exploring options outside the industry, I was also working towards taking the professional exam in my journey to qualify as an architect.\nBeing an architect was a career path I had decided to embark upon all those years ago. \nMaking a career change at that juncture felt like it was going against all I worked for and it felt like I was giving up before achieving my goals.\nSome friends also cautioned against making such a move, emphasising how doing so would be a waste of those five long years invested into getting a Master’s degree in a specialised field.\nTo them, it seemed like a waste of time, money, and effort. I’d also worked for a year in the architecture field at that point.\nFriends were also concerned that I would be forgoing the opportunity to become a professional architect and the possibility of setting up my own practice, which they saw as something prestigious and illustrious.\nWhile they definitely had my interests at heart, I was also fortunate to have a counterweight in the advice of my family and other friends who encouraged me to explore new horizons while I was still young.\nThey persuaded me to view things from a different perspective: that if my intention really was to create good designs to impact people, there were other ways to skin this cat. \nDespite their surprise at my decision, it was through the help of my supportive friends that I landed my current role as a workplace experience designer in late 2021 at DBS' Corporate Real Estate Strategy and Administration team.\nIn my current job, my team and I work by observing users, soliciting their feedback, and conducting experiments to find out what works best for them.\nFor instance, as part of the bank’s effort to create purposeful spaces for hybrid work, my teammates and I ran pilots to design “ideation rooms” to enhance productivity and creativity which were based on behavioural research.\nWe designed these purpose-built spaces to be used for brainstorming workshops, but occupying the space to make conference calls would be a poor utilisation of their value, impeding their use for those who need them most. \nTo nudge intended behaviour, we placed atypical meeting room furniture such as stools and standing desks to create an atypical meeting setting, whilst also encouraging active participation to keep workshops focused.\nTo catalyse recycling habits among staff members, my team and I prototyped intuitive recycling bins and educational nudges. We experimented with reducing vending machine usage and optimising food waste management in our two staff cafeterias.\nUltimately, it’s about tailoring workspaces to meet needs.\nUnlike an architect whose role is largely done once the building is built, as a workspace designer, it also means continuously monitoring and dealing with user feedback so that the design of spaces, or otherwise, can be improved upon.\nWhile some may scoff at the idea that I’ve moved away from designing buildings to create office waste bins, I do not see this job as any less important or prestigious.\nTo me, the expanded scope of what I am doing now is an exciting challenge and getting to work on a wide variety of projects was something I looked forward to in my work. I was lucky to be able to make this career transition without a significant financial impact on myself.\nAt the end of the day, workplace experience design is a different trade from architecture.\nTo me, I derive more meaning from creating a good working environment for many more people than I did as an architect.\nSpaces are meant to be used by people, and so their designs can either elevate or detract from their purposes. I know that the work I do thus has an outsized impact on more people who actually need to work in these buildings.\nNearly two years into this new role, I continue to learn and grow each day. While transitioning from architecture to experience design required a significant shift in focus, I was thankful that my university education in design thinking had helped to ease the change.\nOn this note, my career switch might not be as drastic or a complete change as many others, but the personal journey I had to go through to find meaning in work was still a challenge. I still needed to overcome my mental hurdles.\nLooking back, I always had a choice of what I wanted to be committing my time and energy to.\nNot everyone might make the same choices I did if they were in my situation, since one can find meaning in work in many ways.\nSome choose to dive deep into their passions, others look squarely at the money they make from work, or some see the impact they leave behind from their work as the most important factor of all.\nWhat matters is that you have to decide what is important to you. And at the end of the day, when you find out what that is, know that it is better to have tried something that might not work out than to regret not trying at all.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nMarcus Liu, 29, is a workplace experience designer at DBS Bank."

            "Article Body": "For a long time, I never understood what it meant when others said life is short, and that I should therefore live it to its fullest.\nLife, to me at the time, was not about finding new adventures or stepping into the unknown. \nI didn’t believe in abandoning stable paths to seek out personal passions. There was always going to be time for me later on in life to chase my dreams. \nAt 21, I “signed on” during National Service as a full-time communications systems officer in the Navy. \nThis job came to me at a time of great uncertainty. My hawker parents had just lost their beloved stall after the building it was situated in got torn down, and I, being an only child, felt an overwhelming sense of duty to get my career straightened out to put their minds at ease. \nAlthough this was not a passion, my job offered a strong sense of camaraderie as well as a degree of stability that I appreciated at the time. \nBefore the end of my five-year contract with the Navy, I had already settled on renewing and extending my stay.\nThis changed, however, after the sudden passing of a dear friend. When I first heard that he had drowned in an unfortunate accident (that was not job-related), I was filled with complete disbelief, sadness, and then, regret about the life he never got to live.\nI had always thought he had the best potential to succeed in life among our group of friends, as he had a tenacious work ethic that I often tried to emulate.\nAs I reminisced about the past six years we had spent together, going through thick and thin in the same company during National Service and as fellow full-time servicemen, I then started to wonder if he had other passions, hopes and dreams that he wanted to pursue.\nAt 27, surely he had big, bold ambitions he wanted to achieve. \nPerhaps he had taken a pause on these goals, thinking he could wait another year before taking that first step. He would not have known what was to come — no one could have known.\nThose same thoughts stuck with me for the next couple of days, prompting me to take a hard look at the life I had lived up to that point and where I truly wanted to go next. \nIt wasn’t that my job at the Navy lacked fulfilling experiences. Conversely, there were plenty of opportunities to travel across Southeast Asia as well as being able to meet lifelong friends on the job.\nBut rather, it was the fact that I wanted to spread my wings and pursue a career that was closer to my heart, so that I can live without regrets of having not tried.\nIt took me some time to decide that I needed to move on. But as they say, it’s always easier said than done, and I needed to take giant steps in order to switch careers. \nI panicked when I started to think about where I wanted to be in the next five to ten years of my career. I began to realise that I had reached a “saturation point” and felt that I needed to make some changes in my life to find fulfilment in the years to come.\nBut what would bring me satisfaction? I thought back to what I had always wanted to do in my youth, but was never able to commit to my interests due to various reasons.\nI realised I always had an interest in electrical engineering, and remembered that this was something I had wanted to pursue back in my polytechnic days.\nBut I thought that door was shut due to my poor academic results at the time.\nEven then, my appreciation for the industry never truly faded. \nI thought about how I enjoyed my role as a communications systems officer in the Navy, which allowed me to be surrounded by machines. While I could perform basic procedures like corrective maintenance when systems malfunctioned, I was curious about their inner workings.\nBy coincidence, a few of my friends were also thinking about taking on “upskilling” courses during that time and were also seeking to switch their careers. So, I joined them as we mapped out a realistic roadmap. \nBut throughout this process, the decision to switch careers continued to weigh heavily on me. My main doubts were about whether I could cope with going back to school again, as I still needed to attain the right qualifications for my desired job. \nI was 28 at the time — still relatively young but the last I stepped into a classroom was years ago. I was afraid that I lacked the youthful vigour needed to endure the trials and tribulations of the classroom.\nAs I battled these doubts, I discovered Ngee Ann Polytechnic’s (NP) early admissions exercise for working adults, which opened the door for me to pursue a Diploma in Electrical Engineering with the polytechnic.\nWith my parents’ blessings and NP’s support, I could pay my school fees in instalments, which lessened the financial burden. \nAs there was a pandemic at the time, I began lessons in a virtual classroom in April 2020.\nMy first semester was rocky, to say the least. Apart from the acute awareness of how I was many years older than my classmates, there was also trepidation from my lack of a strong foundation in calculus and physics, which, unfortunately, were needed for the bulk of my modules in the first semester.\nOnline classes were also nothing short of challenging. Everything was so heavily reliant on the Internet and connectivity that I sometimes found myself feeling a sense of fatigue towards virtual calls. \nHaving to navigate assignments and lectures in the confines of my room also felt stifling, much akin to what I felt during long deployments at sea.\nEven when in-person classes did resume, they were definitely awkward at the very beginning. It was clear to us that we did not really know one another, even though we had been on the same calls for an entire semester.\nLooking back, I’m glad to say that I pushed through. Soon enough, I found myself fully immersed in student life. I feel incredibly lucky to say that, despite my worries, no lecturer or peer made me feel any less just because I was older, so much so that the age difference felt almost non-existent at times.\nWhile I had zero expectations of finding any friends due to the age gap, this proved not to be the case when I eventually formed a solid group of friends through group projects and common interests, including manga, television shows, and more.\nAbove all, studying what I loved and had a passion for made all the difference. I never thought that I could thrive in school, but here I was, genuinely finding joy in attending classes and taking a deep dive into the world of programming. \nIt felt as though I was indulging in a hobby that ultimately opened a whole new world of opportunities to me.\nWe are often primed to think that there are only a few designated pathways to pursuing a degree, and that if we are not on these pathways, our hopes are dashed. I have discovered that this is not the case.\nTo anyone thinking of a mid-career switch to pursue your passion, there are options, including part-time diplomas, and support systems that make the journey far less daunting. \nThe first step always starts with researching what is out there and seeing the possibilities that are available if you just take a leap of faith. Understanding the courses offered by NP and the resources provided to adult learners made a huge difference in my decision to return to school.\nThis also requires the charting of realistic timelines and expectations for yourself.\nFor instance, I started out thinking I could balance both work and studies by pursuing a part-time diploma, only to realise that I would not be able to cope with the rigour that both work and school demanded. \nI did not have to do this alone, of course, and had friends and family to talk to and offer advice. \nConsult those whom you trust, be it your parents or your friends, and get them to be your sounding board as you try to pinpoint your passions, what you want to do in life, and how you are going to get there. \nLastly, remember to enjoy the process of returning back to school, especially if you are going back as a full-time student. There are extracurricular activities to help you immerse fully in the school environment, and making new friends will come naturally too.\nGoing back to school as an adult is tough, but it doesn’t have to be tedious.\nHaving graduated in May this year, I can look back at my past three years as an adult learner with great fondness. \nI am still on that road, and today I am preparing to pursue a degree in computer science at a university level, something that I didn’t think was possible.\nWe only have one life and living it the best way possible, on our own terms, sometimes means having to leave behind what seems to be familiar and safe, and taking the road less travelled.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nAlvin Ong, 31, is a Ngee Ann Polytechnic graduate and has a diploma in electrical engineering. He was formerly a naval officer."

            "Article Body": "Growing up obsessed with pop culture, I was certain that my goal in life was to become a radio deejay. I was passionate about the music scene and was the programme director of my polytechnic’s very own radio station. \nConvinced that this was my road to success, I sought to turn my passion and craft into a professional career in media and entertainment.\nSo, as a 17-year-old, I embarked on my diploma in mass communications at Ngee Ann Polytechnic with a clear vision of what I wanted to do in the future.\nBut as they say, life is what happens to you while you’re making other plans.\nDuring my final year of my diploma studies, both my grandfathers had to go in and out of the hospital for various reasons. \nMy maternal grandfather had Alzheimer’s disease, which eventually led to him struggling with severe dementia. \nHe started losing his memory and his ability to independently carry out his daily activities, and my grandmother had to take up the role of being his primary caregiver.\nI remember offering to stay over to watch my grandfather overnight so that my grandmother could rest and take a break from her caregiving responsibilities. \nI spent the entire night watching him abruptly wake up from his sleep, watching him while his eyes stayed open, talking to the ceiling over and over again while trying to take off his mittens that we had to put on to protect himself from involuntarily scratching his fragile skin.\nThis gave me my first glimpse of what it was like to be a caregiver and having to bear the physical, emotional and mental load of someone who could not do it for themselves any longer. \nBut being only 19 and having zero medical knowledge at the time, all I knew was that my grandpa was slowly slipping away, and my time left with him was limited.\nOver the next few months, my grandfather’s condition deteriorated and he had to be admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH). \nThis was my first ever memory of being in a hospital setting. He was admitted to a geriatric ward but was only there for a short period of time before he passed on. \nI remember being the one to realise that he had stopped breathing, and alerted my family members who then informed the nurse in charge. \nI was impressed with how calm and collected the nurses were, and how they exercised compassion towards us and treated my grandfather with dignity in his final moments. \nSadly, less than a year later, my paternal grandfather unexpectedly passed away as well.\nTheir deaths struck me deeply, because they were the first closest relatives of mine that I had lost. I was experiencing and understanding grief for the first time in my life. \nIt was also at this point in time that I was in the last few months of my diploma studies and had to start my university applications. \nAlthough I had really wanted to further my studies in communications, my grades were not adequate enough to enrol into the course that I had wanted. \nSo, I stopped to rethink what I wanted my future to look like.\nMy father suggested trying out nursing because I always had a soft spot for the elderly and loved taking care of people. \nI was unsure at first, and started to ask around to see what people thought of me joining the profession.\nAlthough many said that they couldn’t imagine me being anyone other than “Kim the DJ”, some said otherwise and easily pictured me becoming a nurse. \nI then learnt that growing up, the women who I looked up to as role models also happened to be nurses. My paternal grandmother worked as a senior assistant nurse. The captain of my Girls’ Brigade co-curricular activity in Presbyterian High School at the time is currently an advanced practice nurse.\nIn that sense, I felt an affinity with the industry even though it was not something that I had considered before.\nAnother big motivator was the fact that I wanted to study something that would give me more practical skills, after the helplessness I felt during my two grandfathers’ final months.\nI wanted to be able to take care of my parents and family in the future, and not feel as clueless as I previously did.\nSo, I decided to enrol in nursing school at the National University of Singapore with no medical knowledge at all. \nThe first few months were an uphill battle, and I remember constantly reflecting on whether I made the right choice. \nBut thankfully, I managed to find my footing one step at a time, and fell in love with the exciting new journey I was on.\nEventually, I graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in nursing in 2020.\nBut my final year was the hardest hurdle to cross, as the Covid-19 pandemic had thrown the world of healthcare into a tizzy.\nI was attached to TTSH as part of my final hospital attachment before I graduated. That was in April 2020, when the first circuit-breaker was implemented in Singapore. \nI admit I was very scared to leave the safety of my home to head to the hospital at a time when not much was known about the virus. It was a strange sensation to head to work when everyone was forced to stay home.\nBut the work needed to be done and lives needed to be saved. \nA few months later, I officially started work as a staff nurse in TTSH. Due to the strict safe distancing measures back then, many of our orientation programmes were delayed, cancelled, or conducted online instead. \nThis meant that we had to adapt and learn many things on-the-job. \nAs much as I would’ve liked to say that I coped with the transition well, the truth is that I had never experienced this much stress and anxiety before. \nNothing could have prepared me fully for how mentally, physically, and emotionally demanding nursing was.\nFrom having to increase my knowledge through learning about different diseases, care plans and medications, and keeping up with the ever-changing protocols; to becoming competent and efficient in my nursing care, I was forced to absorb everything and learn from my seniors as quickly as possible. \nDue to the heavy workload, I lost a lot of weight. This definitely made work even more draining: Imagine a 42kg 24-year-old trying to carry patients double or triple her size.\nTruth be told, there were more lows than highs in my first year of nursing. \nBut the one thing that always rekindled my sense of purpose was reminding myself that although I wasn’t able to take care of my grandfathers anymore, I was entrusted with the duty of looking after someone else’s life at their most vulnerable state.\nHaving that perspective really kept me grounded and motivated me to continue to be the best nurse I could be for my patients. \nThree fulfilling years later, I’m currently a senior staff nurse in an acute internal medicine unit at TTSH. \nI’m also currently a preceptor to students and new nurses who are at the start of their nursing journey. I do my best to support them just like how my seniors supported me at the beginning of my career.\nI frequently reflect on my journey and think about how differently I deal with similar situations now, thanks to the experience I’ve gained over the past few years. \nI know that three years ago, I would not have had the confidence I currently possess to handle demanding patients and their family members, while being efficient and effective in the coordination of my patients’ care.\nBut it was thanks to hard work and the support of my seniors that showed me how it is done.\nWith Nurses Day approaching on Aug 1, I’m also proud of how the role of nurses has evolved over the years, as well as the opportunities given to us to specialise in our areas of interest such as research, education, management, or clinicals. \nNursing is hardly a stagnant role, and there are schemes to encourage innovation among us too. For example, TTSH’s Nursing Innovation Bunch has a S$1,000 funding scheme for new nurses to trial their innovative ideas in their first and second year of employment.\nI’m able to do less repetitive and strenuous tasks thanks to robotics and automation, which frees up my energy to focus on building trust and strong relationships with my patients and their families. \nThis allows me to provide more holistic patient care and attend to their emotional needs, a vital aspect of a patient’s recovery journey that is often overlooked.\nI decided to write this article because my career in TTSH nursing has been nothing short of fulfilling and exciting, despite all the challenges that come along with it. \nEvery shift is completely different, and you learn and experience something new every single day. It’s one of the professions that changes your life for the better while you do the same for others.  \nDespite mostly being in clinical nursing, I’ve also embarked on many creative projects along the way in TTSH, tapping into my past as a mass communications student.\nFrom creating nursing content for our social media, to writing articles and hosting events, I’ve been given many opportunities to keep my creative side alive. \nMy advice to anyone who might be at the crossroads of deciding what career path to head down would be to take a chance at something new.\nAfter all, my experience taught me that we don’t just have one passion in life to pursue.\nWork hard and learn as much as you can no matter which stage of life you’re in. You’ll pick up things that’ll help you wherever you’re going next, even though they may seem completely irrelevant at that point in time.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nKimberley-Ann Tan Zi Ying, 27, is a senior staff nurse at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. She is a member of TTSH nursing’s Recruitment Operations and Business Strategic Team, also known as Robust, and is a part of its social media sub-committee. "

            "Article Body": "Last year, I decided to join an online reality dating show called One Week Love. The show premiered on The Smart Local’s YouTube channel in October 2022 and follows a similar format to Netflix’s Singles’ Inferno, where nine contestants try to find love in seven days.\nThe show grew in popularity, striking a chord, especially with the Gen Zs, who were waiting in anticipation for a new up-and-coming dating reality show.\nAnd while I would gladly go through this experience of being on a trendy online show all over again, I’m not sure if I can confidently say that this is an experience for everyone.\nWhen I first heard about the casting call, I jumped at the opportunity, just because of how different I knew this experience would be from my day job.\nI am a senior strategy and consulting analyst at Accenture, a global professional services firm. In my role, I work closely with clients, dedicating extensive time to conducting in-depth research and assisting them in tackling complex business challenges.\nLife on a “reality” show and my actual day-to-day reality seemed to be worlds apart.\nI thought One Week Love came at an opportune time, right when I wanted to step out of my comfort zone and meet new people. \nAfter all, how many 27-year-olds can say that they have been a contestant on a reality dating show before?\nSo, while I went in thinking I would be the carefree spirit who would go home with a date to call their own, the story changed when the cameras went on.\nReality shows feed on drama, and I knew that when I signed up. But I just never expected myself to be caught in the series of developments that ensued. \nFor example, in the earlier episodes where my castmates thought I was being “too close for comfort” because I was helping another female castmate adjust her microphone.\nIn the later episodes, I was called out by one of my castmates as the one who really “needed to work on their social cues” during a segment called “Unfine Dining”, where castmates have to pick between answering a difficult question or be forced to eat a nauseating dish. \nBut it was the overall narrative that I had no control over, and I was at the mercy of the producers and editors.\nTo keep the long story short, I gradually became seen as the antagonist.\nWhether that is fair or not, I would leave readers to judge if they happen to watch the show. But I wanted to pen this piece, perhaps as an epilogue to the series, but also to put it out there about what life was like for me after the cameras turned off. \nIt was demoralising being perceived as the antagonist, but I continued believing in myself and my intentions. \nI admit to initially being upset when I realised what was happening. I chose to bite my tongue and held back the desire to go into defensive mode, opting instead to hear them out, which helped defuse the situation.\nWith all cameras on you, every micro-expression was captured. I didn’t know what other castmates thought of me at the time, but I knew my actions and how I reacted were within my control.\nI watched the show when it finally got posted online several months later.\nListening to the participants describe their first impressions of me was quite a surreal experience, akin to hearing your recorded voice for the first time.\nBut I was also nervous about how I would be perceived, and indeed, it was initially quite shocking scrolling through the comments and reading what the public thought of me. \nI wasn’t portrayed in the most positive light by the ladies in the show, several comments popped up in the earlier episodes on my behaviour, with some even calling me a “creep”.\nTo be honest, those comments stung.\nBut I kept my head in check and chose to put those comments aside. I told myself that how I was portrayed in the show was not a definition of who I really was as an individual.\nNonetheless, I watched these episodes with a bunch of friends or had watch sessions with my fellow castmates, as it made it easier to be less self-critical of my performance. Having the company also made the experience less confrontational, and more manageable.\nNearly ten months after the show was broadcast, I’ve gotten past most of these comments. \nIt helped that #JusticeforGari eventually became a trending term nearing the final few episodes when people started realising how severely misunderstood and misrepresented I was on the show.\nI felt vindicated by the hashtag and the positive public comments about me that flooded the comments section. Thank goodness for those.\nComing out of the show, while I did not “find love” as I had initially expected, I found myself in the company of the few castmates who I can now call my friends. \nI’m also incredibly proud of the experience I’ve gained on the show — I stuck to my guns, and was authentically “me”, and I wouldn’t have changed anything even if I were to do it all over again.\nAt my job at Accenture, I learnt that a consultant’s first impression is almost as important as the strength of their counsel in building trust with and gaining the respect of our clients. \nThough I was intimately familiar with the importance of perception, I realised from my experience on the show that as hard as I tried, I could not control how I was going to end up being perceived.\nEven though I have learnt to peg this roller-coaster of an experience as being a part of “show business”, I cannot deny the struggles of having to maintain public perceptions, especially when it is amplified across social media, and spotlighted in the public’s eye.\nSafe to say, I’ve not just taken a step out of my comfort zone when I decided to join One Week Love, but I’ve run deep into the horizon with it. \nFrom the show, one of my greatest takeaways is learning that most of the time, all we can do is roll with the punches, learn from our mistakes, and aim to emerge a better person, a mindset that I’ve carried with me till now in my day-to-day life.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nGarialdi Salim, 27, is a senior analyst in the strategy and consulting team at Accenture Singapore."

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "I still remember the first time I heard a Taylor Swift song during a long bus ride — I was 20 and was sharing earphones with my best friend on her iPod.\nShe had recently discovered and fallen in love with the singer and her songs, one of which was a tune about a girl who had teardrops on her guitar because of an unrequited love named Drew. \nOne might think that since I am the same age as Swift (we are both born in 1989), I’d understand a song that Swift wrote as a 17-year-old teenage girl for her debut album at the time.\nBut my first impressions listening to Swift’s song on that bus was that it sounded like an angsty teen whining about her love life.\nAnd so, I judged my friend’s taste in music negatively, though I now think that I was being rather mean at the time. I also wondered if there was something going on in her love life that I did not know about. \nI took notice of her later albums (Red was my favourite) and spent my early 20s listening to her various heartbreaks and exploits.\nEventually, I lost interest in her music at some point and have never been to any of her concerts when she came to Singapore, namely the Red Tour in 2014 and the 1989 World Tour in the following year. \nBut at the height of the pandemic in 2020, Swift collaborated with two of my other favourite artists — Bon Iver and The National. The moody, dreamy vibes of The Long Pond Studio Sessions, a documentary about her album Folklore which featured both artists, really resonated with me at that time. \nAfter that, I was hooked again. Tay Tay was cool again, in my books.\nEven though my music tastes have evolved over the years, I have found her verses mostly on-point.\nThe confessional, heartfelt nature of her lyrics has always made listening to her songs feel like reading her diary. \nLike her eager fans and self-styled detectives, I remember scrutinising the easter eggs she would drop in her lyrics and music videos for clues about her personal life. \nAnd even when I stopped listening to her music, my fascination with her private life continued. \nBecause I follow her on social media, , I know she has three cute cats — Meredith Grey, Olivia Benson and Benjamin Button — who regularly appear on her Instagram feed. She is close to her mom, who is battling cancer.   \nI guess it is also inevitable for Swifties to be overly invested in her love life, and I admittedly am guilty for this too. \nI stopped being a fan of John Mayer (the most-likely villain in her song Dear John), thought Harry Styles (did he inspire the track Style?) was cool, and was confused about her fling with Tom Hiddleston.\nThen, I betrayed her by siding with the Kardashians during the infamous phone call in 2016.\nActor Jake Gyllenhall, who dated Swift for three months in 2009 when she was 20 and he was 29, was arguably the protagonist in the fan favourite song All Too Well. He is still a subject of heated debate among her fans. \nIn recent months, her whirlwind relationship with Matt Healy of rock band 1975 was in the spotlight because of his past misogynist comments during a podcast surfaced. Many fans expressed their disappointment. They have reportedly split ways.\nExplaining the infamous spat between Kanye West and Taylor Swift would require diagrams and timelines, but it is not difficult for any fan to recount, though I won’t attempt to tackle it here.\nThe point is: Many of her fans would fight to their death for her as if they knew her personally.\nI’m almost embarrassed to admit I know all these details about a celebrity. I fell so deep into the rabbit hole, even though ironically, the friend who introduced me to Taylor Swift is no longer a fan.\nAt this point, readers who are non-Taylor Swift fans must be rolling their eyes at yet another public declaration of love for the star, amid all the news about Swift’s Singapore concerts.\nBut I decided to pen this piece because I saw some confusion over why she is such a cultural phenomenon, and why my fellow Swifties were so feverish in their pursuit of concert tickets.\nFull disclosure: I tried for a seat at the Eras Tour. My queue number was over 470,000 for the UOB pre-sale and 981,181 for the general sales.\nI eventually got tickets from a much more resourceful fan who rallied eight family members and friends to book tickets during the pre-sale.\nBut even if I had not, I don’t think I would be shedding any tears.\nThere are many reasons for the overwhelming response despite a whopping six shows available, and the rest of Southeast Asia were eyeing those tickets too. After all, she hasn’t performed here in eight years. \nStill, the overnight, snaking lines at some SingPost outlets for the tickets and the emotional outbursts of some fans through the traumatic (in their own words) ticket-buying process drew some judgement.\nSpeaking in defence of the fans, I understand how some fans might feel death by a thousand cuts when they realised they would not be able to watch her perform live with other fans. \nA part of me thinks this parasocial behaviour is weird. \nTaylor Swift reminds me of a friend who has an interesting, messy life. Just that instead of listening to a long, meandering rant, I am rapt as she croons about how ‘’casually cruel in the name of being honest’’ an ex was.\nIn Antihero, a song from her latest album midnights, Swift reflects on being older but never wiser. This level of self-awareness is admirable because it is rare, and stuck with me as I’m approaching my mid-30s. \nExcept of course, how could most people possibly relate to her? She was revealed to be the celebrity whose private jet emitted the most carbon dioxide in 2022. \nShe is currently worth an estimated US$740 million (S$998 million) — with her revenue mostly coming from record sales and concerts — and is expected to become a billionaire by the end of her Eras Tour, according to Forbes. \nHer relationships are not always the only aspect of her life under judgement. \nHer activism has been accused of being calculated and performative: she was criticised for not speaking out more during the Trump years and was previously accused of using LGBT rights as a fashion statement in her catchy jingle “You need to calm down”.\nIn a way, I sympathise with her.\nDespite gender equality at its golden age, women are often still held to different standards — Taylor Swift has sung about how she has been judged for ‘’playing the field’’ because of her dating history, but a man would be considered a ‘’boss’’ or ‘’alpha type’’ for the same thing.\nThat is just the reality that we live in.\nI think Miss Americana, in her never-ending quest to be relatable and likeable, has over-delivered. \nAfter all, many of her fans have inevitably fallen willingly into her charms, myself included.\nShe is one of the most heavily scrutinised women in the world, and in all this chaos, she makes the best out of it with her sad, beautiful, tragic hooks.\nI think Swift is just another singer with a complicated, albeit highly marketable, personal life.\nBut she is also a savvy storyteller, and I respect that despite all the drama, she is still captivating younger audiences today. \n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nLinette Heng, 33, is a freelance writer."

            "Article Body": "For some time now, finding a partner and getting married has been on my mind.\nYou might laugh, but for the past 27 years of my life, I’ve never had a girlfriend. Not one.\nI didn’t think it’d be this hard. I had thought that running a business, pumping iron in the gym everyday, and volunteering to serve the needy would have made me an ideal bachelor.\nTurns out that wasn’t the case.\nI had two sources of dates.\nFrom July 2022, I went for some networking events that required in-person attendance. If I hit it off with someone during the conversation, I would ask them if they wanted to go on a date with me.\nThis may have sounded desperate in a Singaporean context, but I thought: “Well, there’s nothing to lose. If they said no, I would never see them again anyway.”\nThree out of five people I approached gave me their numbers.\nThen in October 2022, I tried the dating app Coffee Meets Bagel as an experiment. For two weeks, I matched with (almost) everyone the app served. \nThey say beggars can’t be choosers, so I tried my best to match with everyone.\nI got three dates from there.\nI stopped after two weeks because being alerted about new matches everyday distracted me from focusing on the dates that I had lined up.\nThat’s a total of six potential partners — three from in-person events, and three from the dating app.\nBut none of them proceeded to what they call the “exclusive dating” stage, the phase when two people are only seriously seeing each other and no one else.\nBasically, I was dating, but I wasn’t getting attached. Was something wrong with me?\nIn order to go on a romantic date, I first had to nail down an actual chronological date. \nBut this process can be anything but romantic. I remember one lady whom I met over a dating app, sending me a copy of her online calendar to pick out an available slot.\nIt felt like I was booking a doctor’s appointment.\nPerhaps what was missing here was the spontaneity of meeting someone organically, whether in school, at the workplace, or in the course of doing some activity together.\nWith these sort of networking events and dating applications, gone are the unrushed interactions that allowed people to find a serendipitous spark.\nWhen we met for the date, it felt like we both had to put on a performance.\nIt almost seemed like an interview, where both of us were trying to see if we were the right fit for each other.\nIn this instance, it was my fault for being a picky dating partner. I took an approach in which if I felt she wasn’t interesting enough, I wouldn’t arrange the next.\nBut looking back, perhaps this was extremely unforgiving of me. Was it really possible to say that someone wasn’t for you after an hour?\nIt almost felt like I was setting us up for failure.\nDesiring a change, I moved on from using dating apps, and paid S$540 to a blind dating agency to help me meet dates.\nBut finding a person to date is just one brief aspect of the chase. \nI underestimated how much time, effort and energy it takes to nurture that spark. I didn’t think that finding a girlfriend would take this much headspace. \nFor one, I quickly realised that I was out of touch with many of my dates who preferred to text. Using WhatsApp or Telegram to nurture a relationship was something which I couldn’t grasp.\nI’m that sort of bloke who only sends texts to confirm the time, place, and agenda of meetings.\nAfter all, why do that when it is so much more efficient to meet, have quality time, and build a relationship from there?\nIt wasn’t that I didn’t want to text, but the fact that after a long day at work, I found it difficult to sit down in front of my phone, look at the text, and try to think of something witty and funny to say.\nIt felt like replying to an email at work.\nIn hindsight, maybe I could have put in more effort to go to texting classes and learn to communicate better.\nFemale friends tell me that texting is a way to figure out if the guy throws up any red flags before the meeting.\nThey say that it is not the quantity of text messages that made a difference. Rather, it was whether these text messages exuded empathy, love and care.\nAccording to research published in the Journal of Couple and Relationship Therapy, which surveyed 276 men and women in their early 20s, partners who sent caring and loving messages to their dates reported greater fulfilment than those who did not.\nPerhaps that was stating the obvious, but it had not occurred to me that communication, even when it is in the form of short text messages, is key to strong relationships.\nAt this stage in my life, I was trying to move around many big pieces of my life in the first few years after graduating from university. I was figuring out if I was in the right career, thinking of moving out from home, and contemplating shifting from my faith community.\nSo when I kept trying to find a partner, I was not prepared to put in the work.\nAnd so, I’ve accepted that being uncommunicative with my dates was another failure on my part.\nI still haven’t gotten a girlfriend.\nYet as I reflect on my journey so far, a few lessons come to mind.\nWhat if being “ready” for dates is impossible?\nThere’s a school of thought that says that you should work on yourself, before finding dates.\nBut after my recent experiences in the dating scene, I don’t think there’s ever a right time to be the perfect partner for that special someone.\nInstead, I see the experience of dating as an important part of growth, helping me know what I seek in a partner and how to correct the failings I have.\nIt is also about knowing how to pick yourself up to try again.\nIn April 2023, when I was window shopping, I had a conversation with a shop assistant. She was funny, clever, and insightful.\nWhen another shopper came in, I took a deep breath and asked her for her number.\nThere was a pause. Then she said: “I already have a partner, but you’re always welcome to come by to chat”.\nThat rejection hurt, although it shouldn’t have. It was nothing against me. She was attached, and didn’t want to lead me on.\nBut somehow, I was left hurting from that incident for a few days.\nThe bitterness reminded me of the many times I had been rejected not just by potential dates, but also in school, in job applications, and elsewhere.\nRejections hurt especially when they go against our fundamental desires, and makes us question what is wrong with ourselves.\nBut I think there’s truth in the Japanese proverb “fall down seven times, rise eight.”\nI wish there was a better answer than to just try again. But there isn’t. \nBecause finding success in love isn’t just about giving dates another chance. \nYes, it’s about taking the effort to know them through text, even when you think that it feels like a waste of time. Yes, it’s about being patient, even when the date doesn’t seem ready to progress. \nBut maybe, it’s also about giving yourself another chance, to keep dating, even when you’re losing hope.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nJohn Lim speaks on creating happier workplaces for millennials and is the author of the book Vault: Every Gen Z’s Guide to Getting Through the Swap of Adulting.

            "Article Body": "Since primary school, I have always felt like I was an underperformer relative to my peers. \nI’ve tried hard to become a better student, but academic excellence simply eluded me.\nThe struggles got worse in secondary school. Owing to my poor results in Secondary Two and Three, I suffered the ignominy of having to be retained for two consecutive years. \nAs everyone else moved ahead in life, I was stuck playing catch up. It was extremely demoralising watching my classmates and friends progress while I stayed behind.\nIn the end, I did manage to earn my N-Level certification. However, I had reached a point where I was no longer motivated to continue pursuing the academic route.\nIt goes without saying that my parents were worried about my future, but at least there was a safety net for me.\nAfter all, we have a thriving family business in the shipping industry, and as the only child, my parents expected that the business would be passed to me at some point in time.\nBut I had other ambitions.\nDuring my National Service in the Singapore Police Force, I did a serious soul-searching on what I was truly passionate about and what I was going to do with my life.\nI was, and still am, a big fan of everything to do with cars. There’s something about the combination of engineering, design, and performance packaged within a vehicle which has always fascinated me.\nSo, the idea of joining the automotive industry and becoming a car mechanic kept recurring to me. \nFor someone who isn’t academically inclined, a hands-on job working on car repair, maintenance, modification and diagnosis carried plenty of appeal.\nWith my academic grades, I know I will never have the chance to become a doctor and save lives, but perhaps I could learn how to cure a “sick” car instead and give it a new lease of life.\nOnce my National Service was over in 2017, it was time to make a decision about what career path I would embark on. \nThere was certainly plenty to think about as I still had many lingering doubts. For one, my parents reminded me that I had a duty to continue the family business. \nDid I really want to pursue a career that others still typecast as “grease monkeys”, or thought of as a dead-end job?\nIn the end, I decided to follow my heart. I went ahead to submit an application to enrol in the Nitec Automotive Technology Traineeship Programme by Institute of Technical Education (ITE). \nWhile waiting for the application result, I felt like if I was going to be working with cars my whole life, I should start getting acquainted with them.\nI signed up to become a private hire vehicle (PHV) driver. It gave me the flexibility and autonomy that I sought for in a job, plus the fact that I get to operate and control a car for hours on the road, which I enjoyed.\nIt also helped that the money wasn’t too bad either. But I was determined not to remain stuck in gig work as a PHV driver. \nI was surprised to read how a study by the Institute of Policy Studies last year found that a third of food delivery riders do not want to move out of delivery work at all, a sign that some people are entrenched in gig work.\nWhile this study was about food delivery, I can see how PHV drivers could become similarly stuck.\nTo me, I wasn’t content for long as a PHV driver as I did not feel enriched by the experience. \nI really wasn’t learning any intricate skills and knowledge on vehicle design, performance and modifications. \nBut the earnings allowed me to purchase my first car, a Renault Megane Red Bull Edition, which led me towards a semi-obsession of learning how to improve and maintain cars.\nMy entire day would be spent obsessing over wheels, suspension arms, coilovers, exhaust and gearbox tuning improvements. That was when I found my moment of clarity and decided to commit to a car mechanic career.\nThe reaction from my family and friends was predictably negative. \nThey had always considered my desire to become a car mechanic as a form of youthful recklessness, which would eventually go away and I would conform to their expectations of becoming a second generation business owner. \nSome couldn’t imagine me turning my back on a nice, comfortable job. \nFriends were incredulous that I was giving up the chance to run the family business to do physical work and get my hands dirty.\nIt was up to me to prove that I had made the correct choice. I signed up to be part of the ITE Traineeship Programme.\nTruth be told, the initial stages were tougher than I expected. \nAs a trainee starting from scratch in 2018 at Motor Edgevantage, my wages were mediocre when compared with what I earned during my PHV days. I also had to spend long hours on my feet at the workshop, while also having to attend my other ITE classes.\nI also struggled to understand my colleagues speaking in Chinese dialects, which I did not know.\nBut I was driven by my passion. Despite these obstacles, I was finally happy to be doing something that I relished.\nHearing the raw powerful musical notes that the internal combustion engine makes after I’ve completed servicing a vehicle makes me truly happy, and I think it is an experience that every true car enthusiast would love. \nMy hard work paid off when I received the SR Nathan Book Prize Award, which is awarded annually to the top 25 performing trainees from ITE. \nIt was a key turning point for me, because my family saw this as an official recognition that I had put in effort in my chosen career path and that it wasn’t just a youthful pursuit. I am thankful that they are more supportive of my choice today.\nAt the same time, they also realise that my job isn’t a dead-end, because there are many ways I can develop myself in the automotive industry.\nAt Motor Edgevantage, the Sin Ming Drive car workshop where I now work at, I am put on a structured career development plan in which my career progression is clearly mapped out, and had the opportunity to spend a week in Germany for training at Motoren Technik Mayer, a car tuning company.\nAfter all, nothing stays stagnant in an industry on the move. With the reality of electric cars now upon us and autonomous driving arriving in the near future, servicing cars will require a high level of technical expertise and usage of diagnostic software. \nI hope that perhaps then, the job will be seen as a well-respected career choice.\nIn addition to my daily duties as a tuning specialist, I also help mentor the new trainees in the company, who remind me a lot of myself: Full of enthusiasm but also uncertain about whether their career choice was the right one.\nI often tell them we have no control over people choosing to stereotype us as lowly educated grease monkeys. What we can control is our own commitment to this journey. Put in maximum effort, never stop learning and enjoy the process.\nIt makes me happy to have the opportunity to walk this path with them, overcoming challenges and celebrating success together.\nI still get asked if I have any regrets over my career choice but I don’t dwell on the past. \nKeep your eyes on the road ahead and don't ever look back, as the saying goes. That’s how I’ll continue to approach life.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nNicholas Lee, 27, is a tuning specialist at car workshop Motor Edgevantage."

            "Article Body": "Unlike the typical Singaporean kid, I was homeschooled for almost all my educational journey since kindergarten. \nMy parents initially chose this path to provide me with a less stressful and more personalised educational experience compared to traditional schooling. \nEven though I had the option to transition to a conventional school after completing my PSLE exams, I remained committed to homeschooling. \nHomeschooling allowed me to enjoy studying while pursuing my hobbies, such as writing and reading. This unconventional approach not only made learning enjoyable during my growing years, but also instilled in me the discipline to manage my time effectively.\nThroughout my homeschooling years, I used relevant curriculum programmes from the United States, which has a more widely established homeschooling scene. I learnt through pre-recorded videos and remote grading by American teachers. \nUpon completing my Primary School Leaving Examinations in 2015, I felt ready to become more independent in my studies.\nBut plans changed when the Covid-19 pandemic hit.  \nMy aspirations to attend university were put on hold when the College Board in the United States discontinued SAT subject tests globally due to the pandemic. I considered Advanced Placement exams, but the lack of prior exposure to relevant courses left me hesitant to continue pursuing self-studies. \nHaving heard of other homeschoolers taking the polytechnic route to university instead, I decided to do so as well.\nAs an avid writer and reader, human behaviour and psychology has always interested me. Thus, I chose to apply to Republic Polytechnic (RP) and secured a spot in the Diploma in Consumer Behaviour & Research course with the US high school diploma from my homeschooling programme.\nTransitioning from homeschooling to a polytechnic setting was initially daunting.  \nThough my experience with co-curricular activities and supportive social circles had equipped me with essential communication skills throughout my homeschooling years, I’m still an introvert at heart. \nI was afraid of entering a new and unfamiliar environment, one where I would be learning alongside classmates. What if I wasn’t able to get along with them?\nDespite my initial apprehension, I was very excited to develop new friendships at polytechnic, even though I was not the most outgoing person. The pandemic had created some “pent-up social needs” in me, as the multiple extended lockdowns had prevented me from attending co-curricular activities and seeing friends in person. \nInstead of focusing on my worries, I set my sights on embracing opportunities to make new friends and catching up quickly in my learning pursuits. I told myself that I would try to be as friendly as possible to every classmate I met. \nI’ve always been pretty articulate and I had no problems speaking up in class, so I was able to perform well in class participation.\nThat said, I was touched whenever my mentor in RP checked in to make sure that I was making friends and adapting well, and to answer my questions on IT matters and school fees. \nDespite the encouraging start, my polytechnic journey was not always smooth sailing. Even so, I tried to see each challenge as an opportunity for growth. \nDaily graded assignments were part of the grind, which I was not used to — while homeschooling, only tests, quizzes, and certain assignments had been graded. But my passion for writing proved extra helpful in staying on top of them.\nThe rigorous demands of regular group projects and presentations allowed me to develop new levels of endurance, confidence, and effective communication skills.\nI particularly enjoyed modules on people and psychology as I’ve always been fascinated by how people think and how their thoughts affect their actions. \nAcademics aside, poly life also offered me many other precious experiences and opportunities for broadening my horizons even further.\nIn my third year, I got an internship opportunity at a leading market research company, NielsenIQ.\nGetting to learn more about people from the marketing perspective was so exciting, and I even got to participate in the conduct of real-world market research. \nThe internship taught me more about how to communicate professionally and effectively with colleagues and to be more confident in my own abilities as I continued to grow my knowledge.\nAfter that, I had the opportunity to serve as a student leader on an international service learning trip to Batam, where we taught local kindergartners basic lessons in Mathematics, English, dance, and sports. \nDuring the trip, we had to improvise due to the language barrier. It was the first time I’d had the opportunity to reflect on how learning English can be a different experience for non-native speakers.\nThis was a valuable experience that showed me how my skills and knowledge could be put towards making a positive impact on communities in need.\nAll in all, as much as I had enjoyed homeschooling, it was fun to have classmates for once. The workload in RP could be tough at times, but working alongside friends made it more manageable.\nI graduated from RP on May 7, 2024.\nLooking back, my polytechnic experience turned out to be a transformative journey. Despite my initial concerns about the forced deviation from my original education plans, transiting to “normal” schooling had provided me with invaluable lessons, diverse experiences and meaningful connections.\nAll of these have profoundly shaped my growth both as a student and as a person. \nThe most impactful aspect of my experience at RP was the confidence I developed. It helped me not to fear changes and challenges, but to have faith in my own abilities.  \nI also learnt how important companionship could be on a big journey like education. While homeschooling worked for me, it could also get pretty lonely at times as I didn’t have anyone to discuss my work or progress with. \nBeing in RP was a good change for me, as I got to work alongside peers, and discuss and exchange ideas with them. It was nice to feel like I was part of a group. \nPost-graduation, I intend to pursue a degree in Linguistics, driven by my fascination with the intricacies of language. \nWhatever path I choose, I know that many more opportunities for growth await me. \nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nArista Loh, 20, recently graduated from Republic Polytechnic with a diploma in consumer behaviour & research. She has a passion for writing and strives to become a better writer every day."

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "My issues with my appearance first started during puberty. \nI had gone through the regular cycle of a growth spurt, marked by big changes in my height and weight; but nothing could’ve prepared me for how much my bust would grow. \nIn Primary 5, a classmate looked at me and said, “Dude, I can see your boobs. They’re so obvious, did you wear a bra?” \nI had, of course, worn a bra — but the embarrassing call-out opened my eyes to notice, for the first time, that my bust was larger than everyone else’s. I also noticed that my thighs had become thicker; the skinny, pre-puberty body I had was gone. \nIt clicked in my head that the way I looked could be an uncomfortable sight in the eyes of those around me because it went against the grain of Southeast Asian beauty standards. \nI had always been encouraged by my mum to embrace how I looked and be comfortable in my own skin. But from this point on, I suddenly realised how societal beauty standards place us all under intense scrutiny and pressure, even at such a young age. \nOver the next few years, it became more and more apparent that my figure was different. \nBeing heavily invested in fashion, I was acutely conscious of how certain clothes would look on me and the reactions it could warrant. I would pay attention to the forecasted designs from fashion week and other catalogues or style icons of the mid- to late 2010s. \nLabels like Brandy Melville caught my eye, a trendsetting brand known for catering to ultra-skinny girls. Each time I visited the store with friends, I would wait outside the changing room and look at them trying on piece after piece, thinking of how these pretty clothes could never look good on me. \nIn my naivety, I thought that the style icons of the time — Gigi Hadid, Blake Lively, Kylie Jenner — set the standard of what women should aspire to look like. I strived to replicate their outfits and appearances. Pop culture influences such as these illustrated the silhouette that I “should” have. \nIt was impossible, no matter how many diets or exercise regimes I tried. \nOne reason why is that my body looked good the way it was. I wasn’t overweight; I just wasn’t the size-zero model you see on magazine covers or when you’re shopping online. Any professional stylist would also tell you that the type of wardrobe that is suitable for you is very dependent on your figure and your features. \nWhile I understood the concept, I struggled to actively apply it. \nFor my 18th birthday, I wanted to wear a gingham-patterned crop top purchased for the occasion. When I tried it in-store, it seemed to fit — but on the day itself, my reflection seemed foreign, and thoughts of how I despised the way I looked swirled in my head. I felt “unworthy” of pretty clothes. \nAll through ages 18-22, I embarked on various diet plans and exercise regimes to achieve a figure that I could be happy with. \nIt worked out most of the time, but whatever results I obtained came at the cost of my health. There were days I would forgo entire meals just to feel “healthier”. This was a short-term solution, of course, because I would always find newer problems to pick at: ‘My nose is not small enough’, ‘My jawline can be sharper’, ‘My tummy is not flat enough after meals’.\nIn the last few years, the world has seen an increased representation of women with a variety of body shapes and types in the media, like Kat Dennings and Ashley Graham. Such representation encouraged me to work harder on positively affirming my body and the way I looked. \nI took up pilates, each session of which concluded with the instructor inviting us into a moment of gratitude for our bodies taking us through the exercise and for all it does. \nThese helped me forge a more wholesome mirror through which to see myself: “I’m thankful I have a tummy that protects vital organs like my uterus,” I started to think. “My thicker thighs support me during muscle training.”\nBit by bit, I managed to build a newfound confidence that made me feel more beautiful. I learnt that I am healthy and uniquely me, and any modification to my looks should be an enhancement of myself, rather than a “necessary” improvement. \nConfession: Despite the strides I’ve made, I still struggle from time to time — when I’m bloated after a meal, for example, or indulging in unhealthy snacks when I have not been working out for a while.      \nI take a longer look in the mirror to identify my “flaws” and how to get rid of them. Sometimes, I even have a difficult time leaving the house, because the thought of putting on an outfit that can make me feel good is a heavy weight (no pun intended). \nWhat helps a lot is remembering that being loved is so much more important than being skinny — my friends and family remind me of this every time they tell me I look beautiful even when I am overthinking an outfit.\nThrough social media platforms like TikTok, I’ve been able to see so many women of different shapes and sizes and know that my struggles with my body is a shared, universal experience. It’s comforting to see styling videos where a girl might have a bit of a tummy like me wearing a low-waist skirt, or a busty girl donning a top that heavily accentuates her curves. \nI’ve come a long way, but I’m still a work in progress. What I can share is this: If you’re struggling like me, it helps to first redefine beauty for yourself. \nTo me, beauty is no longer about a number on a scale; it’s about presenting the best version of myself to the world and doing what makes me feel good. If a simple jeans and T-shirt combination is what makes me feel comfortable, I know that I am gorgeous.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nLarissa Santhana Nair, 23, makes sense of life and its complexities through song, dance and the occasional burrito.

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "My partner and I crossed paths towards the end of 2019, while studying at different universities in Edinburgh, Scotland.\nWe were set apart from the start: He’s from Malaysia, and I’m from Singapore. But we didn’t expect to be parted from each other so soon.\nWe spent just two months together before the Covid-19 pandemic struck, forcing us back to our home countries. \nThus began a 15-month stretch of long-distance dating, divided into two legs — one from March to September 2020, and another from May 2021 to January 2022.\nHaving never visited each other’s cities, we struggled to visualise each other’s daily lives and relied heavily on video calls and photographs. But even with modern technology, connection across physical separations cannot be guaranteed. \nCountless conversations got cut short due to poor Wi-Fi or last-minute plans. Given that we hadn’t spent much time together in person, virtual communication proved tricky as we were not used to each other’s tones and reactions, which sometimes caused frustration and disappointment — the core of which was a sense of disconnection and a desire to hash it out in person. \nCoupled with the uncertainties of the ongoing pandemic, there were times it felt tortuous and never-ending.\nOn the flip side, being closed off from the outside world made us more open and vulnerable with each other. Early in the relationship, we set boundaries, discussed fears and anxieties, and swapped childhood stories.\nIn September 2020, Singapore’s borders with Malaysia were tightly shut and would stay so until 2022.\nWe chose to spend the next eight months continuing our studies together in Scotland. But the reunion, though long-awaited, initially felt bittersweet and strange. After becoming accustomed to seeing and hearing each other through video and flattened digital transmissions, meeting in person felt almost like encountering a stranger.\nWe had to get accustomed to physical habits and relearn routines, both our own and each other’s. It also felt like we had a silent agreement to cherish the limited time together. After all, we didn’t know when the next bout of long distance would start again.\nTruth be told, this made for a lot of particularly hard, isolated days during this time — but I wouldn’t exchange the toughest of these for anything. It taught me not to take things for granted, not even mundane things like getting groceries or doing laundry together.\nStill, doubts lingered in my mind: With him graduating and returning to Malaysia while I still had a year left in Scotland, how long would this last? Even if we did make it through all that, how were we going to eventually close the gap?\nWhen the eight months were up, it was a harder goodbye because there was no end in sight. I knew this second round of long-distance was going to be even tougher than the first.\nI was in my final year of university, with assignments, exams and my dissertation at their most intense. My partner found a job in Malaysia that took up much of his time. Further complicating things was an eight-hour time difference, which we had to spend much of our limited free time contending with and working around. \nThroughout it all, the uncertainty of when we could bridge the geographical gap between us weighed heavily on our minds.\nWe learned the importance of compromise, putting effort into changing our routines in order to match up free times, and communicating as much as possible. We made intentional efforts to strengthen our bond: Virtually meeting each other’s families, sharing an account for updates on days we couldn’t talk, and even starting a “count-up” log to track our time apart, which motivated us to keep going on difficult days. \nWe scheduled date nights — and didn’t skimp on them either, indulging in multiplayer Steam games, karaoke sessions, movie nights on platforms like Scener, and sending gifts and food to each other’s families.\nWe also started getting on Skype calls not to talk, but to leave a window of connection open as we went about our routines, allowing us to share mundane aspects of our lives with each other and building our shared intimacy in a way that did not impede our schedules and commitments.\nUpon graduating, I returned to Singapore in May 2022. The opening of Singapore's borders with Malaysia in December 2021 had also brought a profound sense of relief. While the physical separation remained, knowing that we were no longer restricted by closed borders was a big load off our minds.\nMy partner quickly secured a job in Singapore and moved here, a transition that presented brand new challenges: From balancing family visits in both countries to making decisions about settling down and housing arrangements, all while striving for a work-life balance.\nBeing in the same city brought comfort, allowing us to explore each other's childhood neighbourhoods, meet each other's families and friends, and immerse ourselves in each other's lives and cultures.\nDespite my partner’s constant reassurances, the sacrifices he’s made to leave his home country for mine weigh on me. He can't see his family and friends as frequently as before, and misses significant events like birthdays and funerals.\nOn my end, I try to help him plan out his leaves and flights, and accompany him whenever he goes back to Malaysia — aiming to support him while building stronger connections with his family.\nDating long-distance for as long as we did definitely affected our relationship, especially at such a young age. But it made a lot of positive impact too. \nOne example is the evolution of our communication: Moments where we struggled to understand each other's tone and body language taught us to share our thoughts and feelings with each other more directly and openly.\nOur long-distance stints have also underscored the importance of a strong foundation and friendship in a romantic relationship. Without a mutual commitment to building a strong emotional bond and supporting each other through hard days, any obstacles — geographical distance included — can feel overwhelming.\nWe're fortunate that our families have been incredibly supportive from the beginning, taking time to get to know each other over meals and consistently prioritising our needs and aspirations. It couldn't have been easy for them to watch us embark on this journey amid the uncertainties of the pandemic.\nAny long-distance relationship isn't easy, whether it’s romantic or otherwise — but they also offer plenty of opportunities that would be impossible in a “conventional” relationship. If you keep the faith and hope, the distance stops being a hindrance and becomes an incredible means of deeper connection.\nAs for me, I’ve stopped fixating on the obstacles in my way. Instead, I’m choosing to focus on how we’re going to overcome them together.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nNicole Chan, 24, is a communications strategist by trade, and a digital native by passion.

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "Growing up, I’d always felt limited in buying new things. My family was financially comfortable but never rich, and my mother had to keep a tight hand on our purse strings at times. \nUpon becoming a working adult, receiving a pay cheque and controlling how it’s used was an immeasurably exciting concept. \nStarting out, I was uncompromisingly thrifty with my hard-earned money. I used Grab rides and food delivery services only for work; I did most of my shopping on Shopee and Shein; I ate out twice a week at most, keeping it to a maximum of S$30 each time. \nBut the rigidity eventually tired me out. Endlessly scrolling through TikToks of people living their best Eat, Pray, Love lives convinced me that I should make the most out of my youth and create the life I desire. \nMoney, I fatefully decided, can be earned back — but not vibes.\nI wasted no time in changing my lifestyle accordingly: I used ride-hailing services whenever I felt like it, and at least one new piece of clothing was added to my wardrobe every week. I became a magpie – except that it didn’t have to be shiny to catch my eye and get me to open my wallet! \nSure, I would still try to save about S$200 a month, but any savings I accumulated screamed “extra spending” to me — which would eventually lead me to a financial rock bottom. \nI was on holiday in Melbourne this October enjoying the cold spring weather, the many thrift shopping options, and the delicious coffee and food. \nRunning low on spending money, I pulled up my banking app to transfer money into my travel e-wallet and stared in dismay at my phone: I had only S$20 left in my account. \nThankfully, I had extra cash on hand to tide me through to the next day, when I received my salary. But that new pay cheque did not last as long as it should have: Come Nov 1, I found myself yet again facing the exact same conundrum. \nWith only S$400 left until the next payday, I was anxious about how I’d survive the next three weeks. What about team lunches during work-from-office days? How would I afford transportation? \nI also found myself grappling with a fear I’ve never known before: This was the very first time in all 23 years of my life that I did not have a cushion of savings that I or my family could rely upon in an emergency. I berated myself for not being more prudent the months before.\nWhile I could blame a culture of consumerism, I admit that there really is something so comforting in buying something when you are having a tough time — after all, it’s called retail “therapy” for a reason.\nBut treating myself for tackling day-to-day tasks or just because “I deserve it” had turned into such a normalised coping mechanism that it had become unquestioningly harmful to my financial and mental health. \nThe self-control I’d exercised since childhood was switched off for such a short period of time, but had come so close to wrecking my life. \nI knew I had no time to waste. Immediately, I started budgeting for the rest of the month. \nInstead of eating Italian fusion food from a Tipo restaurant (about S$25), I headed to Saizeriya for my pasta fix (S$8).\nI forced myself to wake up half an hour earlier for work and scheduled all meetings 15 minutes earlier than I needed to be there in my personal calendar, and managed to avoid resorting to cabs and Grabs. \nDigging through my mountain pile of clothes, I resignedly listed the ones I knew I could instantly earn cash from on Carousell. I made S$20 in a week, financing two work-from-office meals. \nMore importantly, I embarked on a ‘No Buy November’ ban till my next pay cheque. This meant I had to turn a blind eye to the typical bevy of sales launched during this month — 11.11, Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and more. \nFrankly, I thought this would be impossible. My friends, while supportive, had a hard time believing I would be able to persevere through it as well. \nTo my surprise, this new mission became an eye-opener for me: I learnt that I can appreciate an item — bags, jewellery, even simple things like stationery — without spending money on it. \nThe one silver lining of my shopaholic tendencies? All the CapitaStar points I’d racked up went towards necessary toiletries. It inspired me to become a full-fledged “auntie” and start collecting points on other platforms with benefits. \nMy crisis management measures paid off. I made it to my next payday — with S$30 to spare.\nThroughout my no-buy ban, I saw multiple items I desperately wanted to buy in the moment — but looking back now, I cannot specifically name a single one. \nThis brought me to another revelation: On rough days, I feel justified to shop freely because I want to feel better, but with such impulse purchases, the rush of joy is only fleeting. I did not actually want the item I bought — rather, I liked the idea that I could have it. \nFollowing my brush with financial ruin, I resolved to turn my bad money habits around. \nI became diligent in tracking my expenses throughout the month with a handy Notion template. Its clear and neat categorisations help me easily understand how and where I’m spending my money. \nThis also helps me pare down on unnecessary costs. For example, this showed me that I’ve been subscribed to certain services that no longer benefit me and it might be time to end them. \nA friend of mine has a “shopping risk analysis” system, calculating each item’s cost per wear: If a bag costs S$45 and can be used at least 45 times, the “value” of that bag is approximately S$1. If an item’s “value” does not hit close to S$1, he shelves the idea of buying it. I keep this in mind now whenever something catches my eye.\nI still buy things I want — but not all of them, and no longer on impulse. \nWhen you have a goal or purpose for your savings, it helps make the scrimping worthwhile. With a dream to move abroad someday, I definitely need a good amount of savings to fall back on.\nThis may sound like a contradiction to what I’ve shared so far, but there is undoubtedly a beauty in shopping and treating yourself — when done in moderation. Each of us have our own personal style and character, and there’s no harm in expressing these in the clothes we don or the little trinkets we put up on our shelves and walls. \nHowever, I’ve learnt that responsible spending is about embracing personal style while resisting the urge to conform. Social media continues to expose me to a never-ending parade of shiny new microtrends and aesthetics, but I now understand that appreciating them does not mean I have to adopt them all. \nReal talk: I don’t think I will ever completely eradicate frivolous consumerism from my life — but I can confidently say that its hold on me has drastically weakened. \nWith good planning and intentionality, it’s possible for me to shop consciously and authentically express myself without breaking the bank.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nLarissa Santhana Nair, 23, makes sense of life and its complexities through song, dance and the occasional burrito.

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "Every Jan 1 in the Yamato-Leow household, soft and chewy mochi will be placed on the dining table at home – part and parcel of my family’s tradition in welcoming the Japanese New Year, also known as Oshogatsu.\nAnd typically about a month later, my household awakens to vibrant hues of red and gold as well as inverted “fu” calligraphy decorations adorning our walls, as the Chinese side of my family celebrates the Lunar New Year.\nIt is through these traditions and festivals that I am constantly reminded of how closely intertwined my Japanese and Chinese roots are. \nBut as I grew up, I am often asked which part of my heritage I identify with more.\nI learnt as a young girl how complex the concept of identity is, growing up as a Singaporean-Japanese who has also lived for a time in the United States, China and Canada, before finally moving here 14 years ago.\nToday, I understand that humans are not monolithic creatures and it is never about choosing one culture over the other. \nYet, as a kid, there were moments I felt confused as to who I was, especially when I lived in places where there were certain cultural expectations and stereotypes. \nFor example, while I was living in Singapore, the accent I picked up from living in the US and going to international schools in China led most people to assume that I wasn’t Singaporean. Conversely, when I travelled to North America, I would get compliments like “Your English is really good!”. Naturally, as a child, I would get confused about what parts of me I was meant to identify with. \nI’ve learnt that when it comes to being at peace with my dual heritage, it's not about looking at the differences between my Singaporean and Japanese backgrounds or the cultural environment I grew up in, but being able to embrace how different cultures can have amazing similarities.\nSuch as the case with the Japanese and Chinese New Years, which have similar practices such as the giving of hongbaos and or \"otoshidama\" (\"lucky money\" in Japanese) in red packets from elders to children.\nI know that I didn't belong to only one world, but I had the privilege to dip my toes into both.\nBecause I was brought up to appreciate the rich diversity of peoples and cultures around the world, I would bring that spirit with me during my travels, constantly going off the beaten track to learn more about how other people live.\nInstead of attractions that occupy the usual tourist itineraries and sit on Top 10 lists, I found myself gravitating towards places that represent the diverse heartbeat of the city or town that I was in.\nI loved the suburban Vietnamese restaurants in the US, the park playgrounds near family friends’ houses, the (super-sized) bags of snacks in grocery stores, and the various watering holes where serendipitous encounters and varied conversations happen.\nI also sought out unique experiences as a solo traveller, recently visiting Spain, Japan and Vietnam on my own.\nAs a young adult, solo travel was never about getting away, but about understanding myself better, to push boundaries and face fears head-on. Each trip is an introspection and an opportunity to grow. \nTo help travellers discover and understand the cultural significance of attractions, I worked together with a team of fellow travel and tech enthusiasts to develop Wunderguide, an artificial intelligence tour guide that helps save hours of sifting through reviews, websites, and maps across multiple apps. \nIt was this yearning to immerse oneself into the pulse of every destination that we decided to create Wunderguide not just as another travel tool, but as a bridge to help travellers easily find answers to their questions and understand their destinations.\nNevertheless, the best experiences are often spontaneous, as I’ve found. Last July, I found myself travelling to the vast steppes of Mongolia.\nThere, I would discover a wordless form of human connection while staying in a traditional ger, the yurt-like dwelling that has housed nomads for centuries.\nEvery communication with my nomadic hosts involved a tentative dance of gestures and smiles. In spite of this language hurdle, we were able to understand each other.\nWhat made the difference was the mutual desire on both sides to share aspects of our own culture, which was a kind of universal language of its own.\nThat mutual connection was how I was able to try my hand at the age-old practice of shearing a sheep with a pair of scissors. \nWhile I was clumsy in my first few attempts, my hosts responded to my earnest desire to learn their ways, and instructed me kindly as if they were teaching their own daughter how to survive in the wild plains.\nApart from the occasional laughter from the hosts when I made a mistake, there was mostly just a lot of silent gesturing. But I could sense that they shared my happiness when I finally learned the ropes.\nAdmittedly, all I had to offer in return was some of my snacks and coffee from my previous trip to South Korea, but they later returned the favour by inviting me to share with them a traditional meal of khorkhog, a type of stone-grilled meat.\nTo me, it felt like I was learning meaningfully and being accepted by another culture other than my own. Beyond the boundaries of being Singaporean or Japanese, I felt like someone more.\nMy visit to the Mongolian countryside has since become a core memory. As a 23-year-old who is now back amidst the familiar hum of urban life, I have been reflecting on my experience in the ger, trying to integrate what I learnt into my daily life. \nI’ve come to the realisation that travel is not about the miles covered, but the memories made and the life lessons picked up along the way. \nFor one, I've made an effort to be more patient, taking the time to connect with those around me even if the first step is the hardest. \nI’ve also tried to temper my urge to seek out instant gratification and be more mindful, remembering the peaceful solitude and the timeless nature of the grassy plains of Mongolia. \nI will also not forget the importance of observing and listening as opposed to filling silence with chatter, because sometimes silence can speak volumes.\nFor my fellow female solo travellers, there will of course be some trepidation being so far away from home on our own.\nApart from the oft-cited and correct advice of doing proper research beforehand about cultural norms and keeping trusted ones informed about your movements, there are also ways for female travellers to not let fear hinder genuine experiences.\nFor one, opting for homestays can be wise, as staying with local family hosts provides an intimate glimpse into the region's lifestyle and traditions.\nConnecting with other travellers also helps –  platforms like Hostelworld can help you meet other travellers. For many cities, there are Facebook groups that cater specifically to female travellers.\nIt goes without saying that safety is paramount, which is why having a friendly face in the vicinity is key.\nWhether it is the vibrant canals of Amsterdam, the bucolic Mongolian countryside, hectic Hong Kong or the tranquil streets of San Sebastian, I firmly believe that solo travel doesn't mean travelling alone.\nRather, it means interacting more with locals who can come from vastly different backgrounds. Doing so can enrich our own life and help us figure out our own place in the world.\nAfter all, identity isn't a static entity sealed within predefined societal boxes decided from birth.\nI may be Japanese and Chinese, but my identity is also the sum of all the places I've lived in and travelled to, like a patchwork of experiences and memories that define me as a person.\nAnd each step I take into a new place or a new experience enlarges this rich tapestry by weaving in new threads, including those made from Mongolian wool.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nAmelia Yamato Leow, 23, is a Business Analytics major with a love for travel, nature, and culinary adventures. Her weekends are often a blend of family gatherings, hangouts with friends, playing with her dog, working on Wunderguide, and reading a new book.

I feel sure the day will come when you can say: this is my life.” "

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "Growing up in Singapore, my life has been a colourful tapestry of diverse cultures and languages.\nMy journey has been one of self-discovery, introspection, and a profound appreciation for racial harmony.\nFrom enjoying various cuisines at hawker centres to celebrating festive occasions with friends of different ethnic and religious groups, I am thankful for living in a diverse country that celebrates multiculturalism.\nBut for those with complex ancestry like me, who find ourselves at the intersection of different cultures, it is often the case that we have to grapple with the complex concept of identity. \nYou see, my forefathers came from diverse backgrounds, including of Eurasian, Indian, and Peranakan origins. \nMy grandparents and great-grandparents lived in a typical Singaporean kampung and spoke Malay.\nOn the other hand, my maternal grandfather hailed from Pondicherry and was a Malayalee who spoke English, Malayalam, and Tamil. When he came to Singapore in the 1930s, he married my grandmother and picked up Malay conversationally. \nAnd so, while English became the sole language spoken at home by my entire family, I studied Malay in school, despite it being customary for most Indian students to learn Tamil in Singapore. \nLet me just say that I deeply appreciate how harmony between different races has been such an integral part of my family history and my own life.\nWith my mixed heritage, I take immense pride in my identity as an Indian girl. \nNevertheless, despite Singapore being multicultural, some people have found my background confusing.\nAlthough my South Asian roots primarily trace back to Tamil origins, like I said earlier, I do not speak the language.\nWhen I was younger, this caused an identity crisis for me. Unlike my friends who learned and spoke their mother tongues, and were thus able to connect with their culture through language, I couldn’t do the same.\nLanguage was just one aspect that contributed to my sense of being different. As Catholics, my family celebrates Easter and Christmas, and we do not observe Hindu festivals like Holi or Deepavali. \nI have been ridiculed for both my unfamiliarity with popular Bollywood music and films and my limited tolerance for spicy food.\nOver time, I became aware of some unfair judgements that people have made about my cultural background. \nIt troubled me greatly that my inability to speak Tamil or follow certain practices painted me as a “fake Indian”, and true enough, others have called me that before.\nI was deeply distressed by the thought of not holding up to the image that many people have about Indians. \nThankfully, I no longer hold such beliefs now. Just because I do not know how to speak Indian languages or follow cultural traditions does not make me less of an Indian. \nOver the years, I took it upon myself to learn more about Indian culture to deepen my connection with my heritage.\nThrough literature and university courses, I delved into the history of Indians in Singapore and the myriad traditions of different Indian groups such as Gujarati and Maharashtrian, I eagerly engaged my lecturers with questions that they have always graciously answered.\nFor example, I enrolled in a “South Asia in Singapore\" course at the National University of Singapore, where I learnt about the historical context and migration patterns of South Asians here spanning from the colonial era to the contemporary period. \nThe course underscored the remarkable diversity among South Asians in Singapore, highlighting variations in their origins, languages, and religious affiliations, thereby dispelling the notion of a homogeneous South Asian community.\nMoreover, I found joy in sharing my cultural journey with loved ones who have happily joined me in my visits to the museums and heritage trails. This year alone, I have visited the Indian Heritage Centre in Little India three times.\nParticipating in community events is also a wonderful way to connect with people from different backgrounds and understand different cultures. \nI regularly volunteer at my neighbourhood’s community club, and I have had the pleasure of teaming up with a diverse group of friends to create a music video for a Deepavali celebration.\nWe filmed in Little India, engaging with various shopkeepers, and immersing ourselves in their traditional trades. We embraced the spirit of Deepavali by dressing up in colourful ethnic costumes and partaking in the festivities.\nWe learned about the significance of Deepavali and the vibrant celebrations, such as preparing delicious delicacies like gulab jamun and creating Rangoli patterns using coloured powders to usher prosperity.\nAnother community event that gave me new insights were the Racial Harmony Day carnival celebrations on July 21, featuring an array of fun segments like musical performances and writing Chinese calligraphy. \nThese activities cultivated my appreciation for different cultures and revealed historical significance, like the Indian origin of Snakes and Ladders, also known as \"Parama Padam.\"\nFood stalls at the carnival offer beloved dishes from various cuisines, such as Chinese popiah and Peranakan laksa. \nIt is always heart-warming to watch others, regardless of ethnicity or religion, bonding and celebrating our multicultural society. \nSuch cultural exchange fosters a shared identity as Singaporeans. To me, this intermingling of cultures within the community is what creates a sense of belonging and strengthens social bonds.\nIt is what helps to nurture a unique Singaporean identity that is rooted in unity and acceptance.\nAt 23, with growing confidence and self-assurance in my identity, I learned that labelling individuals based on their languages or cultural practices is futile. \nInstead of labels, which serve to put people into boxes, I found that we should all welcome the idea of learning about one another's beliefs and practices because this  helps to dispel misconceptions and find common ground.\nToday, my passion for learning more about Indian culture has remained strong as I find that connecting with one's heritage is an ongoing and fulfilling process. \nDuring my summer break this year, I had the valuable opportunity to intern with the Singapore Indian Development Association (Sinda), a self-help group supporting the Indian community. \nMy days there gave me further insights into cultural activities and their significance. \nMy colleagues were touched by my desire to connect with my roots and taught me Tamil phrases eagerly, without any judgement that I wasn’t able to speak the language.\nSuch experiences not only deepened my understanding of Indian culture but also allowed me to share my background with others and fostered a mutual appreciation for different cultures. \nI firmly believe that racial harmony forms an essential aspect of the social defence pillar of Total Defence, as it strengthens social cohesion. By nurturing a sense of responsibility towards one another, we can all contribute to the well-being of the broader community and help build a united and strong Singapore.\nAlthough Racial Harmony Day is not officially observed at work or in tertiary educational institutions, I believe that it is necessary as it serves as a reminder to cherish the unique blend of cultures that coexist harmoniously in Singapore.\nIn Singapore, with its diverse individuals from various backgrounds, some of us may encounter instances of racism and discrimination.\nCelebrating racial harmony helps to foster appreciation for each other's traditions, values, and histories, enriching the tapestry of Singaporean society. It is a part of our daily lives. \n I believe this is how we can continue paving the way for a more inclusive and harmonious society.\nAs a mixed-heritage individual, my journey towards self-acceptance was made possible because I felt empowered to learn more about my own identity. \nI have come to appreciate the beauty of different cultures and recognise the importance of fostering understanding among my peers.\nIt has been a long journey but I am proud of who I am. \nLike my favourite Singaporean dish, rojak, I am a mix of various ingredients and spices, a vibrant amalgamation of cultures and traditions.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nDarcel Anastasia Al Anthony, 23, is a final-year student at the National University of Singapore."

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "Five years ago, everyone around me was in relationships and I decided that it was time for me to find a partner too.\nI was 20 then, and it occurred to me at the time that my social circle was relatively small. Even as someone who just exited her teenage years, my groups of friends consisted mainly of females from my school and my part-time jobs in F&B and retail.\nWhen I entered polytechnic, I didn’t develop any interest in the boys I met either.\nBy all accounts, I was a complete greenhorn in the dating scene.\nBut I knew that this status quo could not be the case, and so I started being on the lookout for someone to date. I wanted a partner who was mature in his thinking.\nCoupled with my lack of exposure to the wider workforce and insufficient opportunities to meet new people, I turned to dating apps to find a partner.\nBack then, my best friend encouraged me to download Tinder as she had met her then-boyfriend on the app.\nI wasn’t very familiar with the variety of dating apps but Tinder felt like a suitable platform for young adults like me who were looking to date.\nSince this was my first time, I didn’t want to overwhelm myself by using too many dating apps, and only focused on Tinder.\nThat being said, I was initially sceptical about using the platform, chiefly because I might be wasting time trying to build a relationship with someone who may not share the same relationship goals and values as I did.\nI also feared scams given reports about scammers preying on people looking for love on networking and dating apps.\nI’d heard stories that people on dating apps also use the platform to widen their social circles, but I was clear on my intention: to find a boyfriend who could eventually become my long-term partner.\nI wasn’t sure if I could find my perfect match on Tinder at the time, but I knew that I needed to get into the dating scene and be more proactive about finding someone special.\nSo, I embarked on my online dating journey with caution, keeping those considerations in mind and staying true to what I was looking for.\nI was attracted to guys who are kind, have a sense of humour, communicate well, are respectful of personal boundaries, and are filial to their parents. These were characteristics of someone who was “mature” in my books.\nA poll recently found that Generation Z believe that their partners and themselves have to be \"authentic\" when it comes to dating, while prioritising self-care and mental health.\nI also took the time to thoroughly read each person’s profile and only matched with them if they piqued my interest. This approach helped narrow down the pool of partners I was interested in.\nAt the same time, I was conscious not to judge the person’s character solely based on their images and choice of words presented on their profile.\nTo leave a good and authentic first impression on potential matches, I also put effort into crafting my profile, to make sure my online profile truly represented me.\nAnd so, that was how I met Samuel, my fiancé.\nI came across his profile a few days after using the app. His page gave me a glimpse of who he is as a person, and his Taiwan travel photos hinted that he was someone who enjoyed travel.\nSamuel started the conversation and we hit it off.\nWe continued conversing daily, sharing the details of our lives with each other, sending images of our meals and talking about our favourite activities. We would text every single day and he would also constantly check in to ensure that I reached home safely whenever I was out.\nBack when we were still chatting online, Samuel offered to buy lunch and deliver it to my house. I was cautious not to readily reveal my address just yet or to have our first in-real-life meet-up at my place, so I rejected his offer.\nIt was better to err on the side of caution, I thought. Looking back, I was glad Samuel didn’t walk away after this rejection. I needed to feel safe, and it helps that our first physical date took place in a crowded place that I was familiar with — a cafe I frequented.\nIn my case, I took a couple of months to get to know Samuel through our conversations via text before the meetup. We also exchanged social media handles, so I could get a better gauge of his personality and interests before deciding to meet him.\nWhat I learnt about him also gave us more topics to connect over. I felt confident about pursuing something further, and we arranged for our first date over brunch after two months of non-stop texting.\nIt was nerve-wracking as our date approached, as it was my first time meeting someone from an online platform, especially one who I was texting with for so long.\nAs a precaution, I informed my brother and best friend of my whereabouts.\nThankfully and fortunately so, the date went extremely well. We met every day after our initial date, going on walks together as it’s one of my favourite things to do. He eventually asked me to be his girlfriend two weeks later!\nWe’ve always been open about the fact that we met via a dating app. Our parents were initially surprised since dating apps were not a thing during their time, but they were open-minded and had no qualms after meeting and getting to know the other party in person.\nOur friends also commented that it was great that we had a platform to meet as our paths might not have ever crossed if not for dating apps, and that we subsequently built a healthy relationship.\nA relationship takes effort, even when it comes to the smallest of things. Our relationship worked out as both of us made continuous effort to sustain our conversations daily.\nTill today, we send each other “good morning” and “goodnight” texts, and even share about our meals on days that we don’t have the chance to meet up.\nThroughout our five-year-long relationship, Samuel and I have been able to continuously learn more about each other.\nIt definitely helps that we’re aligned on our values in life, and we still explore new experiences together as a couple — be it going to museums, hiking or attending fun pop-up events. Fast forward to today, we’ve since applied for a Build-to-Order flat and plan to get married in the next few years!\nLooking back at my journey, I know I was fortunate to have met the right partner by sheer chance on a dating app.\nI recognise that there might be many single men or women who aren’t as lucky to find the right person on an app, or are apprehensive about taking the relationship further.\nWhen I talk to my single friends about online dating, a common concern they have is their personal well-being and safety.\nBut I believe that it is possible to take precautions when using these apps and stay safe online.\nThe time it takes to feel comfortable with someone you meet online is not fixed for all. You don’t have to follow any timelines and will need to naturally warm up to them at your own pace.\nAnother word of advice for singles when conversing with matches they meet online is to act on your gut. I trust my own instincts, as they usually turn out to be right.\nInstincts aside, people should also be rational and listen to their heads, and not be blinded by the pink haze of prospective love.\nThis means adopting good practices, like notifying family members or close friends to check in with you after a date with someone you meet online.\nIf you sense a red flag, don’t hesitate to stop all contact and you can also block their profiles on the dating apps. If you feel like things are progressing too quickly, and the other party is going to great lengths to earn your trust and affection, be mindful enough not to be drawn into it.\nFor those who are considering online dating, it’s important to broaden your horizons, keep an open mind, be welcoming to new experiences, and stay safe.\nMost importantly, it is about being proactive in finding love. You never know what possibilities might be out there waiting for you, so why not give it a try?\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nJolyn Chang is a 26-year-old e-commerce executive. Outside of work, she enjoys spending quality time with her partner, including taking slow strolls as they explore the outdoors together."

            "Article Body": "Over the past 20 years of my life, I have held many jobs.\nI’ve loaded shipments, replenished groceries, and done stints in the media industry as a freelancer. But being a daughter and a caregiver to my sick mother was the first job I had, and it was the hardest.\nI am the only girl among my three brothers, so my natural nickname in my family was just \"Girl\". \nAs the third child, all the middle-child stereotypes of being rebellious were somehow not applicable to me, as I always acted as the peacemaker in the family.\nI was 16 when Mama was diagnosed with stage four colorectal cancer in June 2019. \nBeing her only daughter, she confided in me about everything. I was one of her best friends.\nWorking in so many odd jobs during my polytechnic years, I developed a sense of anxiety whenever I had nothing to do for a day and slowly became a workaholic.\nI would have production shoots or editing to do after school, and my weekends were spent holed up in a warehouse and then again crammed in my space to edit out videos and articles.\nI worked so much that I got burnt out and fell ill a lot. Mama was always so supportive, but still so worried about me. She always loved me no matter what, but I wanted her to be proud of me.\nMama passed away from cancer in March 2023, a week before her 52nd birthday. \nBefore she passed, Mama would say that she was going to see Nenek (Malay for grandmother) again. My late grandmother left us six years ago.\nEven till the end, she loved her Mak (Malay for mother) and wanted to spend more time with her.\nIt is the same for me, even though I spent the most time I had in her final years being her caregiver, and staying by her side.\nIt was the hardest job I ever had to do. However, I would do it all over again just to be with Mama.\nGrowing up, my mother was always like a superhero to us kids. But her bout with cancer let me see her vulnerable sides.\nA couple of days before my Mathematics O-Level examination in 2019, I brought her to her first chemotherapy session, after she had surgery a few months prior to remove her growing tumour. \nMy brothers were especially confident that she was going to be fine. But I knew how human she really was, and I knew that she was feeling anxious. \nIt was her first chemo and she panicked. She begged me to call the nurses because she couldn’t breathe. She never knew how to deal with her panic attacks, and I struggled trying to calm her down. \nShe clenched her fists to her chest, screaming, but nothing came out of her mouth. Mama was not a superhero, she was merely a human being who needed care and love. That was the first time I saw her give up. \nAlas, the first chemotherapy session was unsuccessful, and she never got to finish the cycle. It was too intense for her to deal with, and for the first time ever, she couldn’t do it. She never wanted to do it again. \nShe recovered post-chemo at home, in so much pain that she would stay in bed all day. \nI would incessantly peek through her ajar door to see her chest move, just so I knew she was alive and breathing before I left for my O-Level examinations. \nIt hurt me so much to see her in so much pain and have nothing to do to help her. Yet, even until her last breath, her only worry was the family she was leaving behind. \nEven when she was unwell and weak, she always made sure she did something, such as cleaning the house, like the neat freak that she was. She even told us to repair the plumbing in the kitchen when she was in her final days. \nIn 2021, we finally convinced her to go back to chemotherapy to try and fight the cancer when it spread to her liver. \nDespite these hospital visits, nothing worked. I saw her lose hope and drift away from me.\nI was still a full-time student then, with after-school activities and engagements. \nNeedless to say, I felt extremely guilty for not being there for her as much as I wanted to be. I accompanied her to as many hospital visits as I could, and I spent many lunches in the hospital.\nIt still wasn’t enough. \nShe fought the best that she could because she still had so much to live for.\nUntil we found out in December 2022 that no treatments were working anymore because her organs were failing by the day — the cancer had spread to her lungs and her heart. \nI was in my last semester as a year three mass communications student at Republic Polytechnic when I got the news. I always felt like I had the time to be with her, that I would have at least a few more years. \nStruggling with my last semester, I was back and forth between school and the hospital. Just like I did, the past three years of my life. I spent so much time in the hospital that I knew which floors had the better bathrooms. \nHowever, Mama requested that she spend her last days at home, which meant that she needed someone to be at home with her.\nI stepped up to be there for her, though I wasn’t the only one. Thankfully, a nurse from the Methodist Welfare Services would come weekly to check on Mama’s condition too.\nThe hospital also provided her with numerous bags of painkillers, including morphine and fentanyl, to help her manage her suffering. \nThere were a lot of different medications that had to be given at the times the patient needed them, and I had to learn them on the job. \nTo this end, the help I got from the hospice nurses was invaluable.  \nInitially, all she required were fentanyl patches that I had to switch out every three days. Over time, she gradually started to experience difficulty performing simple daily tasks like standing up or taking a shower. \nJaundice, caused by an increase in bilirubin in her blood as a result of her liver failing, caused her skin to turn yellower and yellower. \nThe nurse taught me how to administer various medications to relieve her pain. These episodes came frequently in the middle of the night, when Mama would scream in pain or when she was simply unable to breathe. \nBeing a caregiver was challenging enough, but it was especially difficult to watch as Mama deteriorated into a hollow body after each day. I couldn’t recognise my Mama anymore. \nFortunately, I had a lot of support from our family. Mama was well-loved, and everyone always said that there was no one she loved more than her children. She would side with us even if we were in the wrong. Mama had our backs, always. \nMama’s siblings, my uncles and aunts, came over very often to help me during the day. They wanted to spend as much time as they could with Mama, too. My two older brothers and my father also took turns helping me take care of her while I rested.\nThe nurses and doctors who came to visit Mama always had one thing to tell me: to take a break when I get tired and to share responsibilities with my family. \nMy father, too, was instrumental in this family-wide effort.\nHe was the one who mostly took over me when I got fatigued, and he wanted me to rest whenever I could. He was also the only one to stay at the hospital every single day by her side when she was last hospitalized. \nEven with so much help, I felt so guilty for saying I was exhausted.\nIt wasn’t just because of interrupted sleep but also because it was mentally draining. I was at her beck and call, night and day. I was bound to reach the point of burnout.\nI never wanted Mama to feel like a burden. One thing she hated was depending on others. She raised us to be independent on our two feet. \nOn the other hand, I was so tired. I worked so many jobs — as many as three part-time jobs during my second year in polytechnic. But taking care of her was much more painful and tiring than I thought. \nBefore I could reach burnout, I did what I never thought I would do.\nI asked for help. It wasn’t easy because Mama raised me to do things by myself. I requested that another caregiver take over at night while I got at least a few hours of sleep.\nHowever, she passed the following night.\nI saw my mother take her last breath as I held onto her hand tightly. I told her to let go, that we’d be okay. But at her last breath, I desperately hoped she took another. I couldn’t imagine my life without her. \nMany of my relatives and friends say the typical sentences you would hear, like how sorry they are or how she’s in a better place. \nOnly one sentence comforted me the most: “She isn’t in pain anymore.”\nThe one thing I wanted to do was ease the pain she was in, but this one sentence was the truth. It comforted me to know she wouldn’t struggle anymore. \nBut I wished we had another adventure together. I wished for more time. She’s gone now, and I have to accept that. \nOur emotions and experiences will never disappear, but they can turn into something different. \nGrief is difficult and never goes away, but that does not mean that I should give up. I knew my limits, and I asked for help. Now, though I feel grief, I must learn how to forge ahead.\nWe’re only humans; we feel, we love, and we fall. The grief that I feel now changes me, but it could also teach me to love harder. Her memory will live through my brothers and me forever. \nI know that I am not alone. I wasn’t the only one to lose her. She made me who I am today, and that is why she will always be with me because I am a part of her. \nShe lived the life she wanted, and now it’s my turn. Mama always said: “Keep moving forward”, and so I will. \nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nQistina Hatta, 20, is a Republic Polytechnic graduate and is currently waiting to begin her university education."

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "“Each time the phone rings, my heart will skip a beat,” I recall my mother saying when I was young.\nWhen I was about six months old, I developed an unusually large bruise on my chest. My parents took me to a community traditional Chinese medicine practitioner who advised them to immediately take me to the KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH).\nAfter several tests at the hospital, I was diagnosed with haemophilia A, an inherited bleeding disorder. \nThose living with haemophilia lack clotting factors to form blood clots, which means that without timely medical attention, it may be life-threatening.\nThis diagnosis has been life-changing, not just for me, but for my whole family.\nWorried about not having enough money to pay for medication, my father sold the family car. \nHe also changed his job from an electrical technician to a taxi driver so as to have the flexibility and a mode of transport to rush me to the hospital whenever I needed medical attention.\nTo supplement the family’s income, my homemaker mother took to distributing flyers occasionally.\nEvery three to five days, my parents would have to take me to an outpatient clinic for infusion. Each visit could take between two to four hours. \nWhen an injury happened outside of office hours, I would have to be rushed to the emergency ward where there might not be a specialist who would be able to set up the infusion procedure. \nI recalled once being admitted at 7pm and only leaving the emergency department at 6am the following day.\nMy parents were apprehensive when expecting their second child, and only decided to go ahead with the pregnancy as tests indicated a negligible chance that this child will also have the same inherited bleeding disorder.\nLiving with haemophilia meant being familiar with unexpected bleeding that can occur randomly. \nWithin an hour, the swelling around the joints can be so painful that I would no longer be able to walk.\nIn both primary and secondary school, my class was assigned a classroom on the ground floor so I did not have to navigate flights of stairs when I came to school on crutches or in a wheelchair, which was quite often.\nMy early years were sheltered. My mother did not leave me out of sight, and the flooring of the flat was padded with soft mats to cushion any fall. \nAt most, we would take short walks in the neighbourhood and return straight home.\nI was a sporty young child with lots of pent-up energy but cautious teachers did not allow me to participate in any physical or sporting activities during my primary school years. \nMy only outlet then was when my parents would take me to the neighbourhood basketball court where I would be allowed to dribble and shoot a few hoops.\nOther than physical activities, I was also not included in other school events, sometimes without due consultation. I grew up feeling discriminated against, left out and alone.\nDespite my parents’ consent, I was the only one from the class excluded from the National Day Parade (NDP) celebrations, as my primary school teachers thought there were too many steps to climb at the Marina Bay floating platform.\nI recall how I was not offered the opportunity to take part in an overseas business trip while I was in polytechnic, and I did not know the reasons for it. I gave feedback to the school authorities, but to date I still have no idea why I was excluded.\nIn spite of focusing on the limitations due to my condition, I was determined to explore how I can be a contributing member of society.\nDuring my time at a polytechnic, I would volunteer as a befriender to children who are sick or from disadvantaged families.\nFortunately, I had a second chance to volunteer for the NDP, which is my way to contribute to this quintessential event celebrating Singapore.\nPerhaps more importantly, it was able to reconcile my feelings of being discriminated against nearly a decade ago, after my school left me out of the celebrations.\nThese opportunities gave me the chance to step out of my sheltered cocoon, and I relish connecting with people from different walks of life.\nThe best years of my life were serving in the National Service. My supervisors were very supportive and gave me opportunities to take on leadership roles.\nLiving with haemophilia has inspired me to be a healthcare professional to explore better and alternative treatments so that others living with health conditions can have a better quality of life and thrive. \nI studied pharmacy science and have served nearly two years as a pharmacy technician at a restructured hospital.\nThere are two approaches to treating haemophilia. Replacement therapy is used prophylactically (taken at regular junctures) to prevent dangerous bleeds, and importantly, preserve the health and function of joints. \nTogether with appropriate training and the use of protective equipment, people living with haemophilia can lead physically active lives and participate in a number of sports even at the competitive level. \nThe more affordable alternative is to seek treatment as and when needed.\nDue to cost considerations, my parents had to take the difficult decision to decide against using prophylactic treatment. \nSo long as there is some bleeding, I will have to be sent to the hospital to receive treatment. It would require three to five treatments to truly end the bleeding. The expenses can be much higher if it is a major injury.\nDuring my NS enlistment, I had access to medical coverage which supported the costs of treatment. My doctor advised me to leverage the coverage to switch to a newer treatment which is currently not on the list of subsidised drugs. \nIn those three years, there were zero bleeding episodes, which empowered me to embrace life fully.\nBut now that I have completed my NS, I no longer have access to the comprehensive medical scheme. \nI have to give up on that treatment and revert to my former treatment regime which is on the list of subsidised drugs. Eight months later, a major bleeding episode occurred.\nI am currently using the subsidised medication. Coupled with partial charitable funding from the hospital and the Haemophilia Society of Singapore, I still have to put aside half my salary for treatment each month. \nExcessive bleeding in the joints and muscles can lead to longer-term consequences. Now, at 25, I have already developed arthritis, which is excruciatingly painful with each flare-up.\nIt is hard to imagine a future like this, but I have to make the best of my condition because this is what I was born with.\nThe reality is that people living with haemophilia can lead fulfilling and meaningful lives, and contribute like anybody else towards the community.\nWe need access to treatment for this rare disease so that it is not dependent on one’s ability to pay but based on one’s medical needs. \nThose around us can lend support by seeking to understand the disease and be inclusive. \nEducators could set an example of inclusivity. Instead of restricting students with haemophilia from regular activities, they could include less impactful sports such as swimming or frisbee and focus on involving students living with chronic health conditions.\nBy penning my thoughts here, I wish to invite the community to unleash the untapped potential of those of us living with haemophilia, by jointly envisaging and achieving a bleed-free future for all. \nThose after me do not need to live with chronic joint pain and longer-term consequences such as arthritis.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nBenjamin Tang, 25, is a pharmacy technician at a public hospital. He is diagnosed with haemophilia A, an inherited bleeding disorder in which the body lacks clotting factors to form blood clots."

            "Article Body": "Before the days of ChatGPT and Midjourney, I remember a time when the field of artificial intelligence (AI) was regarded as a buzzword for automating mundane tasks away.\nPerhaps it wasn’t seen among my peers as being on the cutting edge. In my first year at Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP) in 2020, most of the tech interest groups were mainly related to app development and cybersecurity. \nAI was not something that could compel enough students to want to start a collective of like-minded individuals. \nSimply put, there wasn’t much interest in an AI interest group. \nBut as a 19-year-old who has been devoted to the pursuit of AI and machine learning, I knew that this was a field that would blow up not just in popularity but also importance.\nThe human mind is so complex in its intricacies and it is a considerable achievement that medical science has been able to understand how it works. The next bound was for a machine to replicate what our brain does. \nThe possibilities are endless, as the public is now starting to discover with tools like ChatGPT.\nSo, encouraged by my lecturers who taught us to think innovatively and out of the box, I had a wild idea to start an AI interest group in NYP.\nI have to admit: I was somewhat worried that I did not have enough content to share with people who would join this group, or that my technical knowledge in AI was still limited.\nLittle did I expect that the greatest challenge in forming a collective of interested students wasn’t the machines, it was in trying to decipher the human connection.\nI have always been interested in technology and artificial intelligence (AI) since I was a child, thanks to my father, who holds a computer science degree.\nAnd as a family, we bonded over sci-fi movies and series such as The Matrix and Black Mirror and geeked out on technological advances in the news.\nStuff like the Smart Nation Initiative that the Government launched in 2014, which doesn’t often make for conversational material among people in my cohort, was something my dad, my older brother and I discussed voluminously about.\nOur dinner talk often revolved around how the latest tech would change our daily interactions and experiences. \nWe would discuss and debate the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on robotics, the latest advances in machine learning, and the exciting future ahead as machines begin to pick out patterns and predict our actions. \nAs I got older, my brother, who was studying for his diploma in cybersecurity and digital forensics at NYP’s School of Information Technology, continued to fuel my interest through his daily post-school recaps.\nI still dearly remember these conversations that played such a formative part in my childhood.\nBut there remained one unanswered question of how one would set about teaching a lifeless machine to make sense of the world and make autonomous decisions, possibly surpassing human intelligence.\nSo, hungering for an answer, I paid the library a visit one Thursday afternoon while waiting for my O-Level results and borrowed a book titled Machine Learning Fundamentals, which was published by Packt Publishing. \nReading it was a revelation that kickstarted my passion in the field of AI, and what also helped was being further exposed to tech through programming Lego Mindstorms and creating games using the Alice programming environment.\nBut my thirst for knowledge, as well as the influence of my father and brother made me want to pursue a career in information technology. So, I followed my brother’s path in NYP, securing an education in IT at NYP that would give me the rigorous academic experience I desired.\nAs it turns out, NYP’s IT diploma programme had indeed surpassed all expectations I had. \nI was given full rein to explore my interests and further them with opportunities like competitions, internships and extracurricular programmes. I could always feel my lecturers’ passion for the subject in their slides and lectures, and they never failed to address all the quips I had about the industry.\nIt was also with their encouragement that I decided to start an AI interest group at school for other like-minded students. \nBut the initial months were the toughest phase.\nMy first tasks: I needed to learn how to write a proposal, pitch an idea, and convince others that learning AI was a worthwhile endeavour. \nHow do I articulate this massive train of thought into a one-liner? Why would anyone be convinced to be a part of this? Where could I find members to join my executive committee? \nBeyond that, I had many concerns and doubts swirling around the top of my head.\nWhile there were online materials and how-to guides readily available, I found many of them challenging for beginners to understand. \nI wanted to create content from scratch, from the eyes of a regular polytechnic student, so my peers and seniors could relate to it.\nI was glad my family was very supportive when I shared the idea with them, with my dad and brother giving me valuable advice. \nEspecially my brother, who also had experience starting an interest group in NYP. He taught me the basics, from organisational structure to developing a proposal.\nWhat also helped was that my classmates and lecturers were by my side too, providing me with necessary feedback, even joining me for brainstorming sessions for my proposal, which I had to revise thrice before submitting it to the school.\nIn June 2020, NYP AI was launched as the first AI interest group among all polytechnics in Singapore.\nBut the challenges didn’t end there, as I had to make sure the group was productive and achieve the goals that the executive committee and I had set out.\nI still vividly recall our first event: A “beginner-friendly” project that used AI to predict housing prices. I had spent hours creating the slides and done multiple rehearsals to ensure that everyone could understand my sharing.\nI soon realised that my way of teaching could be overwhelming and confusing for some participants. \nAt some point, I thought I was not cut out to teach — I was too dull and serious of a teacher. \nHowever, as NYP AI’s committee team grew and received more participant feedback, I learnt creative ways to infuse interactivity into our events.\nGetting student interest was another hurdle we had to tackle. We relied heavily on word-of-mouth, our blog, schoolwide email blasts and our social media for publicity. \nHowever, it wasn’t enough — we were not seeing growth in numbers.\nIt was disappointing. For all the effort we’d put into creating the content, we wanted to reach out to a greater student population. Was NYP AI too niche, or were we not cut out to run an interest group?\nOur recognition increased as we adapted our teaching styles to be more approachable. Hosting events frequently definitely created visibility for us.\nFrom 30 members, we grew to 150 members in three years and continue to get larger.\nAs we adapted and found new solutions to our problems, I thought that this is exactly what I like about AI and machine learning.\nLearning from experience is at the core of AI and my whole experience came full circle. My growth as an individual charting the unknowns in human relationships mirrored that of a machine making sense of the world.\nMy greatest takeaway? It is to let go of fear, which is the core hurdle of every passion project. Do the task, because even if you fall, you will still fall forward. \nNYP AI would have remained a vision if I had not taken the leap of faith, it wouldn’t be a reality if I had surrendered to my fears and doubts.\nLooking back, this project turned out to be a humbling and meaningful experience for me. Witnessing my schoolmates’ “Aha!” moments when they finally understand an AI concept is enough to put a smile on my face. It makes the road taken worthwhile.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nAlex Chien is a 19-year-old graduate from the Diploma in Information Technology at Nanyang Polytechnic’s School of IT.

            "Article Body": "In my lower secondary days, I was a consistent top scorer with a near perfect score for all subjects.\nLife was going to be a breeze, or so I was told. Everyone around me said that having good grades was a clear marker of success and that my educational journey would be a smooth-sailing one.\nWithout thinking too much about it, I was admitted into a class for those taking nine-subject combinations in the O-Levels, believing that this was the norm for students who were top 10 percenters.\nAfter all, my younger self assumed that this was a path well-trodden by top performers. If others could do it, I could too.\nBut I was sorely mistaken.\nI quickly discovered that sciences were not my forte. I started showing signs of struggle and gradually underperformed during examinations and tests. \nI wanted to reach out to someone for help, but I never did take that step in my secondary school days, having been held back by my own ego and pride.\nFailure wasn’t an option for someone who has had everything going for her. I decided to weather the storm, so I stuck with my nine-subject combination while endangering my mental health unknowingly.\nIn hindsight, my O-Level results shouldn’t have been a surprise, but I remember having mixed feelings about my grades. \nOn one hand, my L1R4 score was a single point, but on the other hand my L1R5 score brought me into the double digits. I did poorly in my science subjects, which dragged my score down.\nAt that juncture, I should have already realised that the sciences were not for me.\nI had grandiose dreams of becoming a chemist, perfumer or even a biologist; the path pursuing science was tempting, with many areas of specialisation that appealed to me at that time. \nWhat I failed to consider, though, was my own limitations in those subjects. I made my decision based on what I thought I could be, and not on what I knew I could, or could not, do.\nThat was why I was stubbornly stuck to what I thought was the right path towards excellence, and went ahead to enter the science stream in junior college. \nAs it turns out, this was my second unwise choice in my educational journey. \nMy life in junior college became too much for me to bear, especially with the rigorous curriculum involved. The lectures were all Greek to me, making it even more challenging for me to grasp key concepts. \nWhile I made many friends there, the steep learning curve took a severe toll on my JC journey.\nAs such, I withdrew from the institution, marking the lowest point for me in my education journey. At that time, the prospect of my educational journey ending right there and then was an extremely real possibility.\nI applied for a chemistry-based course in polytechnic, again thinking that I could pull through. While I got in, I floundered again, which was not far from what I expected.\nI was so mentally exhausted by the time I was removed from that polytechnic due to my poor performance, I could no longer bring myself to pave another route for my education right away.\nWith only an O-Level certificate, I took a gap year to recuperate, hoping to pick myself up again. I am glad I did.\nI realised that all my life, I was stubbornly fixated on two things — my dream and societal expectations — that I failed to consider reality.\nDuring this time, I realised I was chasing an artificial goal of academic excellence, without much thought towards what I wanted to end up doing.\nAs such, I looked into as many industries as I could, given the limited options to choose from within the gap year. \nIn that time, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to dabble with retail marketing and videography as a support staff, and also a handful of short stints on marketing teams with some companies. \nThrough this experience, I discovered that I enjoyed creating content, and the most rewarding moment was seeing how what I created had a direct impact on the business I was supporting.\nThis time, I knew what I wanted to do in my life, and I decided to reapply into a polytechnic to pursue a diploma in mass communication.\nRepublic Polytechnic (RP) stood out for me, especially with its problem-based learning pedagogy, as I felt that it will help with my transition back to student life.\nDuring the admission interview, I had the chance to briefly share about my educational journey with my interviewers. I was lucky that instead of turning me away, they reciprocated with heartfelt advice. \nThe former school director even extended me a kind gesture and brought me to RP’s education and career coaches for a counselling session, which helped to ascertain my choice.\nThe day I received the admission offer marked the beginning of a new phase in life.\nThroughout my three polytechnic years, my thirst for knowledge and curiosity served as my constant motivation as I joined various interest groups, such as a student publication The Republican Post, and RePResent, a group that produces digital content for the school.\nI took on numerous projects with key industry partners such as Mediacorp, and participated in competitions to put my skills into practice. \nIn my final year, I also had the opportunity to intern at the Prime Minister’s Office Strategy Group, my first work experience after my one big detour in my education journey.\nBeing able to expose myself with these opportunities and graduating with a diploma in merit would not have been possible without the relentless support from my lecturers. \nToday, I am awaiting admission into a local university to further my passion in communications.\nLooking back at my education journey, I realised there is more to learn about myself through adversity, and despite the difficult journey I went through, I never gave up on myself. \nI now understand where I stand and how determined I am to get there.\nIt hasn’t been easy, but I believe that it is okay to make wrong choices and learn valuable lessons later. The bitter taste of failure helped to shape the person I am today and gave me a greater awareness of my own strengths and weaknesses as I progress through life.\nYes, I may be several years behind some of my peers, and my path might have turned out to be more convoluted than others.\nHowever, I know now that there really is no such thing as a fixed route in life, with one exception: that ignoring reality and having tunnel vision is a sure path to disappointment and regret.\nInstead, what matters more is reaching the finishing line.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nVeronica Lee Wan Ling, 23, is a polytechnic graduate waiting to enter university."

            "Article Body": "I would never have guessed two years ago that I would one day be the founder of a travel company that does social adventures, in spite of a pandemic that had decimated global travel.\nLike many of my Generation Z peers, Covid-19 has turned my university experience upside down.\nI was a second-year undergraduate at Nanyang Technological University when the world went into lockdown, with what was once supposed to be the highlight of my youth turning into a socially isolating one.\nInstead of being a part of a raucous community of university students who could hang out after lessons, online classes and Zoom hangouts became the new norm. \nIt was also a challenging time for my mental health. Without any physical connection to my friends, I was spending a good part of my time alone. \nThe pandemic made me realise how much I had taken simple things like group dinners and school-wide activities for granted.\nBut as borders reopened, I was fortunate enough to be one of the first students to go for a semester abroad for an undergraduate study programme at Denmark Technical University.\nSo, I spent half a year in Copenhagen and my time overseas was transformative. I found myself immersed in a vibrant student community, where I got to learn with peers from all around the world. \nDuring my exchange, I travelled extensively and went on a ski trip to the French alps with 50 other students from Singapore. \nIt was incredibly easy to connect with them as we had a lot in common. \nIn particular, there were a few of us who were in the field of software engineering, and we quickly bonded over our interests. These connections lasted beyond the trip as we still meet up to work and eat together every now and then, more than a year later. \nThe experience was a revelation: I experienced firsthand how an adventure could turn strangers into friends, and how it could expand our horizons in unimaginable ways.\nThe semester abroad was undoubtedly a highlight of my university life, as I experienced personal growth, developed meaningful friendships, and discovered the joy of being part of a like-minded community.\nAs I returned home to complete my last semester at university, I realised that upon becoming a working adult, I could lose such social experiences with large groups of like-minded peers. \nSchool would be the final opportunity for that, and my window of opportunity was shorter than most thanks to Covid-19, I thought to myself.\nOf course, one might argue that working life can be social too, but I believe it won’t be able to provide the experiences that school life offered me.\nThe transition from schooling to the working world often comes with a shift in priorities and a lack of structured social experiences. \nOnce we leave the familiar environment of school, there are no more classes or school clubs that give us the platform to meet and connect with other peers. \nI’ve read much about how it can be difficult for working adults to maintain existing connections, much less find the opportunity to make new friends.\nWhen I entered the corporate world as a software engineer, I experienced another sense of deja vu from those pandemic years as my company was working remotely.\nI wanted to meet new people and expand my network, but there were few meaningful ways to do so. \nEach day, I would wake up, log on to my computer, and go about my work day without a single face-to-face interaction. Most events and gatherings are short-lived, and the connections made there are often superficial and fleeting. \nMy working days were pretty mundane and time seemed to slip away without anything memorable happening. I was reluctant to accept the reality that this would be my life for the next 50 years.\nSo, I turned to TikTok and started posting videos asking people to ski in the French Alps with me. I made sure to use a catchy title and that was the birth of The Great Singapore Ski Trip.\nSoon after, sign-ups were pouring into the Google Form, which I used to gather interest in my ad hoc vacation idea. \nThis overwhelming response from fellow Gen Zs and millennials in Singapore confirmed my suspicion: there was a strong appetite for social adventures. \nI realised that I was not the only one who had been feeling this way when we transition from being a student into our working lives. \nMany fellow Gen Zs and millennials want to expand their social network in an authentic and fun way. And what better way to meet new friends through travel, a pastime many young Singaporeans already love.\nThus, the idea for Sotravel, a community-focused travel platform, was born.\nNevertheless, starting the company came with its fair share of challenges. To obtain a travel agent licence from the Singapore Tourism Board, I needed S$100,000 of paid-up capital.\nThis was a daunting sum of money for a fresh graduate like myself. I pooled my savings and there was still a significant shortfall. \nFor a time, I contemplated giving up and shelving the idea. But I pressed on in the end, knowing that I would be letting down the community if I were to do that. \nKnowing that there was great financial risk, I decided to borrow the remaining capital from friends and family who believed in the idea.\nIt was an incredibly daunting process to ask people around me for money, but it would be a huge regret if I did not try. \nI am grateful and privileged to have such supportive family and friends, and knowing that they had backed me up when I needed to kickstart my business idea drives me to work even harder to build something they would be proud of.\nI also roped in two of my friends to become partners when I realised that this entrepreneurship journey would not be possible alone. \nThe three of us were already friends thanks to a couchsurfing trip during our exchange, and despite our different backgrounds, we shared the same belief that our idea could work.\nAs Sotravel began to gain traction among travellers, we faced logistical obstacles as organising large group trips is a complex task.\nBut with every challenge we overcame, our determination to make Sotravel a success grew stronger.\nOver time, we have become deliberate in how we designed our trips. \nWe only host trips that are activity-based, because we understood that most Gen Zs and millennials do not want to sit on a tour bus shuttling them around monuments.\nWe concentrated on creating travel experiences that were more fun with larger groups, such as skiing, outdoor climbing and trekking.\nMore importantly, our itineraries were designed to break the ice, foster friendships, and create unforgettable memories. \nBecause everyone on the trip would already have a common interest in the activity they are doing, that common ground helps build a sense of community.\nIn the coming month, Sotravel would have brought over 130 travellers to ski, surf and climb all around the world. I never expected a simple TikTok video to evolve into a platform like this.\nLooking back, I'm reminded of the importance of connection, the power of shared experiences, and the magic of travel.\nIn a world where genuine connections can be hard to come by, I am grateful to be building a community that offers an opportunity for people to rediscover the joy of togetherness.\nAs American novelist Anais Nin wrote: \"We travel, some of us forever, to seek other places, other lives, other souls.\"\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nLarry Lee, 25, is the founder of Sotravel, a social adventure travel company"

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "It’s been close to three and a half years since I dove into a career path within the death care industry.\nFor as long as I could remember, my childhood was filled with hearing conversations about funerals and death.\nAs a child, I never really understood why people were always so curious about this industry or why they thought it was special or interesting.\nI would wonder why parents would shield their children’s eyes from a void deck wake, or take a long detour to avoid passing by a funeral.\nMy parents, who run the funeral company Casket Fairprice as the family business, would do the opposite.\nThey would deliberately slow down their footsteps when passing by a wake, just to take a peek at what others were doing, with me tagging along behind.\nThey called it “market research” and it was a common occurrence for a younger me.\nIn my mind, the idea of embalming the deceased and laying a person to rest did not feel out of the ordinary. I didn’t even realise that not many my age felt the same way.\nAs a kid, I would stand there observing bereaved families grieve over their loved ones. The concept of death, loss, grief and mortality was something that I registered early on in life.\nIt was this awareness at a very young age that made me seek something different and meaningful in life, but I was only able to fully understand death and mortality and how it relates to life after I began a career in the funeral industry.\nPrior to starting my unconventional career, I also had an unconventional education path as a school dropout.\nTwo weeks after starting school at my dream secondary school, I dropped out of the formal education system in favour of homeschooling.\nWhy? I craved the freedom of choice from a young age. \nI wasn't naturally gifted in the areas of mathematics and science, but I had an interest in the study of economics and business, which were post-secondary courses.\nYes, I recognise that it is important to get a grasp of fundamentals, but a younger me was laser-focused on what I knew I wanted to pursue in life.\nThus, I embarked on a homeschooling journey, where I had the freedom to decide what I wanted to do with my time. \nNeedless to say, my decision to quit school was met with the dismay of many friends and relatives, who were afraid that I would fall behind in the rat race and turn out to be a failure.\nI somehow managed to do well enough to enter university a month after I celebrated my 15th birthday, pursuing a Bachelor in Business Administration at Singapore Institute of Management (SIM)-University at Buffalo.\nAt the same time, I had the opportunity to work part-time as a customer service officer in a hair salon along Somerset.\nOne of my favourite things about the job was the sense of satisfaction I got through serving customers and seeing them leave the salon with a smile. It was through this job that I knew that I wanted to work in a customer-oriented industry, in a place where providing customers with contentment and peace of mind comes first.\nAround that time, I was helping in the redesign and content creation for Casket Fairprice’s website. I remember spending hours just researching and reading up on the ins and outs of the funeral industry.\nOnly through that did I come to realise that funerals are also for the living — it is a profession where good customer service plays a crucial role.\nAt a time when bereaved families need the most support, the funeral operations team makes the biggest difference in making them feel taken care of, composed and at peace with the choices that they made.\nI was also touched by the reviews left by customers who expressed gratitude to the funeral operations team. I could really feel their sincerity and appreciation for the team who were there for them when they needed it the most.\nI suppose this is where the seed was first sown. \nFor as long as I can remember, I've been searching for significance and direction in my work. Joining the funeral industry thus offered the opportunity to bring relief to the lives of grieving families and their loved ones. What could be more fulfilling than that?\nI wanted to know more, discover more and do more for those who are on this journey and for those that are supporting them. I was passionate about wanting to serve this community.\nSome might say it’s a calling, but for me it just felt right. It felt like a natural path to go back to my roots and to embark on a career that I had passion for.\nWhen I first started out, I was mostly learning and understanding about the operations behind every funeral arrangement. \nBut the journey has not been an easy one.\nAs part of my first few years in the business, I’ve helped to transfer bodies at the hospital, take activation calls in the wee hours of the night and even acquired an embalming certificate.\nToday, I’ve undertaken a more backend role, where I develop, grow and bring the company and my team to greater heights.\nAs a funeral service provider, I know that while it is important for us to organise a dignified funeral service for departed loved ones, it is also our job to soothe the minds of the living.\nThe thing about seeing death and grief so much is that it makes you self-reflect and puts things into perspective. \nAt the end of the day, life is short and most things are not a big deal. I’ve learnt to take things in my stride and go with the flow.\nWhy sour relations over something trivial? Why let egos get in the way? Outside of work, I’ve become more “cincai” (Hokkien slang for doing as one pleases), and stopped being so uptight about things.\nSince starting work in this industry and hearing several stories of our departed clients, I’ve come to realise that one of my biggest fears is that at the end of my life, I will come to regret not prioritising the things that matter.\nHaving regrets is a huge burden to carry, and one example is that we often fail to appreciate the people we have around us until it’s too late. \nI see this play out frequently in funerals, with loved ones expressing their regrets of not spending enough time with the deceased, making amends for a past wrong, or saying the words that were left unsaid. \nIt's sad to hear these stories, but it serves as a very important reality check.\nBeing surrounded by death has made me more aware about the fragility of life. But there’s a difference between constantly living in the fear of death and accepting your mortality — one is crippling while the other is liberating.\nFor me, it’s the latter. I feel that if we become more in touch with our mortality, we cease being lured away by life’s distractions and focus on what really matters.\nWe get caught up in the many “side quests” of life that we fail to prioritise the people, dreams and goals that matter.\nAnd for me, what’s most important right now are the happiness and wellbeing of my loved ones, discovering new experiences and being able to serve the community.\nSince then, I’ve been able to grow, learn, and develop through the path I took. Looking back, there are many wonderful lessons I’ve learnt over the years that I wouldn’t trade for anything else.\n \nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nRachael Tay, 23, is a corporate development manager at Casket Fairprice."

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "Last December, I had a whole speech planned out to address my cohort of attendees during the “graduation ceremony” of a leadership camp to reflect on the past four days and three nights that we spent together.\nMy team, Watch Four, picked me to represent them as their speaker, and we had spent the previous day consolidating our thoughts and bouncing ideas off each other on what to say. \nQuite quickly, we came up with a few main takeaways from the inaugural Our Singapore Leadership Programme (OSLP), a four-day camp organised by the National Youth Council and National Community Leadership Institute (NACLI), in partnership with the Ministry of Education.\nAs part of the final day of the camp, I recall how changemakers were invited to speak to us and impart words of wisdom about leadership. \nOne mentioned that we should “surround ourselves with like-minded people”. \nAt first, I took it down in a note on my phone, as a few heads in the audience bobbled up and down in agreement. \nYet, something felt wrong, and I held on to the backspace button on my phone. \nWith less than 10 minutes to go until I was due to speak, I went on stage and said: “Surround yourself with 'unlike-minded' people. Find that common ground.” \nWhy? The camp taught me that in order to challenge my beliefs, I had to be with people who held different views, which would either serve to solidify my convictions or break down perceptions I once held true. \nBefore attending this programme, I had grown up in an all-girls school for 10 years of my life. From an early stage in my life, I thought I had my morals and beliefs figured out. \nBut this residential camp, a leadership programme open to representatives from different secondary schools, succeeded in challenging my preconceived notions.\nWith me were 53 Secondary 4 student leaders who came from MOE schools as well as madrasahs, as part of the camp’s inaugural run from Dec 5 to 8, 2022. Like me, every student leader present had been nominated by our respective schools to attend this programme.\nStepping into the NACLI Multi-Purpose Hall, where the camp was held, I could not recognise a single familiar face. It was like reliving my first day of school all over again. \nYet that was precisely what set this camp apart. With everyone having different backgrounds, each person brought uniquely contrasting views to the table. Everyone’s personality was a mosaic of their past struggles, present obstacles, and future victories. \nDuring the workshops organised, we tackled issues in depths unachievable elsewhere. We were encouraged to take our rose-tinted glasses off and fruitful conversations found fertile ground. \nTopics like our Singapore identity, the environment, and innovation were discussed as we spoke about how future generations can build a shared future. \nWhile some simple questions confounded me, camp facilitators were thankfully there to shepherd us every step of the way, encouraging us to stretch our limits and confront preconceived notions. \nA prime example of how we bonded was the night we spent sleeping over in the National Museum Singapore, where we traced our Singaporean roots and awed at the work of our forefathers. \nDespite our different backgrounds, I knew that we were in this together. With each passing day, my group members broke barriers and grew together as a team. \nOur differences never once sparked animosity, instead, they opened up doors for us to get a taste of the world outside our own.\nAbove all, the meaning of leadership often popped up during our group discussions.\nTo me, the idea of leadership has been frighteningly distorted in our modern society. Instead of a charismatic idol with millions of followers, I see a leader as a shepherd leading his or her sheep.\nLeading, as I’ve come to learn in my admittedly limited years of personal experience and observation, is not about holding the loudhailer on the stage. \nJust like how shepherds walk alongside their sheep and guide them with their shepherd’s staff, leaders don’t merely stand in the front to command attention.\nThe best leaders leave footprints by walking the talk. They lead from within the community and within their hearts. \nDuring the camp, we had multiple chances to converse with Green Advocates – people who started social enterprises and organisations since their youth. \nI quickly noticed a pattern: Their ambitions were not limited by age. \nSome of them made a mid-career decision, others sowed their seed in entrepreneurship while still schooling, and despite their youth, these changemakers have already left such deep footprints in the sand. \nIt made me realise that age is not a limitation. So long as we all have visions of a better future, we should not let age stop us from charging ahead and making those dreams a reality.\nLooking back at my camp experience, it provided new and insightful experiences, as well as deep conversations and inspiring awakenings.\nAs we parted ways, my team reminisced with a bittersweet note, as though we were long-time buddies.\nIf there was one takeaway I got, it would be to surround yourself with people that will spark growth in ourselves, and to take that leap and see our aspirations materialise.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nJemmima Tan Shin En, 16, is a first-year junior college student at Eunoia JC.

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "We were tasked to \"fall in\" outside the Maju Camp cookhouse at 6.30am. But with just two minutes shy of our deadline, I knew my section of women and I would not make it in time.\nI had already folded my bedsheets, packed my helmet in a bag, and filled up my water bottle. Yet, my section mates were still getting ready.\nI’ve heard nightmarish stories from my male counterparts about being punished for lacking punctuality during their basic military training phase in their National Service (NS) days.\nAs one friend told me, the whole section would be sent upstairs to the dormitory, then ordered to report in again, along with a not-inconsequential number of push-ups as a punishment for being late.\nSo when we finally left our room at 6.32am, I had a sense of impending doom. But in the name of camaraderie, I figured I might as well be late too and suffer the penalty that would surely come.\nBut when our commanders told us not rush in case we trip and fall, then ushered us to the cookhouse for our breakfast, I was greatly surprised that we were let off the hook.\nI was one of 31 participants at this year’s Women’s Boot Camp — a two-day experience at Maju Camp in Clementi which gives women a chance to taste of NS life, albeit a toned-down version.\nOrganised by the Advisory Council on Community Relations in Defence (Accord) and supported by the Singapore Armed Forces Volunteer Corps, this year’s camp was targeted at youth.\nMost participants were aged 18 to 20, having voluntarily signed up through their respective junior colleges and polytechnics.\nAll had various reasons to be there, such as wanting a taster of the NS experience because they were interested to join the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Volunteer Corps, or just to understand what their male counterparts go through in their late teens.\nMe? I had been asked by my editors to take part in it, and I was quite intrigued by the idea. After all, who wouldn’t pounce on the opportunity to shoot a rifle?\nThe caveat was that I had to spend a night in Maju Camp, which was quite an intimidating trade-off.\nIt's no open secret that the physical training during NS can be gruelling, which troubled me as I’m also extremely unathletic.\nThat fact sunk in when I realised that during the standard obstacle course, the ledge that we had to scale over, which was cruelly called the \"low wall\", was beyond my reach.\nAs we did not have the army boots a typical recruit would be required to wear, we could only do nine of the obstacles.\nAdmittedly, I failed on my first try of some obstacles. I somehow ended up facing backwards and towards my instructor when I scaled the ledge for the first time. I also utterly failed at trying to climb up the low rope.\nBut another part of me did experience the thrill of being able to go through the obstacles, learning how each station serves to train NS men and regulars for different wartime scenarios.\nIn another training exercise, we were taught by SAF instructors how to apply tourniquets and how to evacuate a casualty safely through combat buddy aid. I gleefully brought that skill home with me, showing off my newfound skills to my exasperated mother by dragging her around our home after the camp.\nMy favourite part of the camp, of course, was handling the SAR21 rifle, the reason why I signed up for this camp.\nFor one, I never expected weapons to be this heavy, having seen people wield them with ease at the National Day Parade.\nThe weight of the gun with its strap around my neck weighed me down, and I wondered how people could go through the obstacle course carrying this weight, or having to endure long route marches with the rifles and field packs that can weigh as much as 20kg each.\nDespite this, the most memorable part of the boot camp was the enthusiasm of the other participants, who had endless questions for the women of the Singapore Armed Forces Volunteer Corps as well as the SAF trainers.\n“What happens during your period when you are out on the field,” asked one participant. “What are some things women can’t do in the army,” asked another.\nI was expecting a corporate rah-rah response about how women in NS went through it exactly like other men do, or some motivational line about how women can do it too.\nBut their answers were refreshingly truthful, that women do experience things differently than men in the army because of practical differences.\nFor example, one of the obstacles in the standard obstacle course cannot be performed by females because it involves putting pressure on their uterus. During outfield trainings, I was also surprised to hear that women might need to keep their used sanitary pads before disposing of them after the exercise is over.\nIn preparation for the boot camp, I spoke to some friends about what NS life is like.\nOne told me about the time he choked while squeezing the contents of a ration pack directly in his mouth.\nAnother recalled how he could barely think after a gruelling route march. When asked to recite the SAF's eight core values during their \"water parade\", he gave an incorrect answer and ended up having to do push-ups.\nTruth be told, what I went through during the weekend was a sanitised version of NS.\nI had a spoon to eat my rations and didn't need to wolf down a meal by squeezing food out of a bag. I also somehow could get away with my bad jokes with my commanders during the water parade, such as when they asked us to drink \"beyond the point of thirst\".\nIn fact, I was expecting a lot more colourful language to be used in my two-day NS experience. I think I was the only person spewing vulgarities at the camp.\nNevertheless, I read some comments from netizens who thought that participants of the Women's Boot Camp got it too easy, describing the camp as an “offence to NS” that would incite women to “think NS is so easy”.\nThis, I find, is unwarranted.\nThe participants had joined the camp as volunteers to actively try to experience what many male Singaporeans go through, and their willingness and enthusiasm deserve applause, not dismissal.\nAs camp organiser Joanna Portilla said, it is easy to take peace time for granted. It is also just as easy to stay ignorant about what NS men and regulars do on a daily basis to keep our country safe.\nGoing through the boot camp made me truly understand that NS isn't easy. And the trainers and volunteers were there constantly reminding us of how much more regulars would have to do on a daily basis.\nI finally understood why my male friends would constantly go on about their NS experiences, because the two years they spent serving the country was a common ground to bond with others.\nDespite the bootcamp being only two days long, I can somewhat understand the lingo and inside jokes, although I still get confused by the numerous acronyms used.\nI learnt new figurative language about how I can’t run as fast as my trainer’s grandparents, for example.\nBeyond gaining a better appreciation of the men and women protecting our nation, I left the camp with a body ache and an army assault bag, a memento of my time there.\nI hope more women would get the opportunity to attend a camp like this. And if the Singapore Police Force or Singapore Civil Defence Force organises something similar, I hope I’ll get to attend it.\n \nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nLoraine Lee is a journalist with TODAY."

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "Back in 2015, my worst fears as a 12-year-old kid were realised when I didn’t do as well as I wanted to for my Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE).\nI thought about this recently when I watched a viral TikTok clip of a mum influencer who posted about her daughter in tears upon receiving her O-Level results. \nWhile most netizens’ attention was on the mother’s decision to share such a private moment in public, my thoughts were on the reactions of her daughter.\nI recall being in her shoes nine years ago. Staring at the number on my results slip, I burst out crying in the school hall because I scored 20 points lower than I had hoped.\nBut PSLE was over, and there was nothing I could do to change my grades.\nThe only thing I could do was to spend the next week carefully considering what school to go to. Every school I had hoped to attend was now out of my score range, so my parents and I had to hastily assemble a list of schools that I could qualify for in my area.\nIt was then that I remember hearing the phrase “every school is a good school” for the first time.\nIt sounded like a consolation for my poorer-than-expected results — my parents said it as they discussed the pros and cons of each school almost as if they were trying to justify my school choice to themselves.\nBut my disappointment was immeasurable.\nFor a time, when people asked me which school I picked, I’d say it was one of the crappy neighbourhood schools in the Bedok area, without identifying which school it was.\nAt the time, my understanding of the term good schools consisted of those elite schools that boasted of rich culture and produced swells of top scorers. The kind of school that you’d proudly bring up when people asked you what school you came from.\nThe recent discussions about the relocations of Anglo-Chinese School (Junior) and Anglo-Chinese School (Primary) underscored how different the public views them. Such brand names have the ability to raise property values in a neighbourhood just by relocating there.\nNo one would bat an eyelid if my “neighbourhood” school moved to a new space.\nToday, three years after I left my secondary school, I can proudly look back at my time there with fondness and gratitude. \nBut I didn’t always feel this way.\nBack then, I recall feeling envious whenever I learnt about the opportunities that students from other schools had.\nI would often hear about the Victoria School experience of one of my close friends from primary school who had scored well for his PSLE.\nHe’d recount all the interesting things that the Victorian experience could give him, such as a month-long boarding programme for students to live on campus.\nI would also hear other friends regale with stories about how they tried their hand in co-curricular activities (CCA) like shooting and sailing, which weren’t available in my school.\nI recall feeling jealous that I wasn’t presented with the same opportunities they were. Would I have joined sailing as a CCA? Probably not, but it would’ve been nice to have it presented as an option, rather than not having it at all.\nHow would you discover that you’ve got a knack for archery if you never got to try it?\nBut over time, I realised my school did prepare me for life in the way that I needed, which was to grow at my own pace.\nI wasn’t burdened by unhealthy expectations to excel, in the way that I might have felt if I was in a school where academic excellence is the norm.\nInstead, I experienced a freedom to focus on developing other aspects of my life. I had the time to cultivate my personal interests and explore different topics that weren’t covered in my everyday schooling syllabus, expanding my horizons beyond what I was traditionally exposed to.\nOver the next few years, I devoted as much free time as possible to cultivating my love of writing. Be it essay writing for school or my own creative stories, I wrote extensively in an A5-sized notebook that I carried with me everywhere.\nThough they weren’t the most well-written pieces, I enjoyed expressing myself through writing and this extensive effort ultimately improved my writing skills.\nWriting seemed to be the one thing I enjoyed that I was also half decent at.\nAny other free time that I could squirrel away was spent exploring other hobbies and interests, like learning the guitar and keeping up-to-date about international news and current affairs.\nDespite this, I was never able to shake away this feeling of mediocrity, not because I wasn’t confident about who I was and what I could do, but because of outsiders who have a preconceived notion about what a neighbourhood school kid represents.\nThere is a stereotype of students like us as rowdy, lazy or just simply not as intelligent as the folks from elite schools.\nBut this was not my experience at all. The people I met in secondary school did not fit neatly into these stereotypes and were a diverse bunch of folks from all walks of life.\nThey might not have the best academic grades, but it is not because of the lack of trying.\nI fondly remember setting up “camp” at the study tables in Our Tampines Hub for six- to eight-hour long study sessions with my friends in the months leading up to our O-Levels, with some teachers even dropping by on weekends to offer us extra help.\nIn these sessions, I hear of my fellow students scheduling late night tuition classes that could stretch until 11pm so that they could brush up on their weaker subjects.\nAnd yes, while my classmates sometimes did things that defied logic, you never know if it could result in an innovative way to accomplish things.\nWork smart, not hard, was what we’d say.\nThat urge to defy society’s stereotypes of neighbourhood school students spurred me to work harder in Secondary 4 to prove others wrong.\nI pushed myself to work harder than ever for my O-Levels to ensure that my grades could qualify for admission into my desired polytechnic course.\nAnd in polytechnic, I was given many opportunities to explore my interests, ultimately leading to an internship at TODAY.\nWhile I still have a long journey ahead of me, it felt like I had come full circle after seeing my secondary school teachers sharing the articles that I wrote, proudly proclaiming that it was their ex-student that wrote it.\nI know the moment when you receive bad grades, it feels like the end of the world. For some reason, pupils become convinced that upcoming national exams are the end or be all of your life, and that it is a crucial turning point in your life that you cannot mess up.\nBut hey, despite messing up pretty badly for my own PSLE, things still worked out for me.\nI won’t lie, sometimes scoring better makes life easier because you’re presented with more opportunities that will bring you closer to your goals, but there’s no harm in taking a different route to get to where you want to be.\nIt really doesn’t matter which school we end up in. What neighbourhood schools may lack in resources and opportunities, the experience makes up for it by giving us resilience and an underdog spirit.\nAs Hannah Montana, the icon of my Generation Z in my opinion, put it in her song from the 2009 Hannah Montana movie: “There's always gonna be another mountain, I'm always gonna wanna make it move.\n“Always gonna be an uphill battle, sometimes you're gonna have to lose. Ain't about how fast I get there, ain't about what's waiting on the other side. It's the climb.”\nThere is more to life than grades, take a step back, enjoy your youth and just live in the moment.\nTrust the process, because at the end of that day, you’ll remember the journey more fondly than the destination.\n \nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nLou Si Yuan, 19, is a third-year creative writing student at Singapore Polytechnic. She was previously an intern journalist at TODAY."

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "After my N-Level examinations, I was uncertain whether I could find a job.\nI had pursued a course in nutrition and food science and always dreamed of joining the food and beverage industry upon my graduation.\nBut for a long time, I had many questions about my future and what I could do when I entered the working world.\nWill any organisation hire someone on the autism spectrum like myself? \nDoes my handicap exclude me from the workforce? Is there a place in this world for someone like me? \nWhen I was around 18 to 19 years old, I attended some training courses to prepare myself for the F&B industry, but was not able to find suitable job placements.\nMy mum, who is always very supportive of me and my aspirations, helped to look around for suitable training courses that I could learn from and increase my chances of employability.\nIt was a blessing that my mum got to know about the YMCA-Inclus Train and Place Series, a new vocational programme launched this year funded by the Citi Foundation.\nTaking place over several weeks, the programme equips youth with special needs, like myself, with vocational skills related to the F&B and hospitality industries.\nAdditionally, we are provided with enrichment activities aimed at improving our physical, mental and emotional well-being.\nUpon completion, the programme supports us through guided interviews and access to a network of partners, to enhance our opportunities for long-term employment.\nI recall my mum telling me about this programme at a time when I felt lost and uncertain, with a tendency to refuse new experiences.\nBut her belief in me and her conviction that this programme was a real opportunity made me really interested and I wanted to give it a shot.\nYet, not everything went as smoothly as I hoped it would.\nIt is a fact that most people with autism have problems with motor skills, which can range from bad handwriting to difficulties with walking.\nIn the initial stages of the programme, I struggled with activities that focused on fine motor skills, problem solving, stress management and teamwork.\nMore often than not, I got frustrated that I was not able to complete the tasks given.\nAnother challenge I faced was learning new things and picking up new skills in general. I usually get very anxious when faced with a new task before me.\nInstead of calling it quits, I decided to persevere and try my best to overcome these challenging moments during the programme. The daily encouragement of my parents kept me going.\nI am also grateful that the trainers at YMCA are really nice and patient to me, helping me ease into the programme. \nOver time, my confidence grew with their support.\nThroughout the course of the programme, I also got to pick up new skills in the F&B industry, such as attending to customers, food hygiene and cutlery cleaning.\nAnother exciting part of the programme is that I got to participate in arts and sports enrichment sessions to improve my well-being.\nI participated in dance sessions every Friday, where I really enjoyed the high energy music. I never knew that dancing could be so much fun!\nAfter many weeks of learning and fun moments, I was so elated when graduation day finally came. I was part of the first batch of youth who graduated from the programme on April 14 last year.\nWith support from the trainers and my family, I was able to find stable employment in an F&B-related job at a local hotel. \nDuring the programme, I went through role-playing sessions and job interviews to prepare me to enter the working world. \nThe interviews were guided, which meant that staff members from Inclus sat in during my arranged job interviews with potential employers. Inclus is a social enterprise that empowers persons with special needs through gainful employment and independence.\nThey guided me on how to better express myself and also explained what the contract terms meant so that I could better understand the job I was applying for. \nWithout them, it would be an uphill task as I do not think I can easily pass a job interview on my own.\nAt my new job, my main tasks include polishing cutlery, setting up and cleaning the seating area. I really enjoy my work!\nI met managers and colleagues who are really patient with me, as I settle into my new routines and tasks.\nAside from putting the hard skills I learnt into work, I also learnt how to better communicate with my colleagues.\nWhen I need some advice on how to perform better at work, I am thankful that I can still approach my job coach from Inclus.\nOver the past few months of working, I learnt that F&B services in general can be very dynamic, and there are a lot of changes to adapt to.\nOne thing I am still working on is to be more flexible and be able to adapt to changes in my work schedule, as well as being more attentive and careful.\nLooking back, I think what made a difference was the fact that there are many opportunities for persons with special needs to learn and grow.\nIn the past, I would usually say no to new things.\nBut now, I will at least try, and I encourage others to do the same. There is a place for people with special needs in our society, it just takes some work to get there.\nI can see that my parents were happy for me when I secured a job, and I am so blessed and thankful for their love and support for me for the past 19 years.\nNow, I want to become more independent, so that I can take better care of myself and give my parents more assurance for my future.\n \nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nClarissa Ng, 19, works in the F&B industry, after graduating from the YMCA-Inclus Train and Place Series, a vocational programme launched in 2022 to train youth with special needs."

            "Article Body": "For six years, I found myself straddling various responsibilities.\nAs a teenager then, I worked full-time as a customer service officer in the aviation sector while pursuing my bachelor’s degree in marketing and international business at Murdoch University.  \nDuring my final year of my three-year-long bachelor's degree, my grandfather fell seriously ill. He was over 80 years old and very weak and needed all the help he could get.\nBetween my siblings and me, we rotated nightly shifts to look after him so as to ensure he received all the care he needed.\nThis happened on each night that my dad was working overseas while my mom had to take care of all aspects of our own household, on top of her own health.\nI remember burning the midnight oil to work on my school assignments while caring for my grandpa at home.\nThose days felt long. I felt worn out at the end of an eight to 12-hour workday, while doing my best to juggle deadlines of my assignments and exams, which were stressful at most times.\nAs a teenager who also has social needs, I struggled to give up plans with friends to look after my family or prioritise assignments over family time.\nI recall feeling very overwhelmed, stressed and fatigued at that time.\nI struggled for a while with the burden of all this responsibility placed on me. I often fell asleep during lessons, could not concentrate properly at work and had frequent migraines too. \nThere were days I felt like giving up on my academics. So what if I didn’t do well in school?\nBut I never did throw in the towel. What kept me going was my goal of working in a global company, and that my education, work experience and determination would eventually help me get there.\nThis was an aspiration that I had since I was little — that there was a bigger world for me to participate in. \nBeing part of a multinational corporation also showed me that there are equal opportunities for every individual to make an impact, regardless of their background. \nI also aspired to be in a position where I could learn about different perspectives from around the world thanks to my diverse teams of colleagues.\nUpon my graduation, I was still undecided about the field that I wanted to pursue, but I knew I wanted two things: To gain hands-on experience, and to do something that has a positive impact on society. \nOne day, I came across a commercial for Skills Ignition SG — an upskilling programme by Infocomm Media Development Authority and Google. \nThe ad showed a delivery worker, who had little to no digital-related work experience, benefitting from a programme that is meant to give Singaporeans a head start in such jobs.\nThe idea of becoming a trainee at a major tech company excited me, but with a GCE Normal (Academic) background, I didn't think I stood a chance as it seemed that only top students or those who went to a top university would be considered.\nI hesitated in applying as I didn't think I would qualify and didn't meet all of the prerequisites. But my fiance insisted that I should try even if I didn't get in. \nAfter all, my family situation had already eased up by then. I had more time on my hands to commit to my goal of landing a job in the tech industry by focusing on picking up new skills. \nSo, I decided to reach out to the trainee featured in the ad on LinkedIn to learn about her story. Thanks to her positive feedback and my fiance's support, I applied for the programme.\nWithin a few weeks, I received an email stating that I was shortlisted for an interview. I just remembered screaming in excitement, \"My application went through!\" Each time I passed an interview round, it felt like a huge relief. \nWhen I finally received the email from Google saying I was accepted, it was the most incredible feeling. I was jumping with joy and could not wait to get started on this new path.\nDuring the three months of vocational training, I learned about the different digital marketing frameworks and how to create marketing proposals. \nDeveloping websites, and products and marketing them to specific markets were additional skills I picked up during the training. In addition to marketing and communication, entrepreneurial activity had a great deal of impact, as my long-term goal was to start my own business one day.\nWhen I started my six months of on-the-job training at Google, it felt like I was about to start a new chapter of my life. \nI was so nervous and couldn't find the courage to make conversations and connect with other people. \nBut the open environment encouraged me to meet new people over coffee chats, learn more about their team culture, and get acquainted with my new role.\nThis was a far cry from my six years juggling various responsibilities, when I had to sacrifice my social time due to another competing need.   \nLooking back, I am grateful to myself and my family for riding through that challenging period together, and that ordeal only inspired me further to pursue my dreams of working in a global company. \nFive months into the internship programme, I saw an available opening within the tech customer experience team at Google. \nI took it, and even though I thought I lacked the technical skills for the job, my prior customer service experience and ongoing traineeship journey helped to secure that spot.\nIt's been two months into my new role now. \nI'm learning something new and exciting every day and having the chance to express my thoughts without fear of rejection or judgement made me feel good about myself. \nI started to embrace change and improve for the better. And this was all because of that perseverance, and that leap of faith to step outside my comfort zone and do things that are uncomfortable but necessary for my own well-being.\nFive years on, I am no longer the stressed and easily overwhelmed person that I was in my teens. \nWith so much placed on my shoulders then, I realised I lacked the breathing room to discover myself and my own abilities. \nThe job experience and shadowing sessions helped me perform better in creativity, communication, and teamwork in my full-time role.\nMost importantly, I discovered the importance of believing in myself, and there is a bright future awaiting those who dare to break out of their mould.\n \nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nJasmina Banu, 24, is a platforms solutions consultant at Google Singapore."

            "Article Body": "I am one of the many young adults who started tertiary education in 2020 during the pandemic — a Covid-19 student, in other words.\nAs a result, most of my first two years studying information technology at Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP) was a solitary experience. \nProjects and presentations were all done virtually, while we attended lessons from the comfort and safety of home.\nIt was only in my final year, after my internship began, did I discover what I was missing from my polytechnic experience.\nFor most, tertiary education is the bridge between childhood and adulthood, learning what it takes to become a financially independent individual entering the working world for the first time.\nBut with everyone studying or working in silos from home due to the pandemic and lacking the rich physical interactions that a polytechnic environment can bring, I did not realise that I gave little thought to what life could have in store for me in the working world.\nThat was until I joined a year-long internship with OCBC Bank in 2022, which is considered to be quite a lengthy programme.\nKnown as Ignite, it is a new scheme meant for third-year polytechnic students in the information technology field.\nThe selling point for this internship is that it is specially tailored to every student’s interest, be it data analytics or mobile app development.\nHaving honed a keen interest in mobile app development for a while, my interest was piqued when I first found out about the internship.\nBut then, I had lingering doubts about registering for this programme.\nWhen I mention to others that this is a year-long internship, I usually get looks of astonishment and disbelief. Most internships in polytechnics are typically four to six months long.\nI also had reservations about spending my last poly year in an internship, after already having spent the last two years studying from home.\nI wanted to, at the very least, experience the “normal” poly life by studying and hanging out with friends on campus before my graduation.\nAnd while my peers are on their semester breaks, going out and having fun, I would still be at work.\nNevertheless, after giving it much thought, I decided that an internship would be good for my career, especially in today’s competitive environment.\nIn a time and age when working adults are heading back to schools as part of Singapore’s lifelong learning push, I thought the other way round — with students building their careers early in actual workplaces — was also important.\nI felt that a year-long experience in the corporate world would greatly benefit me as I could put into practice the skills I learnt in school.\nWith only 20 spots available for the Ignite programme’s pioneer batch of interns, securing a spot was rather competitive and all interested students had to demonstrate coding abilities and project management skills through a hackathon organised by NP.\nThankfully, my team and I managed to do well in the hackathon with the help of my lecturer, Dr Joel. We developed a website and mobile solution that shortened the time needed to create a joint banking account.\nIt is now my 10th month into the internship. \nAs part of the mobile development team in OCBC’s group operations and technology division, I get to work on introducing new features to the bank’s business banking mobile apps, develop skills learnt in school, understand industry standards and get the latest updates on enterprise technology.\nI was able to apply the things I learnt from my polytechnic modules like the mobile application development and solutions design and development classes I attended in my first and second years in NP.\nThese skills I learnt from school helped me to understand technical concepts and the process behind designing an IT solution.\nSeveral months into my internship, I was given a task to revamp one of the features in the OCBC business banking mobile application, and I worked with my colleagues to create a better user experience for customers using the application.\nOne thing I have learnt, coming from the perspective of a “Covid-19 student”, is the mantra that work happens in person.\nMy colleagues and I have the option to work from home, but on most days, I choose to commute from my home in Jurong to OCBC’s offices in Tampines every weekday, despite the long commuting hours. \nThere are so many benefits: from being able to discuss difficult coding tasks in person, to the celebrations shared when my colleagues and I solve a bug on an app.\nDespite being a “mere intern”, I felt a sense of pride that I have participated in something bigger than myself by helping to improve something that actual customers use. \nIt is not something that I would have experienced had I just stayed in school, and is certainly an experience I can take with me and speak about in future job interviews.\nIn any case, it feels as though I have already embarked on my first “real” job, since I no longer need to return to school for classes once I complete this internship.\nThe past ten months have been invaluable to my personal growth into adulthood, all thanks to the guidance of my colleagues at the bank and my academic supervisor at NP, Mr Andy.\nIt is their spirit that drives me forward, and I will cherish these experiences when I begin my actual career elsewhere.\n \nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nChua Jun Hong, 18, is a third-year Ngee Ann Polytechnic student studying information technology, and is also an OCBC Ignite intern."

            "Article Body": "My grandmother always holds my hand when we cross the road.\nIt’s a habit from when I was between four and six, back when I was not yet able to go to the neighbourhood hawker centre by myself.\nAt traffic lights, she’d grasp my hand tightly, and remind me that the red man meant “stop” and the green man meant “go”, that I had to look left and right, and that I wasn’t allowed to let go of her hand at all. Not until she said it was okay.\nBack then, I had to reach up to hold her hand. In my memory, I always looked up at my Ah Ma.\nShe never loomed over me, or seemed too big or too grand, but there was always this slight sense of awe — that this elderly lady was so much older and so much wiser, and someone I could trust to lead me safely.\nGrowing up, I always knew that my Ah Ma loved me.\nShe never said it much — verbal declarations of love were never really a huge thing for her. Instead, she showed it in the little things.\nIn primary school, my younger brother and I were almost always at my Ah Ma’s house. She’d make us lunch after the school bus dropped us off, convinced that the portions served in the school canteen weren’t enough to sustain us.\nThere’s a Bible verse to describe love: “Love is patient, love is kind, it does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.”\nIn Ah Ma’s case, love is also strict. It makes sure that homework is always completed before play, that toys are kept before dinner, and that children are obedient and polite.\nBut her love is also gentle — combing my hair after a shower to ensure that there were no split ends, feeding me snacks as I did my homework, softly patting my back until I fell asleep.\nSometimes, though, I wish talking to her was easier.\nAh Ma’s first language is Hokkien, and she also speaks Malay, Mandarin, and a handful of other dialects. She understands the bare bones of English — those commonly used words like “school” and “apple” and other things that get said often around her.\nIn contrast, English is my first language. I can hold a conversation in Mandarin, yes, tripping over my words slightly and struggling through the different tones.\nI can understand bits and bobs of dialect, but I’m hopeless at navigating a conversation without the help of somebody else.\nThis language barrier is one of the biggest stumbling blocks in our relationship.\nWhen I was a child, conversations about watering the plants or common household chores were elementary. I’d jabber away in a mixture of Mandarin and English, and Ah Ma would simply just understand.\nLife was a lot simpler, so communication was also easier.\nBut as I grew up, it has become difficult. Talking to my Ah Ma can turn into an extremely unsatisfying game of broken telephone, going back and forth as we try to decipher the meaning behind each other's words.\nThis only gets worse with more complex topics, especially social issues that youth are passionate about.\nUnderstanding mental wellness, for example, is not as simple as using the Mandarin word or phrase for the topic.\nThings get lost in translation when I explain to her about the importance of mental health, and how it permeates our emotional, psychological, and social well-being, even in a language that she knows well.\nTime and time again, I run into the same issue — trying to explain why something matters to me as Ah Ma looks on in patient confusion.\nIt’s not that she doesn’t care, or that she’s not smart enough, because she certainly is. But I think she doesn’t understand it the same way I do because we were brought up differently.\nAh Ma was born in 1941 in tumultuous times. She was the eldest daughter in a poor family that lived in a kampung and has no formal education. She became a seamstress by trade, and eventually married my Ah Gong, a construction worker who hailed from Fujian.\nAs my family tells me, Ah Ma grew up worried about earning money, about sending her children to school and making sure that there would be food on the table each day.\nI am fascinated by the stories of her life because they tell me about Ah Ma before I was born.\nShe was the strict mother who pushed her children to study, the thrifty wife that ensured that her family’s needs would always be met.\nTo me, she has always been my sweet grandmother, and it’s so strange to imagine her going through the long, hard life she had before I came along. At times, I wonder how she sees me in return — will I always be the baby she first held years ago, no matter how much I've grown? \nI was born in 2003, just over sixty years later. I’m also the eldest daughter and my family lives in an apartment.\nI've never had to even consider giving up my studies to support them, and I can study what I’m passionate about and look for a job in that field.\nMy concerns are more abstract, in a sense. I’m worried about small things, like which university I’ll go to, and how much schoolwork I have, and I’m worried about big things, like global warming and social media addiction and all those other issues that seem to keep popping up.\nWe both care about current affairs or the world around us, but I think it matters to us both in a different way.\nAh Ma’s life centred around her day-to-day struggle, and even now, she only remembers historical events in the way they relate to her life.\nSo, the rise and fall of the Berlin wall? To her, it is irrelevant, despite it being a major historical event. Singapore’s “Two is Enough” campaign? Well, it happened when my uncle was born, and she recalls being told off by nurses for having a third child.\nI can’t blame my Ah Ma for not being interested in the issues that I feel so strongly about, in the same way that she doesn’t blame me for being able to empathise with the problems she had in her life.\nIs it selfish, I once asked a friend, to want her to care about the same issues as I do? Should I just confine my conversations with Ah Ma to banal retellings of what I did over the week?\nA part of me recoils at the thought. Ah Ma has always been the person that I’ve gone running to when in trouble, and she’s always significant in my life.\nI want her to know about the things that I care about. But as I grow older, I also want to learn about her view of the world too.\nIt is about mutual respect, and love, and wanting to do the best thing for the other in our own way.\nRecently, I bought coffee for Ah Ma — an iced vanilla latte with oat milk. Half of those words are English gibberish to her, but she took a sip anyway.\nShe grimaced and said that it was too bitter and too cold and eventually she told me that I should drink more warm water instead of ‘kopi peng’ (ice coffee).\nIt wasn’t about getting her to like the same coffee as me. It was about letting her have a taste of something that I enjoy, and leaving it at that.\nI know that she loves me, and because of this, she cares about my life and the things that I like. I will keep trying to bridge the gap with her, to ask her about her life and find our common ground.\nShe is now 81, while I am 19.\nThese days, I’m much taller than her, and a far cry from the six-year-old who she had to escort safely across the road to get to the hawker centre.\nIt’s a sign of the times — a natural progression over the years that shows itself in the little things.\nIt’s also a reminder that as a young adult, I am capable of helping her in the same way she once helped me.\nNowadays, I slow my steps to match her pace, just as she did to match mine when I was smaller. I reach out to carry her groceries, the same way she always reached out to carry my school bag in the past.\nBut Ah Ma still holds my hand when we cross the road.\nEven now, she runs through her checklist of reminders before we cross the road: Look both ways, don’t cross before it turns green, don’t stop to pick up anything lest I get hit by a car, and don’t let go of her hand.\n \nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nHana Chen, 19, is a third-year student in the diploma of communications and media management in Temasek Polytechnic."

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "As a seven-year-old kid who was just entering primary school, I remember being dismissive when my parents told me: \"Your studies are the most important — you don't want to end up like me.\"\nI was a stubborn and naive child then, but that did not stop my parents from enrolling me in a reputable primary school, thanks to my mother's volunteer work.\nEveryone was over the moon for me because it seemed like I hopped on a steady train towards success. My parents, aunts and uncles gushed about my acceptance into this school, as if I will surely make it in life.\nBut I was never going to be the brightest kid in class, and I was filled with doubts about my ability to learn.\nRight when I started primary school, my parents also signed me up for piano, swimming and abacus classes. I was a jack of all trades and a master of none.\nI remember the tears dripping onto my piano after a failed practice session as a seven-year-old. This was the piano that my mother bought for me using her yearly bonus.\nI remember thinking that something was wrong with me, that I could never do anything well. After all, it's me.\nLittle did I know that at my new primary school, I would be surrounded by child prodigies, national athletes and mini geniuses. Compared to them, I was a black sheep.\nMy grades continued to plummet after each year. Cs and Ds printed like clockwork on my report cards, and I didn't possess any remarkable accomplishments in my extracurricular activities.\nOther kids would mock me for not understanding concepts as quickly as them, and would jokingly call me names like \"slow\", \"stupid\" or \"dumb\".\nI remember brushing it off and laughing in front of them, but behind closed doors, I was miserable. The criticism had come from people I regarded as friends, and their words were like a stab in the chest.\nFoolishly, I believed them.\nI remember crying every day on my bedroom floor, dreading school, and turning to computer games when I should be studying for examinations.\nBy the time I got to Primary 5, my parents got worried by my academic performance, especially as the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) neared.\nSo, I received extensive private tutoring in English, Mathematics, Chinese, and Science. Separately, my teachers also sent me to remedial classes for almost all my subjects due to my poor results.\nIn these classes, whatever my teacher taught sounded like she was teaching a completely foreign language.\n\"What am I studying for?\" I kept wondering.\nI looked at my answer script. Blank. Nothing came to mind. I didn't want to do this. Because whenever I thought I had moved one step forward, I was ten steps behind.\nOn November 25, 2015, I received my PSLE results. I scored a 198.\n\"With your aggregate, you can go to either the Express or Normal (Academic) stream,\" my form teacher said to me then.\nTo me, it meant choosing between an Express class, where I will once again be at the bottom of the pack; or accepting the much-maligned label of the Normal (Academic) stream.\nThe number \"198\" pierced my mind.\nI rushed to the nearest bathroom, locked myself in one of the cubicles and started breaking down hysterically. I could only imagine how disappointed my parents were. I thought about my father, who always said \"clever girl\" when calling out to me.\nAt that moment, I felt like a pathetic and incompetent failure. I thought that I had come to a dead end at 12 years’ old.\nBut life goes on, and I ended up in the Normal (Academic) stream.\nAlthough unsaid by my peers at the time, I could feel a social stigma around us, because it was easy to be looked down on by some Express stream kids.\nYet, my alma mater — Zhonghua Secondary School — taught me grit, and that nothing is out of reach. I learnt how to find the motivation to put in the hard work to get to any destination I set for myself.\nI had a eureka moment.\nIt wasn't my mental capacity or competence that was at fault. Rather, it was my attitude that needed to change.\nI wanted to prove everyone who ever doubted me wrong. I would work twice as hard as everyone else to keep up. Who knows where that would lead? Perhaps I would surprise myself.\nI thought: \"I can, and I will.\"\nI felt everything change around me right after I made my own determination to do better for myself.\nInstead of hiding away in the crowd during morning assemblies, I would be on the sidelines with my subject teacher each morning, discussing my past examination mistakes.\nWhen school was over, the school bell didn't dismiss me. Instead, I would only leave when I completed my homework.\nI would be exhausted when I reached home, but re-energised when I think about how there is a more intelligent, faster, and harder worker than me.\nEvery day, I challenged myself. To be better than who I was yesterday. One step at a time, until what used to be a chore became a familiar routine.\nSlowly but surely, I saw my first \"A\" in my result slip. The gratification from achieving something I've worked so hard for was indescribable.\nI became at the top of my class, and then the top in the cohort for Normal (Academic) students. I also received a scholarship from my secondary school, the Chuang Yong Eng Scholarship.\nWith an almost perfect N-Level aggregate of six points, I entered the Polytechnic Foundation Programme. The scheme is a through-train programme for the top Normal (Academic) students in the cohort to enter polytechnic.\nBy the time I finished secondary school, I was astonished at how a change in my work ethic and attitude was able to take me. Two years into the polytechnic, I was on the director's list, which is meant for the top five per cent of my cohort. I scored a cumulative grade point average of 3.9 out of four.\nLooking back, I know that I have made the 12-year-old me proud.\n \nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nShina Tan, 19, is studying Communications and Media Management at Temasek Polytechnic, and currently runs a small business selling crystals and handmade jewellery online."

            "Article Body": "Singapore has about 450 active ground-up initiatives, made up of groups of individuals who come together in self-organised projects to help the community. TODAY's Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young changemakers and the stories behind their initiatives. \nHere, Ms Tamara Tan Ann, 24, recounts her journey with 32 Pages, an initiative that aims to provide empathetic spaces for children to learn. What began as a volunteering stint blossomed into a programme that reshaped Miss Tan’s own narrative about her childhood.  \nI was not always drawn to children. There was a time I disliked them and saw them as immature, entitled and unmanageable. \nThis might sound strange coming from a co-founder of 32 Pages — a ground-up initiative started in 2021 that helps children build motivation and resilience in learning. \nMy change of heart was a surprise to me, too. It all began with serving children in the community.\nAs a psychology undergraduate in 2021 who was yearning for hands-on experience in the field, I sought internships that would equip me with the tools to provide therapeutic support to children and adolescents in the future.\nAfter learning ways to manage children’s behaviour and nurture their socio-emotional development, I was eager to apply these skills in a relevant setting.\nFast-forward to 2024 — Chloe Ng, Cheryl Lee and I have been running 32 Pages for nearly three years.\nWhat began as a volunteering stint to serve communities living in rental flats and to hone my skills soon morphed into a profound journey that reshaped not only my perception of children, but also the course of my career.\nOur initial programme, Little Readers: Big Dreams, focused mainly on English literacy for children aged four to 10.\nIt was met with tantrums, inattention and other classroom avoidant behaviours that tested our teaching prowess.\nThis pushed us to confront a pressing need we saw within children in these communities — emotional resilience.\nRecognising this gap, we modified the programme to integrate socio-emotional growth as well, to develop motivation and resilience in learning among children.\nWhile our curriculum incorporates diverse tools — ranging from storybooks and worksheets to crafts and games — the crux of our approach centres on adult modelling.\nWe see ourselves as our children’s role models, leading by example to show them how to navigate the world with empathy and resilience. In essence, we as adults shape their journey through our own actions and examples.\nToday, 32 Pages has served more than 100 children across three neighbourhoods — Redhill, Henderson and Bukit Panjang — with the help of a supportive voluntary community of more than a dozen members who feel as strongly about our children’s potential.\nWe have also received support from partners such as South Central Community Family Service Centre, Leng Kee Community Club, and We Love Learning Centre, among others.\nThe most impactful story for me comes from my interaction with a five-year-old boy who quickly became the nightmare of every volunteer during our time at Bukit Merah. He was the “naughty kid”, “problematic child” and “hyperactive boy”.\nIt was difficult to work with him; he was disobeying instructions by refusing to sit properly and not taking part in our activities. It was after working with him for quite some time that I realised the problem. We were not listening to him.\nI should have known this; I was once a child who felt like her opinions were sidelined and actions were misinterpreted as defiance. \nRather than reprimanding him for his outbursts, I made it a point to sit with him and hear his side of the story. Over time, as I listened, he reciprocated in engagement and participation, and even began to enjoy our shared reading sessions.\nMy experience at 32 Pages has taught me that children fall behind not for a lack of resources, but because they associate learning spaces with negative experiences and feelings. \nThe places we inhabit and the people we meet influence the stories we tell ourselves — about who we are and the people we can become.\nThat is why we also train our volunteers to build meaningful relationships and hone emotional literacy — to allow children to feel heard in their struggles.\nOther times, the struggles we faced were more practical.\nOur programme relies heavily on the dedication of our volunteers, who enable us to provide one-to-one support for our children. Yet, sustaining this weekly commitment over a 10-week period, alongside full-time studies or jobs, is no easy task.\nWhat keeps us going is the improvement we see in children, such as witnessing them take deep breaths to soothe tantrums and having them share their lives, worries and aspirations with us.\nFor children, suppressing these feelings translates into “challenging behaviour”. Instead of recoiling at such outbursts, I have found it empowering to treat these moments as opportunities for understanding what might be holding them back from learning.\nWe believe our work also helps build up a generation of adults who can provide an empathetic space for children to grow. It not only encourages us to withhold personal judgement and model empathy towards children, but also towards ourselves.\nOver time, I’ve come to realise: I didn’t like children. It was because I felt disliked as a child. This was a personal narrative that fuelled my desire to support others who shared similar experiences.\nHowever, even though personal stories inspire us to foster change, it’s the stories born from that change that will keep us going.\nAs changemakers, instead of dwelling on our personal past, we should focus on future narratives — new narratives that unfold within the lives of those we serve, the volunteers who join us in our mission, and even deep within ourselves.  \n\nABOUT THE WRITER: \nTamara Tan Ann, 24, is the co-founder of 32 Pages and works full-time as an associate psychologist. She graduated from the National University of Singapore in 2023 with a psychology major and communications and new media minor.

            "Article Body": "I refer to TODAY’s report on why the 2026 Commonwealth Games is struggling to find a host.\nWith the 2026 games seemingly doomed to be cancelled due to lack of a host, the Commonwealth of Nations may want to consider decentralising future events to several host cities instead.\nThis can significantly reduce the costs of hosting the games, particularly the need to  build new facilities which risks being underutilised after the event.\nSeveral different cities, or even small nations, can bid for hosting of one or more sports which they have more confidence in managing.\nIt could be a discipline popular in their own country or region, or a case of them having existing infrastructure that are well placed to host the events.\nGiven the global spread of Commonwealth countries, it should not be too difficult to find various hosts that can accommodate a schedule where the weather is conducive for competing.\nWhile the economic benefits are less for the individual hosts, so are the costs and risks.  With different events conducted simultaneously in different cities, the Games can be completed in a shorter period too than the typical 10 days or more presently.\nWhile it means sportsmen and sportswomen from different disciplines may be in separate parts of the world, it may allow greater interaction among the fewer numbers onsite at each host city. \nUltimately, this approach provides opportunities for more cities and countries to host events of the Commonwealth Games and encourage participation from those which have never done so.\nSome dilution of commercial sponsorship can be expected, but this may spur more attention on the sports themselves and enjoyment of simpler but more personal experiences of bringing people together.\nThere is no way for the Commonwealth Games to compete with the Olympics, or specialised sporting events like World Aquatics or the World Cup for football.\nPerhaps a paradigm shift to focus more on member participation and meaningful camaraderie will help it establish its own niche to remain relevant.\nHave views on this issue or a news topic you care about?

TODAY’s Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young Singapore residents who have chosen careers in manual trades and are thriving. \nHere, Mr Vigneshwaran Gunasegaran, 39, talks about his transition from an army regular to a career in the rail industry. The Institute of Technical Education graduate, who has spent 10 years with train operator SMRT, works the graveyard shift and oversees track access for engineers and technicians.\n\nI started my career as an army regular, serving as an infantry leader and then a trainer at the Specialist Cadet School.\nAfter a decade of service, I embarked on a transformative career shift from carrying rifles to holding a portable radio to manage MRT track access with train operator SMRT.\nDuring my army days, I had fond memories of the years when I took the first train in the morning from Paya Lebar to Joo Koon station to report for duty at Pasir Laba Camp.\nI have always been amazed by the punctuality of our trains and the smoothness of the rides captivated me, instilling a deep appreciation for the efficiency of the rail services. It was this admiration that spurred my decision to join the rail industry and contribute to its excellence.\nMarch 10, 2024 marked a significant milestone as I celebrated my 10th anniversary at SMRT Trains.\nI started out as a technical officer in a team overseeing re-signalling work and my duties included testing communications-based train control.  \nIn 2018, I switched to a new role to become a ground controller.\nThis involved coordinating track access at a specific interchange station along the North-South East-West Line.\nContinuing my journey of professional growth, I moved the following year to work in the Operation Control Centre, where I currently serve as a track access controller.\nIn this role, I am tasked with controlling and authorising track access of all stations on the North-South East-West Line and ensuring adherence to safety protocols when SMRT engineers and technicians carry out their daily maintenance on the tracks, which is in the middle of the night when the trains are not running. \nI monitor track access by using the company’s Track Access Management System which gives me a clear overview of my colleagues on the tracks as well as their movements, so that I can ensure that these abide by safety protocols.\nBefore track access is given at any point, I have to go through various levels of checks with my colleagues in the Operations Control Centre to ensure that traction power is off, safety protection arrangements are in place and engineering trains stabled at worksite.\nOtherwise, this would mean that my colleagues could be exposed to a risk of electrocution at the trackside and be seriously injured.\nMy highest education qualification is a National ITE Certification in Electronics Engineering (Computer Technology) from the Institute of Technical Education but I hope to be able to pursue a diploma related to rail engineering through a SMRT’s educational advancement programme in the near future.\nBalancing the demands of night shifts with familial responsibilities has been challenging but fulfilling.  Since my job requires me to work from about 9pm to 6am in the morning, I plan my schedule well in order to manage my work and spend time with family and friends.\nIt was initially not easy as my children were young when I first joined SMRT, but with proper time management, I was able to juggle both my work and family responsibilities. I’m lucky that my family and friends see my passion and commitment towards work and support me wholeheartedly. \nAs I work at night, I must constantly be alert and attentive on duty as any delay in my response to any track-related issue could impact the safety and timeliness of our operations.\nAlthough my job may be considered a blue-collared one, I find it rewarding because I can see tangible results from my efforts.\nFrom safeguarding colleagues on the tracks to ensuring seamless journeys for commuters, each day presents an opportunity to make a meaningful difference.\nLooking back at my journey in SMRT, I am constantly reminded of the profound impact our work has on the community.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER:\nVigneshwaran Gunasegaran was an army regular for 10 years before he joined SMRT, where he is now a track access controller. Married with two children, his hobbies are bowling and badminton."

This made me consider doing something that was skills-based at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE), instead of continuing with my O-Levels.\nA new hairdressing course at ITE College East caught my eye.\nAt first, my parents were sceptical when I told them of my choice. They felt hairdressing was not a reputable industry and were worried for me.\nI explained to them the possibilities if I became a successful hairstylist, and they relented.\nHaving seen how far I’ve come, I think they are relieved that I’m doing well.\nI started my Nitec in Hair Fashion and Design in 2008.\nIt was tough at first — cutting hair is not as easy as it seems! My lecturers kept lessons enjoyable though. \nThe facilities at ITE — including a fully-equipped salon where we could learn everything from hair styling to colouring — also helped keep me motivated, as did the support I got.\nBack then, I practised on my family and friends — cutting their hair along a HDB corridor, with perspiration and hair all over my face. I supposed they liked it since they came back for more. That gave me more confidence to pursue my “art”.\nIn 2010, I was selected to be part of Team Singapore at the 8th WorldSkills Asean in Bangkok and pit my hairdressing skills against other youths in the region. I had to train intensively before that, and I’m proud that it paid off — I earned a Gold medal.\nIn 2011, I travelled to London for the WorldSkills’ international leg. This meant competing with the top-performing youths of each participating country. It was an eye-opening experience being able to represent Singapore on the global stage. I was glad to bring home a Medallion for Excellence.\nI completed my first Nitec in 2010, and graduated with my second in hair and scalp therapy in 2012. \nMy first job was a hair assistant. I was later promoted to stylist and moved around a few salons over the next few years. However, it was always my dream to open my own salon.\nIn 2016, that dream finally came true. With some savings, and plenty of support from my family, I opened Harts Salon in Bugis.\nAs a salon owner, I have a lot more responsibilities. I have to provide for my team, get customers in, manage people, and generally make sure things run smoothly.\nTo attract customers, I turned to social media marketing, showcasing our services and whatever was trending in the industry.\nThe effort paid off and soon, I was getting back-to-back appointments.\nBefore I expanded, I was attending to three to seven customers a day. It was a challenge to meet their expectations and I did worry at times that they would not like what I have done for them.\nThese days, my challenge lies more with managing and training my team of stylists. I started out with a team of four and I’ve steadily expanded it to 24 across three salons.\nWith a large team like this, it’s not easy paying attention to the individual stylist’s performance, but I try my best.\nI’m still growing and seeking out new ideas so I can stay ahead in the industry, for example by keeping in touch with the latest hairstyle trends.\nOperations-wise, I make sure there is transparency, and emphasise the need for good customer service among my team.\nAs an ITE graduate, I’m committed to nurturing talent and providing opportunities for fellow alumni in the industry. For example, before Covid-19 hit I was going back to ITE on an ad-hoc basis to share my experience with students. \nI have also hired some ITE grads at my salon, and I'm proud that a few of them have advanced to higher positions elsewhere! \nFor those looking to join the industry, you must enjoy hairdressing. When you start out, you are at the bottom rung but with perseverance and determination, you can be successful.\nABOUT THE WRITER:\nNoel Ng, 31, is the owner of Harts Salon located in Bugis. He also co-owns Hint Salon at Tanjong Pagar and Hei Ardour at Orchard Road. He believes that a good hairstylist is like a surgeon operating on hair — and can earn just as much as one. Outside of work, his favourite pastime is searching for good food.\nIf you have an experience to share or know someone who wishes to contribute to this series, write to voices@mediacorp.com.sg with your full name, address and phone number."

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "I was recently retrenched. This came as a shock to me as I had been in a senior leadership role for nearly three years and had brought in significant revenue for my employer — a global company in the creative industry.\nI was informed that the reason for my retrenchment was “financial challenges” and it was not a “reflection of my past performance or contributions”.\nI asked about severance benefits, and was told I would not be getting any because the company was “not in a financially healthy position”.\nI have appealed for a payout in line with the Ministry of Manpower (MOM)’s recommendations — generally up to a months’ salary per year of service for employees who have served for at least two years — and am still waiting for a response. \nRetrenchment benefits are not enshrined in Singapore’s labour laws.\nAs mentioned, MOM gives only broad guidelines. Any severance amount depends on what is provided for in one’s employment contract, or paid out of good will — not because of legislation.\nSadly, my contract didn’t include any such provision.\nA friend urged me to speak with the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management who referred me to the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices.\nBoth officers who spoke with me were sympathetic but ultimately said the same thing my company’s Human Resources told me — that they can only point my company to best practices — and could not enforce anything.\nMy story isn’t the only one.\nThe recent high-profile retrenchments at Lazada and Google have exposed a weakness in Singapore’s labour laws, which experts acknowledge are geared towards supporting companies.\nIn the case of Google, affected staff were luckily offered a package that was “comparable” to retrenchment benefits in the United States.\nIn Lazada’s case, employees were offered two weeks’ salary per year of service. The Food Drinks and Allied Workers Union, which represents its workers, is pushing for more.\nFor perspective, I’ve worked as a Singaporean in Britain and Australia. Both these countries do have workplace laws that protect employees in the event of retrenchment.\nIn Australia for example, if you are made redundant, there is provision of at least four weeks’ pay if you have worked with a company for at least a year.\nIn Britain, employees get a payout if they’ve been working for a company for two years or more. This ranges from half a week’s pay to one-and-a-half week’s pay per full year of work, depending on age.\nThese practices give employees a safety net so that they can continue meeting financial obligations while searching for new jobs.\nAs a country that has ambitions to be a regional business hub, I urge MOM to strengthen the legal protection for employees here.  \nIf we are unable to strike a fair balance in the employment relationship, I worry about how competitive we will be in attracting and retaining global talents.\nHave views on this issue or a news topic you care about?

            "Article Body": "Singaporeans are increasingly seeking out meaningful, skilled labour, amid a growing push for better recognition and pay for such professions. TODAY’s Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young Singapore residents who have chosen careers in manual trades and are thriving. \nHere, Mr Ho Boon Ping, 34, who started an air-con servicing business in 2019, recounts the highs and lows of his journey. After seeing how blue-collar roles are in demand overseas, he says that they deserve the same recognition in Singapore.\n \nWhen I was young, I thought studies were not important and neglected them. Not surprisingly, my N-Level results were not great.\nWhile browsing through the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) website for courses I could apply for, it occurred to me that with Singapore being such a hot and humid country, we can’t live without air-conditioning.\nSo I opted for a Nitec in Facility Technology (Air-Conditioning & Refrigeration), which I started in April 2010. \nDuring the course, I went on an exchange programme at Box Hill Institute in Melbourne, Australia, where I saw women and many locals in blue-collar jobs.\nI was even more surprised to hear that plumbers, electricians, and HVAC (heating, ventilation and air-conditioning) technicians were in demand in Australia.\nIt made me hope that such jobs can achieve the same level of recognition in Singapore. \nIn May 2013, I started working for Stulz (Singapore) — a German air-conditioning services firm — as a service engineer.\nDuring my interview, I frankly told the hiring manager that I did not have much experience. He was more than willing to train me, so I got the job. \nThere, I learnt a lot about computer room air-conditioning and how temperature, humidity and airflow can affect machine performance. \nStulz also sent me to Hamburg, Germany, for a week of training at its headquarters.\nIt was an eye-opening experience. There, I also noticed that many of their technicians are locals as well.\nI stayed on with Stulz for six years, during which I also completed a part-time Higher Nitec in Marine and Offshore Technology as well as a part-time diploma in Building Services and Fire Safety from Ngee Ann Polytechnic. \nIn 2018, my sister was hospitalised for eight weeks due to a lung infection. She couldn’t work after that and had to depend on the family.\nThat was when I started thinking about leaving my comfort zone to help take care of my sister.\nI didn’t plan much — I resigned in May 2019 to look after her and rest. It was then that I decided to set up my own business as I love hands-on work and going to different job locations. \nIn December 2019, I started Comfort Cooling Services, which provides air-conditioning and repair services.\nUnfortunately, Covid-19 struck just two months later. During the lockdown, I did some freelance work in building and servicing to get by. \nFrom there, I slowly built my customer base. I had zero connections so it wasn’t until mid-2021 that I started getting regular clients.\nI know many people are sceptical when engaging contractors to service their air-conditioners. I told myself I had to build up a business that provides honest and quality service. \nMy ITE lecturers taught me good installation work, and I used that to guide me while building my business. \nWhen my customers engage my services, I won’t push unnecessary add-ons such as topping up refrigerant gas annually. \nThis is a common contractor suggestion that is not necessary as long as the air-conditioner is installed properly and working fine. \nA typical day will see me servicing air-conditioners at different locations and sometimes meeting new customers, who get to know of me through word-of-mouth.\nIt’s very satisfying for me as I feel that I learn something new every day, even though I have been doing this for a while.\nMy biggest challenge is having to get over my fear of heights, especially when I have  customers in older Housing and Development Board flats with no air-conditioner ledge.\nI have to use a safety harness to climb out of the flat to check or top up the refrigerant.\nIt gives me great satisfaction when my customers give me good feedback on my work, and when I manage to solve their air-conditioning problems.\nTo me, machines can’t do a hands-on job like mine. You need to be able to think on your feet. I feel that there will be great demand for skilled workers (plumbers, electricians, HVAC technicians and so on), especially when fewer people are taking up such jobs.\nFor those thinking of going into this line, have faith in your skill and do what you are happy with.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER:\nHo Boon Ping, 34, runs his own business — Comfort Cooling Services — and provides air-conditioning and handyman services such as plumbing, replacing of taps, water tank accessories, and electrical switches.\nIf you have an experience to share or know someone who wishes to contribute to this series, write to voices@mediacorp.com.sg with your full name, address and phone number."

            "Article Body": "Singaporeans are increasingly seeking out meaningful, skilled labour, amid a growing push for better recognition and pay for such professions. TODAY’s Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young Singapore residents who have chosen careers in manual trades and are thriving. \nHere, Mr Kwek Siew Bo, 39, recounts how he had to start working after finishing polytechnic to support his family. Despite giving up his further studies, Mr Kwek found a rewarding career at SMRT, where he was involved in setting up a new train depot and delving into the intricacies of operating new trains.\n\nI graduated with a diploma in Electronic and Computer Engineering from Ngee Ann Polytechnic in 2011 and planned to further my studies.\nMy family, however, was struggling to make ends meet and could not afford university tuition fees. So, I joined the workforce straight after graduation to help support them. \nI was disappointed, but little did I realise that this would set me on a path to something meaningful and rewarding. \nAs I was strongly inclined towards hands-on work in school, I started my career as a technician at Hewlett-Packard, working in a team responsible for producing printer heads. \nAfter my contract ended, I joined SMRT Trains in 2014 as an assistant engineer. \nPart of my role involved doing preventive and corrective maintenance. It involved tasks such as troubleshooting faults, replacing worn and defective parts, and periodic cleaning of equipment. \nSwitching industries and adjusting to a new environment and demands was challenging initially. \nFortunately, the company provided me with a six-month training programme to equip me with the skills necessary to perform my role.    \nLeading a team of two technical officers proved challenging too, as effective communication with other teams was essential to support train service.   \nOver time, I overcame these communication challenges by taking notes and clarifying with my supervisors and colleagues any areas I was unsure of to better understand how to perform the work competently. \nIn 2017, I had the opportunity to help establish a new base of operations in the newly built Tuas Depot. I volunteered to be part of the pioneer trainborne signalling team there. \nSetting up a new depot was exhilarating. \nIt involved installing new workspaces and workflows to commission trains with new Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC) systems installed. \nSimply put, CBTC is a railway signalling system that uses telecommunications for train management and control. It is an upgrade from traditional fixed block signalling systems which detect trains in discrete sections of the track. \nTrains had to be retrofitted for the new system and I was involved in the commissioning of the equipment needed. I also ensured that it was properly installed and helped to test it to make sure it was functional. \nEvery early morning, before the launch of the day’s train service, we needed to make sure there were sufficient serviceable trains. \nI was promoted last July to the position of deputy engineering maintenance manager and am now leading trainborne signalling and communications maintenance operations at SMRT’s Ulu Pandan Depot. \nI now supervise a team of assistant engineers and technical officers to manage train-related maintenance. \nNot only do I ensure that we have the resources required, I’m also responsible for their safety and welfare. I assist my team with the more complex faults that may require an experienced eye. I also provide recommendations to the management regarding train faults and recovery. \nThis significant change in my life has opened doors to strengthen relationships with colleagues and build wide networks in the industry. \nMy previous supervisor and I now work together as colleagues at the same professional level. It allowed me to attain a greater appreciation for the work my supervisors had done in the past and the challenges they faced. \nFor those considering a career in the rail and public transport industries, I would say there is a world of diverse opportunities. \nMy career in SMRT has enabled me to meet, interact and learn from professionals from various fields, including the Land Transport Authority, our signalling system supplier Thales, and other contractors. \nI’ve also had the chance to delve into the intricacies of operating new trains and acquire fresh skills that I was not acquainted with previously. \nI may not have been able to further my studies after graduating many years ago, but when I look back, I am glad it led me to this. \nThere is never a dull moment, and the prospect of networking and continuously learning with professionals from different domains, knowing that at the end of the day, commuters are the ultimate beneficiaries with safe, reliable, and comfortable journeys, has made this job truly fascinating, meaningful and rewarding. \n\nABOUT THE WRITER:\nKwek Siew Bo, 39, is a deputy engineering maintenance manager at SMRT’s Ulu Pandan Depot. His hobbies include swimming, playing badminton and going to the movies.\n\nIf you have an experience to share or know someone who wishes to contribute to this series, write to voices@mediacorp.com.sg with your full name, address and phone number."

            "Article Body": "Singaporeans are increasingly seeking out meaningful, skilled labour, amid a growing push for better recognition and pay for such professions. TODAY’s Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young Singapore residents who have chosen careers in manual trades and are thriving. \nHere, Mr Alfred Goh Jie Bin, 38, recounts his unconventional path to becoming a bicycle workshop owner. Mr Goh, who dropped out of school to support his family, learnt the trade from the ground up and later upgraded his skills in the United States. After working at various bicycle shops, and a brief stint in scuba diving, he finally opened his own business in 2019.\nI have loved bicycles since young. \nCycling meant freedom as money was hard to come by. I could get around without worrying about transport fares or timing.  \nMy father died in 1996 when I was 12. My mum had to work, and I took a part-time job as a banquet waiter to help with finances. I would finish late and was too tired for school the next day.  \nAs a result, I got retained in Secondary 2 and left school during my repeat year, when I was 15. My mum was disappointed, but the upside was that I was earning an income which gave us a better quality of life. \nI also had more time to hang around bicycle shops. Slowly, I learnt the ins and outs of the trade.  \nI worked my way up from sales to become a bicycle mechanic in 2002. \nIn 2010, after eight years in the business, I wanted to further my technical knowledge and shop managing skills. I signed up for courses at United Bicycle Institute, an American school for bicycle mechanics.  \nI travelled to their Ashland, Oregon campus on my own dime. My three weeks there cost me around S$15,000, but I felt it was a worthwhile investment.  \nI took a professional repair and shop operation course, followed by various advanced certificates. \nBefore this, I had not travelled much other than visiting family in Malaysia. It was challenging getting used to staying in a lodging with the rest of my coursemates.  \nDuring lessons, I also had to learn industry terms not commonly used in Singapore. Cooking, laundry, grocery shopping and house parties became my life for those weeks. \nArmed with new knowledge and skills, I returned to Singapore looking forward to growing my employer’s business. \nIn 2011, I had the chance to manage their shop operations, but that was short-lived as they closed down two years later. \nWith no education to depend on, I started exploring other options. I did odd jobs such as being a hotel houseman and guest service officer. \nIn mid-2013, I saw an advertisement for a scuba diving apprenticeship, which piqued my interest.  \nI joined a dive centre and worked my way up to become an instructor and later an equipment distribution manager. Sadly, I left in 2016 seeking a more stable and financially rewarding venture. \nI returned to the cycling world, joining up-and-coming shops. I was excited to be back knowing I had the skills and experience to take their business forward.  \nStarting over was difficult, but I persevered. At that point, I was 33 and married. I wished I could do more.  \nIn 2019, I took a leap of faith and opened my own shop. \nTo say that running a business is challenging would be an understatement. The struggles worsened when Covid-19 happened shortly after opening.  \nFortunately, the circuit breaker and border closures encouraged more people to start cycling. \nWith more customers, I faced new challenges being a one-man operation.  \nTo my surprise, former co-workers and customers offered to help. Some had been financially hit and volunteered to do odd jobs. It was a small side income for them, but I was happy to help. \nWith life mostly back to normal now, business is not as brisk as before. Returning customers and recommendations keep me afloat.  \nI am not highly educated so running a small business is a constant challenge. I am lucky I have the support of family and friends whenever I stumble on complex issues such as legal matters. \nA typical day starts with replying customer messages. Wrench work follows, which takes up most of my time, but I do have one staff helping with odd jobs. My day ends with replying to more messages. Staying in touch is vital to get more business. \nMore than two decades ago, I was just a kid cycling for fun. I am still in that world, but happy to be behind the counter. \nMy advice to those looking to enter the industry is to have tenacity and be content. When I was younger, I used to envy others’ success but now I am much happier spending time with family and friends than trying to impress others.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER:  \nMr Alfred Goh Jie Bin, 38, is the owner of bicycle workshop Inkedmechanic. He is also a former scuba diving instructor and has a 20-year-old stepson.\nIf you have an experience to share or know someone who wishes to contribute to this series, write to voices@mediacorp.com.sg with your full name, address and phone number."

TODAY’s Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young Singapore residents who have chosen careers in manual trades and are thriving. \nHere, Ms Tsuri Xie, 34, recounts her career transition from a marketing job to installing vinyl wraps on cars. Drawn to the creative process, she picked up skills and managed to win fans on social media by sharing videos of her work. Negative comments, as well as chauvinism from those who think women know little about cars, don’t discourage her from pursuing her craft, she writes.\nI graduated from Lasalle College of the Arts with a Communication Design degree in 2010. As a student, I envisioned myself entering the creative or media industry. \nI found myself in marketing instead, and after some years landed a senior role in an international company. Despite the attractive compensation, nothing quite satisfied the itch to create.  \nAlong the way, I began investing in startups. In 2016, I invested in a now defunct automotive company called Fox Motorworks. \nThat was where I first encountered vinyl wrapping, and the process intrigued me.\nI began playing around with scrap vinyl material, but not very seriously because it was a lot harder than it looked.\nAmid the pandemic in 2020, I left my job to set up a digital marketing firm.\nThe founders of my current workplace, Vos Automotive, approached me then to join them as a marketer. It was a bold move for me, but the opportunity was a breath of fresh air.\nShortly after, I closed my venture and joined Vos as a founding member.\nLike many businesses, we found it hard to hire skilled labour. This was my chance to start learning vinyl wrapping more seriously.\nAt the end of 2020, I spoke to Vos’ owners about becoming a vinyl wrap installer. They gave me their blessing.\nI began by watching online videos and referencing those techniques against what other seasoned installers were teaching me.  \nI also joined online communities where professional installers share tips with one another.\nThat same year, I started recording videos myself at work for my own review. A friend suggested uploading them onto TikTok. I didn’t think too much of it but did it anyway.\nBefore long, they grew in popularity, garnering millions of views. This gave me the assurance to push myself further. \nThere were also many negative comments, which would affect my mental state adversely, but I tried to take them constructively as much as possible. \nI enjoy seeing every car as a creative canvas. Initially, being able to even complete a job gave me an unparalleled sense of achievement. \nAfter wrapping professionally for three years — and completing over a hundred projects — a finished design is still extremely satisfying to me.  \nSome of my more memorable designs include a graphic anime-styled wrap, a BMW 4 series wrapped in marble print and a Mercedes G-Wagon wrapped in faux leather vinyl. \nA typical day involves planning and measuring the materials used, cleaning, designing and installing. The schedule can be demanding, especially during peak seasons.  \nFortunately, I have a team to assist me. Many of my teammates are my teachers too. \nNew methods are always being discovered. Making progress means being willing to learn — never become the old dog that can’t learn new tricks.  \nUnfortunately, chauvinism is very real in the male-dominated automotive industry.  \nI have encountered many people who assume that women know little about cars. \nI’ve found that I need to prove my worth in this industry, as some clients do not trust a woman to work on their vehicles. \nCreative work is challenging work. While we strive for perfection, anything handmade is hardly perfect. Sadly, not everyone appreciates this and can be overly demanding. \nAdditionally, prejudice against blue-collared work exists in Singapore. I have experienced many white-collared professionals talking down to my team and I.\nIn fact, some who acted like my close friends despised me for going into blue-collared work. There was much chatter about me when I entered this trade.\nThis does not stop me from pursuing my passion. To me, every wrap is a work of art. Seeing a satisfied owner further assures me that my decision was worth it. \nI’m thankful for my friends and family who truly supported me. Today, these are the same people who are telling their friends now they know me personally. \nTo those wanting to enter the trade, be prepared to work on your posture or end up getting endless backaches.  \nBe warned, too, that it is not a financially rewarding trade — the business is hardly scalable and anyone looking to make a quick buck should turn away. Passion is the only thing that will keep your fire going.  \n\nABOUT THE WRITER: \nTsuri Xie, 34, is a Lasalle College of the Arts graduate who is now a vinyl installer,  automotive decorator and designer at Vos Automotive Styling.

TODAY’s Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young Singapore residents who have chosen careers in manual trades and are thriving. \nHere, Ms Kelly Cheah, 31, recounts her unconventional journey from aspiring engineer to head pastry chef at an award-winning cafe. Initially lukewarm about baking, she fell in love with creating pastries and rose up the kitchen ranks, overcoming challenges along the way. \nDespite being a science student and aspiring to follow my father's footsteps as an engineer, my education took an unexpected turn when I ventured into pastry-making.\nIt was not an easy decision, especially when most people wanted to be doctors, lawyers, or engineers. \nI was young at the time, and rather than follow a prescribed path, I wanted to try something different. If it didn’t work out, at least I would have no regrets. \nMy dad, who has always been very supportive of me, suggested that since I love to eat, why not learn how to bake?\nSo, after my SPM exams in Malaysia (the equivalent of the O-Levels) in 2009, I took a gap year to travel around Asia to figure out my next move. \nTo be honest, I didn’t have a huge passion for baking at first, but I did want to get a diploma.\nI went to several pastry schools in Singapore to enquire, but as a foreigner then, it was not cheap to study and stay here. \nIn the end, I chose Shatec because it is a well-known institute, and the fees were more affordable. \nAfter starting my diploma course in pastry and baking in 2011, I discovered a love for the art of pastries. \nI enjoy creating beautiful and delicious desserts to complement a good meal. \nI graduated in 2012 and started as a commis chef at French restaurant DB Bistro & Oyster Bar at Marina Bay Sands that year. It was my first time in a professional kitchen. \nI was taught the importance of being curious and asking “why”. I learned this the hard way when I was reprimanded for not knowing the reasons behind my actions and just going through the motions.\nI also mastered the art of working quickly, as DB Bistro often faced intense rushes during festive seasons. This taught me to multitask and to stay composed even in the face of demanding chefs. \nThe experience prepared me for the high-pressure kitchen at Joel Robuchon Restaurant, which I joined in 2014.\nThere, I delved into the intricacies of French cuisine. I started as a commis 1 chef before being promoted to demi chef in 2015 and later chef de partie in 2016.\nAs all the recipes were in French, reading them became an endeavour that not only expanded my culinary repertoire but also my linguistic abilities.\nI was entrusted with managing desserts and the petit four trolleys, which comprised over 20 bite-sized and classic French desserts that had to be prepared before dinner service began.\nIn 2018, I joined Tarte by Cheryl Koh, a small takeaway shop at Shaw Centre that I helped transform into an award-winning pastry haven. \nI have been Tarte’s head pastry chef since January 2022. \nBalancing the demands of haute cuisine with the challenges of building a brand has been both daunting and immensely rewarding. \nMy day starts at 7am, working in the kitchen to complete morning preparations with my team. Then, I ensure the dining area is ready for guests. \nI experiment with new desserts every week — regardless of whether they are intended for public release. This commitment to innovation remains a pivotal part of my role.\nWe also take pride in using premium ingredients. I could be working with shine muscat grapes from Korea one day and sollies figs from France the next. I believe this approach is what makes our kitchen a culinary hub.\nOn top of that, I'm learning how to manage and make the brand profitable. I've had to delve into budgeting and balance sheets, which were unfamiliar concepts when I was just a chef. \nLeading a team and earning their respect is a new skill I'm also developing.

TODAY’s Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young Singapore residents who have chosen careers in manual trades and are thriving. \nHere, Ms Makesvary Krishnasamy, 22, recounts how she stumbled into a greenery and landscaping course at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE). Over time, she developed a love for plants and the outdoors — much to her family’s surprise — and is now a landscape supervisor deployed at the Singapore Zoo, Night Safari and River Wonders. \nWhen I was younger, I wanted to help people and thought I would pursue a career in social services. Now, I help plants instead!\nI am a landscape supervisor at BNL Services, an environmental services company which provides landscape, cleaning, and waste management services.\nMy team and I look after and inspect the trees and plants at Singapore Zoo, Night Safari and River Wonders.\nA typical day will see me check various trees for defects which might lead to falling branches, or even the whole tree.\nOnce a defect has been spotted, I would need to rectify it. For example, if I spot dead branches on a tree, I will get my team to remove them.\nI love looking after plants and trees and I truly enjoy my work.\nIt wasn’t always like this, though.\nMy N-Level results weren’t great and of the 12 courses I listed in my ITE application, a Nitec in Urban Greenery & Landscape was my last choice. As fate would have it, it was the course I got into at ITE College East.\nI entered the course in 2018, having no idea what it would be like.\nBy actively participating in class and horticultural activities organised by the school and industry, I slowly developed an interest.\nHaving spent time outdoors and figuring out what makes plants tick, I discovered that, “Hey, it’s fun working with plants!”.\nMy lecturer also played a big part in my career choice. Her passion for plants really inspired me — she was the one who showed me how important plants are.\nShe gave me a lot of support while I was studying and created more opportunities for me to gain exposure and build my network in the landscaping industry.\nMy family was surprised when they found out about my interest. They definitely didn’t expect me to be a plant lover since I wasn’t exposed much to nature when I was younger.\nOnce they got used to the idea, they supported my decision to turn this interest into a career. Now, they are proud and happy that I choose to do what I love.\nAfter graduating from my Nitec course, I enrolled in the newly-introduced ITE Work-Study Diploma (WSDip) in Arboriculture & Horticulture in 2020.\nThat was when I joined BNL Services.\nStepping into the work environment as a young trainee, I found it a challenge to work with people of varying field experiences.\nBut I took my time to learn from everyone. I worked hard to prove my capabilities and made sure I bonded with my team so we could all learn from each other.\nThe WSDip course taught me more than just technical knowledge and skills. It also prepared me for the working world by teaching me how to interact with people from different age groups.\nThis particular skillset keeps things interesting for me as well — I meet many people with diverse talents and perspectives in this industry and I really enjoy it.\nIt gives me an opportunity to work with and learn from them. I may work with plants, but there is plenty of human interaction as well!\nI stayed on with BNL after completing my WSDip in 2022. I’m grateful to the company for giving me the opportunity to kick start my career in this industry.\nA highlight of my career so far was getting the chance to represent BNL and showcase the National Parks Board’s digitalisation capabilities to National Development Minister Desmond Lee at this year’s Green Thumbs exhibition.\nI know many girls would prefer not to pursue a career like mine. In this line, you can’t be afraid of working outdoors.\nAs for me, I love being outside and bugs don’t bother me at all. Tree falls happen more frequently during the rainy season, so you’ve got to be prepared to work in the rain too.\nPersonally, I prefer working without a raincoat as I find them quite restrictive.\nMy love for nature goes beyond enjoying beautiful scenery. To me, plants and trees are living things, just like us.\nSo instead of serving humans, I choose to serve plants and trees, despite having to do so under the hot sun for hours.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER:\nMakesvary Krishnasamy, 22, is a landscape supervisor at BNL Services. Though she is just starting out in the industry, she hopes to be a plant and tree specialist in the future. She is currently pursuing a certified arborist licence with the International Society of Arboriculture. At home, she is “mum” to a growing collection of money plants.\nIf you have an experience to share or know someone who wishes to contribute to this series, write to voices@mediacorp.com.sg with your full name, address and phone number."

TODAY’s Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young Singapore residents who have chosen careers in manual trades and are thriving. \nHere, Mr Muhammad Aliff Adha, 33, recounts how he overcame his initial struggles in school to excel in engineering at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE). That foundation later helped him transition from building jet engines to assembling electric vehicles at Hyundai’s robot-operated smart factory.\nWhen I tell people I work at Hyundai, they assume that I work in a car workshop. But after explaining that I assemble electric vehicles (EVs) using robots in a smart factory, their interest is piqued. \nI’m proud to say that I’m part of the Korean company’s only EV manufacturing team in Singapore. \nI wouldn’t be where I am today, if not for my parents’ advice and a supportive learning environment. \nWhen I was in secondary school, I was disappointed when my N-Level results weren’t good enough for me to progress to Secondary 5. \nMy only option then was the Institute of Technical Education (ITE). I wasn’t keen, but with my parents’ advice, I applied for an engineering course at the former Bukit Batok campus in 2007. \nI had difficulty adapting to ITE initially. Thankfully, my lecturers were very patient, guiding me in my lessons and believing that I can do well in my studies. \nI soon found out that I enjoyed engineering and hands-on learning. \nI graduated from my Nitec in Precision Engineering (Machining) in 2009 with a perfect grade point average, and was offered an Economic Development Board (EDB) Scholarship to join the Technical Engineer Diploma (TED) in Machine Technology at ITE. I accepted without hesitation. \nThough the TED course was more theoretical, the lecturers were very supportive and worked tirelessly to ensure that I understood what was being taught. This motivated me to do my best.\nIn 2011, I topped my TED cohort and received a Gold Course Medal.\nMy career journey started in 2014 soon after I completed my National Service. \nI found out that jet engine-maker Rolls-Royce Singapore was willing to accept fresh graduates from ITE. I applied and was accepted in January 2014. I started out as an assembly technician for commercial aircraft engines. \nThen, the Covid-19 pandemic hit. The aviation sector was badly affected, and I was retrenched in August 2021, after 7.5 years. That was the lowest point of my career. \nFortunately, just before the retrenchment exercise, my TED lecturer contacted me and told me there was a career opportunity in Hyundai. I jumped at the chance and was given the role as a senior assembly technician in September 2021. \nAs part of the pioneer batch, I was sent to Daegu, South Korea for three months of training. There, I learnt how to assemble EVs. \nBeing in a smart factory was mind-blowing. I had to work alongside robots and use smart technologies such as artificial intelligence and the internet of things. \nWorking with robots is not as straightforward as one might think. I have to ensure that these high-tech machines are working well during production and that all parts are delivered on time to each step on the assembly line. \nThis was quite challenging for me at first as I was used to manual work from my previous job.\nI had to ensure that I was familiar enough with the robots so I could figure out what the issue was when an error occurred. Then I would rectify it, move the robot to its starting position and restart the process. I also needed to do this quickly enough to minimise delays.\nThankfully, Hyundai provided me with intensive training on how to do basic troubleshooting.\nOnce I got the hang of it, I enjoyed and appreciated the integration of technology in the assembly process. \nIt excites me every time I see how the robots assemble cars. It feels like I’m stepping into a different world! Instead of humans, we have robots moving car components around and assembling them. This greatly reduces our workload and improves productivity. \nOnce completed, these newly assembled cars can be test-driven at the 620m-long track located on the rooftop.\nAfter 1.5 years, I was promoted to production supervisor. My duties now include ensuring that the production line runs smoothly and manpower planning. \nI am learning new things every day, and in future I hope to leverage my technical skills to come up with ideas on new technologies, improve existing ones and drive innovation. \nNo doubt, robots can perform certain tasks better than humans, but tasks that require critical thinking and interpersonal skills will always require a human touch.\nABOUT THE WRITER:  \nMuhammad Aliff Adha, 33, is a production supervisor at Hyundai Motor Group Innovation Center Singapore. He has nearly 10 years of manufacturing experience in both the aviation and automotive industries.\nIf you have an experience to share or know someone who wishes to contribute to this series, write to voices@mediacorp.com.sg with your full name, address and phone number."

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "I refer to the article “Funeral industry encouraged to provide greater price transparency, clarity on packages” (Nov 17).\nA report by the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) last month highlighted the lack of transparency over funeral costs in Singapore. It also encouraged consumers to pre-plan funeral arrangements where possible.\nThe main selling point of pre-paid funerals is that you can plan them to your preferences, without the emotional pressure of dealing with a loved one’s death.   \nHowever, given Singaporeans’ general unfamiliarity with the funeral business, as pointed out by the CCCS report, it might be wiser not to make pre-plans unless certain safeguards are put in place. \nFirst, a central registry of pre-paid funeral contracts should be established to enable consumers, family members and funeral directors to expeditiously verify the details of existing contracts. Individual funeral service providers should also be required to keep records of pre-paid funerals.\nAs a former funeral professional, I have encountered many occasions when a person died and their family members were not aware that a plan existed.\nA 2005 parliamentary inquiry on the funeral industry in Victoria, Australia, found that its system of self-regulation was “unsatisfactory” given the diversity of businesses and lack of agreed industry-wide standards. \nIt added that a voluntary code of practice would not be beneficial without the “support of legislation”. Recommendations from the inquiry have been enshrined in law since 2006. \nIn Singapore, where almost every funeral company is a small or medium-sized enterprise, pre-paid funds meant for future use could well be spent on existing costs. One also cannot rule out the possibility that a firm might exit the business before a package can be used.   \nAs such, monies paid in advance for funeral packages should be placed in an independent investment trust fund, which a funeral director cannot access until the death has occurred.\nThe interest earned from an investment fund could also be used to fund funerals for the destitute.\nWhile pre-planning does allow consumers to make informed decisions, the continual lack of transparency in funeral costs remains a barrier in that decision-making process.\nThus, unless the authorities make it mandatory that prices of funeral goods and services are made transparent and itemised and shared with consumers before a contract is signed, there is a distinct imbalance in favour of an unregulated industry.\nSuch safeguards could be legalised under the ambit of a “Funeral Act”, to govern the entire industry.\nPresently, if one’s concern is the cost of a funeral, it is better to deposit funds in a nominated bank account rather than with a funeral company.\nConsumers can also consider listing out detailed ideas about a funeral in a will after having consulted a funeral firm.\nThis will allow them to reap the benefits of a pre-paid funeral without the drawbacks of being locked into a contract that might eventually not be honoured.\n\nHave views on this issue or a news topic you care about?

TODAY’s Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young Singapore residents who have chosen careers in manual trades and are thriving. \nHere, professional chef Jay Teo, 33, recounts the highs and lows of his culinary journey, which began at the age of 16. From winning a tapas competition in Spain and a Michelin star in Singapore, to launching a failed pop-up restaurant, one must love both the good and bad to thrive in the Food & Beverage business, he writes.\nI studied electronic and computer engineering at Nanyang Polytechnic. During that period, I was a part-time cook at Fish & Co.\nMy parents were not keen on me joining the Food & Beverage (F&B) industry as they saw how tiring it was, but I enjoyed the camaraderie in the kitchen and wanted to try out the job.\nI graduated in 2011 and after National Service enrolled in a Workforce Skills Qualifications diploma in food services (culinary arts) at Shatec.\nMy mum encouraged me, despite knowing it would be tough — she knew how stubborn I was!\nIn 2015, near the end of my course, I applied for the 8th Spanish Gastronomy Training Programme offered by the Spanish government.\nI got selected and was off to Valladolid, northwest Spain, for six months after graduating.\nWe spent the first three months studying the Spanish language and cuisine. We were also attached to Tapas restaurants and worked there after school, including our off days.\nI was placed at a tapas bar called Villa Paramesa Tapas.\nIt was challenging working from 6pm until closing. Sometimes we ended at 2am, but serving 200-300 people a night was satisfying, especially with just four in the kitchen.\nThe next three months, I interned at one-star Michelin restaurant La Botica de Matapozuelos, near Valladolid. \nWe would pick herbs from the back garden. Sometimes we foraged for berries or visited the farm at our chef’s home to catch chickens and harvest vegetables. \nIt was a chef’s dream come true.\nWe ended the stint with a competition to create a tapa dish, and I won. For the first time, I felt I was good at something. \nI returned to Singapore fully intending to work in Spain. \nShortly after, chef Rishi Naleendra, who started Cheek by Jowl restaurant at Boon Tat Street, invited me for an interview. I had always wanted to visit him as he, too, had interned at La Botica.\nI joined his restaurant in 2016 while waiting for an opening in Spain. That year, the famed Michelin guide launched in Singapore.\nChef Rishi asked if I could stay and help the restaurant achieve a star, and I agreed. We managed to do that in 2017. It is still one of my proudest moments.\nWe kept the star for three years. During that time, I rose from commis chef to head chef in 2018.\nIn 2019, we rebranded as Cheek Bistro and I stayed until end-2020 — the year Covid-19 hit.\nI had gotten engaged that year and wanted a change. Shatec had offered me a training instructor role and my fiancee and I agreed that I should accept it. We got married the year after.\nAs an instructor, I truly enjoyed spending time with my students, but I still longed for the kitchen.\nSo, I sold homemade char siew tarts, cookies and fish stuffed with laksa paste on my off days.\nI also created my own brand, FullCircle by J.man — a nickname Chef Rishi gave me. I found a business partner and left Shatec to set up FullCircle as a pop-up restaurant at Thye Hong Centre on Leng Kee Road. It operated from August 2022 to August 2023.\nI was happy to showcase my own cooking style. But there were challenges — from staff shortages to poor sales because of our location. After a year, the partnership ended. I took a break to refresh myself mentally.\nWhat I’ve learned from this experience is that it’s okay to fail and know when to stop. It was not an easy pill to swallow, but a necessary one.\nThings are looking up. In November, I entered another tapas competition in Spain and placed fifth out of 16 international contestants.\nIn future, I plan on opening a Singapore-style tapas restaurant.\nMy parents are proud of my achievements, and they tell their friends about me. My wife has grown to understand and support my work. She’s the backbone of our family, taking care of our two-year-old boy on top of her job as a teacher.\nI believe that to thrive in the F&B industry you must love both the good and bad. If you realise you only love cooking, then keep it as a hobby.\n \nABOUT THE WRITER:\nJay Teo Junxiang, 33, is the owner of pop-up Asian cuisine brand FullCircle by J.man, which is currently on a hiatus, but has a pop-up event planned at the Arts House from Dec 21-23. He has worked in kitchens since the age of 16 and has been a professional chef for eight years. "

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "The issue of car ownership amid skyrocketing Certificate of Entitlement (COE) premiums was hotly debated by TODAY readers this week. In TODAY’s Big Read series last weekend, car dealers, owners and industry observers shared their views on why people still buy cars in Singapore, and how the market has responded to help consumers. \nReaders were divided over the issue, with many saying that families with young children or the elderly should be entitled to own a car. Others disagreed, saying that Singapore’s public transport system was sufficient, while some suggested changes to the COE system to bring down prices. Here's a selection of comments:\nCOEs should be allocated based on need, not affordability. Families with children or (the) elderly should be entitled to own one family sedan (not a luxurious continental car) without the need to pay for COE. A basic car for a family should be treated like a HDB flat. The current formula based solely on affordability is twisted — those who are well-off can own multiple cars… even though such individuals don't need it; or those using the car for business, such as private hires. HO YEW CHIN\nIf you're out without your kids and it starts raining, you'll find it hard to get a cab or PHV (private hire vehicle). Now if you have one kid with you, your pool of options lessens because you either have to call a standard cab or the PHV family version. If you have more than one kid with you, getting a family PHV with multiple child seats is challenging and your pool of options drastically reduces. Of course, you can always take public transport, which comes with its own set of challenges depending how old your kids are. JAN TAN\nSometimes, we families with small kids would love to travel via public transport, but our fellow commuters are something else. Lifts meant for the elderly and prams are all filled up with abled(-bodied) people who don’t bat an eyelid to those in need. On buses, people stand at the area where prams are supposed to be parked… Our transport system is excellent. It’s the users who are lacking EQ and IQ. NOURA YUSOFF\nI’ve got a 76-year-old mum and 93-year-old grandma. Every Sunday I take them out for dinner which (makes them) very happy. I occasionally take them to the supermarket to buy groceries. That’s how important owning a car is. The Government should make it affordable for all families to own their first car. Those who buy a second car should be made to pay higher. GOH KHENG LENG\nI die die won't buy a car because our transport system is good. Point to point, no need to fight or wait for parking, kena (get) summon, (pay) road tax, insurance… and season parking. Taxi, Grab and others, reach destination, open door (and) walk, which is so convenient. ROY TANG\nMy parents and their parents, together with my uncles and aunties’ generations, did not have a car when they were bringing up their families. It can be done, in fact brings you much closer to your children than being a driver. CALVIN YO\nTimes have changed. Do not live the way our fathers have lived on this land. This is now a modern city, live like a city dweller. If you insist on owning a car in a city, it is an extravagance you must be prepared to pay for. Weekend rental or car-pooling is another alternative over public transport. TAN FAITH\nIn Singapore, driving or riding is actually not considered a \"leisure ride\" since our country is small. So many traffic lights too… even if you pay for ERP (Electronic Road Pricing), you can still be stuck in a traffic jam. YUJIN TAN\nUltimately, we must recognise that a car is still a luxury rather than a necessity (even for those who really need it), regardless of which angle you look at it, and that affordability is not something we can solve for. CHENG FEI\nThe answer lies in the satellite-based ERP system, which is long overdue… When the new ERP system can control the usage of roads at an optimum level…  it could result in the Government being able to release more COEs for each monthly bidding. Car ownership does not cause traffic congestion. It is the use of cars on the roads at the same time that causes traffic jams. TAN KOK TIM\nSeparate the COE for families and (those) that need a car to make a living. Those who own more than one family car (should be) considered a luxury COE. PETER LEE\nA Catch-22 situation. A better public transport system needs higher ridership to be cost effective. Higher ridership means more crowding, more inconvenience, especially during peak hours… More taxis, more PHVs, higher COEs, higher fares, more traffic, more congestion, more unproductive. Higher COEs also push up other transport costs. There must be a balance. The system needs an overhaul. If our infrastructure cannot support the bulging population growth, slow it down.

            "Article Body": "The fast-changing nature of work has prompted many Singaporeans to upgrade their skills to stay relevant. TODAY’s Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young Singaporeans who have recently done so to give their careers a boost, or even pursue new paths in life.\nIn this instalment, Ms Chang Xue Qi, 28, describes the challenges of being the youngest supervisor at a senior daycare centre — especially when dealing with staff. On top of picking up people management skills on the job, Ms Chang is also pursuing a master’s degree in applied gerontology to better serve her elderly clients.\n \nMy career in the eldercare sector began in February 2018, when I volunteered with the Silver Generation Office (SGO), the outreach arm of the Agency for Integrated Care. \nMy grandmother sparked my interest in caring for the elderly. She was an instrumental figure in my growing-up years, having left her job as a factory worker to look after me when I was born. Through her, I learnt values such as empathy and compassion.\nI graduated from the National University of Singapore (NUS) in 2018, with an honours degree in political science. Inspired by my grandmother, my honours thesis was about improving the effectiveness of policy communications to the elderly.\nI joined SGO full-time in July 2018. There, I actively reached out to seniors and their caregivers to assist them with various government schemes and policies.\nThat sparked my interest to learn more about ageing issues, so I took up a part-time specialist diploma in gerontology at Temasek Polytechnic in October 2020.\nIt was difficult juggling work and study commitments. Blessed with supportive family members, lecturers, classmates and colleagues, I managed to graduate in May 2022 and was the valedictorian for my cohort. It is one of the proudest moments in my working life.\nBefore graduating, I was offered the opportunity to manage the All Saints Home in Yishun, which is a nursing home that also provides day care and other services for seniors, but I was unsure if I could be a good supervisor.\nHowever, my current boss encouraged me to try interviewing for the job. To my delight, I was accepted and started work in March 2022.\nI was, and still am, the youngest supervisor in my organisation.\nManaging a daycare centre is an uphill task. I could communicate well with seniors, but it is a different ball game with staff. I had to learn people management and communication skills on the job.\nFor example, when I receive complaints about staff behaviour, I need to tactfully speak to those concerned about it. Many of them are senior staff who are much older than me.\nI often spend time thinking about the right words and body language to convey my message, so that I can strike a balance between correcting misbehaviour and keeping staff motivated.\nAll this happened as I was starting my part-time master’s degree in applied gerontology at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in August 2022.\nI felt that this programme was a natural progression from my diploma, as it could equip me with skills and knowledge to better serve the elderly. If all goes well, I should graduate in July 2024.\nMy family is my pillar of support; they unconditionally allowed me to pursue my aspirations and even offered to fund my studies. They did not have to do so, as I later secured a full tuition scholarship from Ngee Ann Kongsi, which I’m deeply grateful for.\nJuggling my new job and the master’s is definitely challenging. I have to sacrifice my weekends to study. On weekday nights after work, I rush to NTU for my classes — a nerve-racking journey due to traffic.\nNevertheless, I enjoy my classes. My favourite module so far is leadership and management in aged care, where I learnt about strategic management and various personality types. I now understand why people behave in certain ways, and how I can fine-tune my communications with them.\nIt is both rewarding and challenging managing a team of 14 staff, with vastly different ages and backgrounds.\nWorking in an elderly-dominated environment has also trained me to be mature and tactful in handling difficult situations.\nBeing a supervisor, I’ve learnt to be less task-oriented, and instead focus on engaging staff and caring about their well-being. This was a paradigm shift from my previous SGO job, but surely and slowly, I am learning to empathise with my staff more.\nMy boss once said he wanted to pay it forward by mentoring me, because he benefited from his own experience. I aspire to do the same too.\nMy advice to people embarking on a similar journey?\nThere is no fixed age to being a leader or supervisor. With the right mentorship and a positive learning attitude, you can make it. \n\nABOUT THE WRITER:\nMs Chang Xue Qi, 28, is a centre supervisor at All Saints Home. She is pursuing her master’s degree in applied gerontology at Nanyang Technological University. The only child of her family, she lives with her grandmother, who first sparked her interest to serve the elderly.

            "Article Body": "My innate love for animals from young and the desire to help them had led me to turning it into a veterinary career. Today, however, I speak the language of programming in the technology industry.\nThe change, drastic as it may sounds, wasn’t made out of necessity. Rather, it stemmed from a self-reflecting period where I chose to push myself beyond passion to explore other career options.\nI graduated with a Diploma in Veterinary Bioscience from Ngee Ann Polytechnic in 2016 and worked as a veterinary technician at an animal clinic for two years from 2019 to 2020 after completing my national service.\nMany things were uncertain at that time due to the Covid-19 pandemic. People were losing their jobs and workers being forced to change career paths.\nThrough these, I saw the importance of continuous learning to obtain new knowledge and skills throughout our careers, especially in times of crisis.\nThe pandemic might have had many businesses on the ropes, but it also inspired innovation and was a game-changer for the start-up ecosystem. I was motivated by the sector’s vibrancy and wanted to be a part of it.\nWhile it was difficult to give up what I had studied to pursue new pastures, I found that I could still fuel my passion for animals through volunteer work at animal shelters.\nI joined an online automotive marketplace in January 2021 to experience life in a start-up environment where people wear multiple hats. I picked up different skillsets and worked in cross-functional teams which exposed me to tech development.\nIn July 2022, I enrolled in a part-time Bachelor in Information and Communications Technology at the Singapore University of Social Sciences to boost my knowledge of new technologies that connect the physical and digital worlds.\nAt the same time, I was looking out for jobs that could complement my studies.\nThat took me to Workforce Singapore’s Career Conversion Programme for Tech Professionals, specifically Red Alpha Cybersecurity's specialist training programme which provides classroom and on-the-job training for those who did not have relevant experience in cybersecurity, a lynchpin of the digital world.\nI left my previous workplace in March this year and joined Red Alpha in April as an Associate Cybersecurity Specialist to pick up new skills in areas such as penetration testing and network forensics.\nI am currently in the training phases of the programme and attending courses on hacker tools, techniques, incident handling as well as penetration testing, which is a simulated cyber attack to check for exploitable vulnerabilities, so that I can obtain relevant certifications and the requisite skillsets to be a practitioner in the industry.\nAt the same time, I am able to tap a strong network of cybersecurity practitioners made up of instructors, industry mentors and Red Alpha alumni, and that has helped to accelerate my learning and made the transition more manageable.\nWorking in a start-up previously required creative problem solving and active communications, and I found that these soft skills were also applicable in the cybersecurity field.\nSwitching from a career path fueled by the passion I had since young to one that was shaped by a more pragmatic approach wasn’t easy. It was a heavy decision to make as I had to commit both money and time to it.\nThe learning curve has been steep especially since I have to learn an entirely new set of skills, but I know that I have to work extra hard to be successful.\nTechnologies are ever-changing, and thus those who excel are people who can adapt and learn as they progress in their careers.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER:\nElroy Xu Minjie, 27, is an animal lover who wanted a career aligned with his passion. Today, he is pursuing a brand new career path in cybersecurity through Workforce Singapore’s Career Conversion Programme."

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "I wonder whether anyone would seriously argue that requiring helmets or safety harnesses for construction workers would be undesirable because of “real, practical and operational complexities”. \nOf course there are complexities and costs, but we as a society tackle these complexities and incur these costs because human safety is at stake. \nRespect for safety and human life is part of our social compact.\nTherefore, the alleged “complexities” of arranging bus transport for workers, instead of having them ride in lorries, would not involve a “change in the social compact”, as various businesses have claimed.\nFar from it — it would advance the values that Singaporeans hold dear.\nOne might argue that costs may increase (although I have seen no attempt to quantify these costs concretely). \nBut other safety measures — protective equipment, safety protocols, and limits on working hours also cost money.\nThe question, then, is whether taking more steps to secure the safety of workers, to the equal extent that we secure the safety of other road users, is worth the money. \nI say it is.\nAnd if the costs of prohibiting lorry transport are intangible, I ask: What about the intangible costs of allowing it? \nWould workers who are made to ride in lorries lose morale, resulting in a diminished question of work? \nPerhaps this argument is speculative. But it is no less speculative than the claims by the business groups that banning lorry transport will cause traffic jams.\nThere is also an issue of consistency in policy. If riding in the back of a lorry is safe, why should workers be the only ones carried in lorries?\nIf lorries are deemed safe enough, why not allow large families or groups of friends to get around in lorries instead of multiple cars? \nWhy not allow minibus operators to provide lorry transport for the public, or have a lorry service to carry groups of tourists on tours? \nWhy not replace school buses with lorries (which can probably hold more children)? These, too, may well be cheaper for everyone.\nBut if lorry transport is deemed not safe enough for the public generally — even if it is cheaper — then why should we consider it safe enough for some workers?

            "Article Body": "The fast-changing nature of work has prompted many Singaporeans to upgrade their skills to stay relevant. TODAY’s Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of Singaporeans who have recently done so to give their careers a boost, or even pursue new paths in life.\nIn this instalment, Mr Mohammed Faiz Junaidi, 38, recounts his academic journey from the Institute of Technical Education to completing his master's degree as an adult. Despite his early struggles, he discovered his passion for his career as a safety professional and upgraded his skills over the years to retain his competitive edge.\n\nI completed my Master of Science in Health and Safety at the Management Development Institute of Singapore (MDIS) in March. \nThis was just a year after getting my Bachelor of Science in Safety, Health and Environmental Management, also at MDIS, at the age of 37.\nLooking back at my 16 years as a safety professional, I would not have imagined achieving this when I was younger. \nAs a child, I had a mischievous nature and found it difficult to sit still. \nStaying focused was a challenge, as images of toys and cartoons continuously flashed through my head. As I got older, my mind would often wander to football. \nDuring that period, conversations on mental conditions such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder were scarce, and I did not seek medical attention or get a diagnosis.\nLuckily, my academic performance was unaffected. I finished primary school in 1997 and subsequently passed my GCE N-Levels. \nWith my parents’ encouragement, I completed a Nitec in Automotive Technology (Light Vehicles) at the Institute of Technical Education Ang Mo Kio.\nIn 2007, I began working as a technician at ComfortDelGro’s taxi service centre after my National Service. \nHowever, my time in the automotive industry was short-lived. A few months later, I was offered a position as a trainee safety advisor in the oil and gas industry. This marked the beginning of my career in Health, Safety and the Environment (HSE).\nI was motivated to advance in this career as I saw how safety lapses led to injuries, and how machinery became faulty in the hands of untrained workers. \nI also enjoyed communicating with workers and their management on how to prevent injuries and unnecessary breakdowns. \nI obtained a specialist diploma in workplace safety and health at the BCA Academy in 2011. \nThis allowed me to become a registered safety officer recognised by the Ministry of Manpower. \nDuring that period, balancing my work with part-time studies was still manageable because I was still single. \nI was then a safety coordinator in the oil and gas sector and planned my night classes around my shifts. \nIn the following years, I observed changes in the industry, such as more foreigners getting registered as safety officers. Most job postings also required safety officers to have degrees. \nThus, in 2019, I enrolled in my degree programme at MDIS. \nI chose MDIS for its attractive fees and because its degree is IOSH-accredited. \nIOSH, or the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health, is a global organisation for health and safety professionals. I felt that such accreditation would give me an edge over similar degrees from other institutions. \nCompared to my previous studies in 2011, I had to care for my two children, then aged one and four, and support my wife. \nI was then a HSE advisor for an integrated facility management company working normal office hours. \nWhen I returned to school, I was excited and nervous. \nThe lecturers were very accommodating to our work commitments. They shared their contact details with us so we could reach them if we had questions. \nA big challenge that I faced when attending school was that I had less time to play with my children. When I got home after class, they would be sleeping, and would still be asleep the next morning when I left for work. \nNevertheless, with my family’s unwavering support, I excelled in my bachelor's programme and graduated with first-class honours. \nI was eager to continue my professional growth and started my master’s course exactly a year later. \nIt was an easy decision to carry on at MDIS, thanks to the lecturers who assisted us.\nFurthering my studies was a dream which I thought was unachievable since I was from the ITE stream.\nThrough my academic journey, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of the HSE field, including best practices in risk management, occupational safety, and environmental sustainability. \nI have also honed my analytical skills, enabling my ability to identify potential hazards and develop effective strategies to mitigate them. \nAs I reflect on my journey thus far, I am grateful for the opportunities that have shaped me into what I am today. \nABOUT THE WRITER:\nMr Mohammed Faiz Junaidi, 38, is a corporate safety manager for a local construction company. He has worked as a safety professional for various industries such as oil and gas, aviation, and facilities management.\n\nIf you have an experience to share or know someone who wishes to contribute to this series, write to voices@mediacorp.com.sg with your full name, address and phone number."

TODAY’s Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of Singaporeans who have recently done so to give their careers a boost, or even pursue new paths in life.\nIn this instalment, Mr Toh Hong Giep, 51, recounts his learning journey over the years to become a more “T-shaped” person, with broad knowledge across different disciplines and deep expertise in a few specific areas. Mr Toh, an IT professional, is now pursuing his second master’s degree in business analytics. Despite having a different approach to learning than his younger coursemates, it is important to embrace new technologies to stay relevant, he says.\n\n\nIn today's rapidly changing world, continuous learning is not just a nice-to-have — it is a necessity. \nAs an IT professional with more than 20 years of experience working in multiple countries, I understand the importance of keeping up with the latest technologies and business practices.\nI am currently an IT director with a government agency. \nMy responsibilities include overseeing projects to ensure that they receive timely support and actively engaging stakeholders to stay in tune with their business needs. Equally important, I will roll up my sleeves and work alongside my team to fix technical issues. \nOne concept that has been particularly useful in my career is the idea of being a “T-shaped” person through lifelong learning. This means having broad knowledge and skills across different disciplines (the top of the T) and deep expertise in one or a few specific areas (the vertical line of the T). \nFor example, to enhance my understanding of the business world beyond the technology lens, I pursued the Tsinghua-Insead Executive MBA programme (EMBA) in 2007. \nThis was 10 years after I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Systems & Information Science from the National University of Singapore (NUS) in 1997.\nThe EMBA was an 18-month programme, anchored in Singapore and Beijing, with lessons in Fontainebleau, France and Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. \nIt provided me with a broader perspective on business, ranging from strategy and marketing to finance and operations. I also got to interact with professionals from different industries, which gave me a fresh perspective on various business challenges. \nThe course opened my eyes to the myriad and complex decisions often faced by senior management. This allowed me to better approach issues from their perspective and build closer partnerships.\nMy passion for learning did not stop after my EMBA. \nIn 2021, at the age of 49, I enrolled in the NUS Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) programme and will graduate this year.  \nI’ve always enjoyed studying computer science and this programme was a great opportunity to get a deep technical understanding of the various techniques and tools used in data analytics. It covers topics like fraud analysis, propensity analysis and recommendation engines which businesses use to predict what customers will like.\nLifelong learning is not without its challenges. \nAs a working professional, finding time to learn can be hard. It is difficult to balance work, family, and personal commitments. Luckily, my wife and two teenage children are very supportive. \nTo strike a balance between family and study, I usually set aside weekend afternoons or evenings for family activities while leaving the rest for my coursework.\nEven with family support, staying motivated and focused can be daunting.\nTo overcome this, I break my coursework down into manageable tasks and proactively seek support from faculty members and fellow classmates. \nInteracting with classmates from the younger generation, especially millennials, I see that they have a different approach to learning. \nThey are more digitally savvy and prefer interactive and engaging methods such as gamification and micro-learning. \nWhile this may not appeal to everyone, it is important to embrace new technologies and learning models to stay relevant in the digital age. \nFor example, I learned to go back to lecture recordings or use online resources to clarify any unclear points. This works well for me as I can schedule my learning to fit pockets of free time.\nBeing a T-shaped person has made me more versatile, adaptable, and valuable to employers. It has allowed me to collaborate across different fields and apply knowledge from various areas to solve problems.\nDespite the challenges, lifelong learning has been fulfilling and rewarding, and has allowed me to grow personally and professionally. \nAs the car magnate Henry Ford once said, \"Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at 20 or 80. Anyone who keeps learning stays young.\"\n\nABOUT THE WRITER:\nMr Toh Hong Giep, 51, is an IT director with a government agency.

TODAY’s Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young Singaporeans who have recently done so to give their careers a boost, or even pursue new paths in life.\nIn this instalment, Ms Mardhiah Ahmad, 32, describes how she moved from construction to a more challenging role in rail operations through a career conversion programme. Ms Mardhiah, who started her career as a crane operator, says she’s putting her prior work experience to good use as an assistant station manager at SMRT.  \n\n \nI’ve always believed in the importance of continuous learning. After all, we live in a world that is constantly evolving, and if we don’t keep up, we risk being left behind. \nI am an assistant station manager at SMRT Corporation, supporting the day-to-day operations at the Gardens by the Bay station. \nBefore this, I was a crane operator from 2012 to 2018, and a safety coordinator from 2020 to 2022 at a construction site. \nI graduated from ITE College East in 2010 with a certificate in audio and video production, and completed an advanced certificate in workplace safety and health, which was relevant to my previous jobs, at NTUC LearningHub in 2020. \nI wanted a more challenging role that would give me better opportunities for career growth. \nIn March 2021, I came across Workforce Singapore’s Career Conversion Programme (CCP) for Rail Operations Professionals. \nIt is a place-and-train programme offered by SMRT for mid-career individuals keen on joining the rail industry. \nIt has classroom lessons covering topics such as first aid and train service operations. \nAfter about five months, trainees go on to become assistant station managers or station managers with SMRT.\nI was convinced this programme was what I was looking for as it would allow me to venture into a new sector but still put my prior experience to good use. \nWhat attracted me most about joining rail operations was the opportunity to operate trains and to learn more about them. As someone who enjoys hands-on work, I was keen to explore the ins and outs of train stations and services. \nI was employed by SMRT and accepted into the programme in January 2022. \nInitially, it was difficult for me to catch up with the training, as it had been a while since I had left school. \nHowever, I was thankful to be able to grasp the different concepts and skills and relate them to my experience as a crane operator. \nFor example, having a good understanding of how to operate and maintain machines and tools, and being able to remain calm in stressful situations, are relevant in rail operations. \nI was confident that this would help me to step into the new role successfully.\nThe five-month training helped me better adapt into my role as an assistant station manager. It was a big change from my previous job, but I was excited to take on this new challenge. \nMy responsibilities now include conducting security patrols, providing customer service, and performing duties in the passenger service centre. \nI also act as an emergency train operator when required and provide support during rail incidents and emergencies. \nAlthough my previous construction role had its fair share of leadership opportunities, there were limitations to how much I could contribute, which impeded my ability to showcase my potential as a leader. \nI feel that I am much more challenged in my current role as it allows me to put the skills I have learned to use on a daily basis. \nAdjusting to a new work environment can be difficult, but I knew that having the right attitude and beliefs, such as wanting to serve from the heart and always putting commuters first, play a huge part in this industry. \nThankfully, with the support of my colleagues and trainers, I was able to cope with the challenges, juggling work responsibilities with family commitments. Not only have I built good rapport with my colleagues, I also feel more valued at work. \nBoth my mother and grandmother are happy with my career switch, too, as they feel that the new role promises better stability and allows room for me to grow and learn. \nAfter attending in-house and external training, I hope to take on bigger roles in future, such as becoming a senior assistant station manager or station manager. \nThrough this experience, I’ve learnt that embracing new opportunities can be incredibly rewarding, even if it means getting out of your comfort zone. \nI’ve gained new skills, made new connections, and have a greater sense of fulfilment in my work. More importantly, I’ve also learnt it’s never too late to start learning something new. \n\nABOUT THE WRITER: \nMs Mardhiah Ahmad, 32, formerly worked in construction and successfully switched to being an assistant station manager at SMRT with the help of Workforce Singapore's Career Conversion Programme.\nIf you have an experience to share or know someone who wishes to contribute to this series, write to voices@mediacorp.com.sg with your full name, address and phone number."

            "Article Body": "To children, the fear of witnessing violence between their parents — the very same people who are supposed to care and protect them — is paralysing and unexplainable.\nThe co-occurrence of child abuse and spousal violence has been widely documented. \nIn the past financial year, 66 per cent of our own cases involved children who were both abused and witnessed violence between their parents. This has been consistent in the past couple of years.\nThe impact of family violence on children can be detrimental and long-lasting.\nThis is why the changes to the Women’s Charter, passed in Parliament on Tuesday (July 4), make sense.\nThe new laws empower the authorities to issue emergency orders to stop perpetrators at the scene of high-risk cases of family violence.\nSuch directives — which include stay away and no contact orders — send out a strong signal that violence in any form in a familial relationship is not condoned in Singapore.\nThe laws also emphasise that families are important and that every member requires help. This includes children, adult survivors and perpetrators. \nCounselling has always been offered to all parties. What is different now is that should someone refuse help, it is now compulsory for them to comply. \nMandatory treatment, especially for those with psychiatric conditions, opens the doors for social services to offer families the help they need.\nWhile most people adhere to the law, there is a small group who default on the services offered to them by the court. They defy orders such as the domestic exclusion order and continue to harm members of the family. \nUnder the amendments, the message is clear that if offenders choose to breach any order, they face increased penalties, such as electronic tagging and arrest.  \nThe amendments also put the welfare of survivors at the forefront. \nWhen a survivor’s life is in danger or her judgement impaired because of trauma, emergency orders enable her to be removed to a safe place, allowing her to make decisions in an environment away from home and with professional support.\nI believe that the new laws are fundamental changes which will open doors for social services to move in early and provide the support necessary for the whole family, especially those who cause harm. \nThis also sends a message to children who experience violence at home that there are adults who care enough to take another look at the law and change it, so families like theirs can heal.\nHave views on this issue or a news topic you care about?

TODAY’s Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young Singaporeans who have recently done so to give their careers a boost, or even pursue new paths in life.\nIn this instalment, Mr Hendra Roy Osland, 31, recounts his career move from tourism to nursing. The road was not easy, especially as his son was born just before his career conversion programme at NUS Nursing started. His mother, who had been a nurse herself, died of cancer months later.\n\nSwitching careers can be daunting, but for me, nursing is a calling.\nMy late mother was, and still is, my biggest inspiration to pursue nursing. She was a nurse herself before I was born.\nI had joined the tourism industry after graduating with a diploma in Pharmaceutical Sciences from Republic Polytechnic in 2013 as I enjoyed meeting and serving people in a hospitality setting.\nBut despite spending almost a decade in multiple roles from branding to guest services, I could never shake off the feeling that there had to be more in life.\nIn 2019, while I was the duty executive at Gardens by the Bay, I helped to resuscitate a guest who had collapsed. The experience sparked a desire to return to the healthcare industry — this time as a nurse.\nA friend in my reservist unit introduced me to the Career Conversion Programme offered by Workforce Singapore and the Alice Lee Centre for Nursing Studies at the National University of Singapore (NUS Nursing).\nAfter an intense interview process, I was thrilled to receive news that the National University Hospital had agreed to sponsor me for the programme in mid-2020.\nThis meant that my fees would be fully paid for, and I would get a monthly allowance during the two-year course, followed by a completion bonus. The conditions were that I meet the grade requirements and serve a three-year bond after graduation.\nI began in August 2020. We studied a wide range of topics from anatomy, physiology, mental health, to leadership and management.\nIt took me a while to get re-accustomed to scientific modules such as anatomy and pharmacology as it had been nearly a decade since my diploma.\nI also had a difficult time juggling work, study, and family — especially as my son was born a month before the programme started.\nPlus, as I was in a fast-track course for mid-career professionals, we had clinical practice during our term breaks as well.\nDedicating time for rest and family was crucial to prevent burnout.\nI would have back-to-back afternoon and morning shifts, which meant I would only see my son in the morning before the afternoon shift and again the next day after my morning shift.\nIn June 2021, while I was in the thick of my course. I received the call that my mum had died just as I was starting my shift at 7am.\nShe had fought a six-year battle with breast cancer which had spread to other organs.\nI graduated in July 2022 and started work as a full-fledged nurse.\nIn hospitality, I managed hundreds of guests per day but my interactions with them typically lasted only a few minutes each and involved addressing their entertainment needs.\nIn nursing, I journey with most of my patients from admission to discharge, getting to care for them and their family holistically. The decisions I make as a nurse can be lifesaving.\nThere are days now when I work double shifts and am separated from my son for more than 24 hours.\nDuring these shifts, I feel blessed to still be able to connect with home via a video call.\nThe strong support from my loved ones helped me cope with the stress of a mid-career switch.\nMy advice to anyone considering a career switch to nursing is to research the profession thoroughly. Talk to practising nurses and lecturers who can share their experiences.\nThere are indeed some stereotypical gender misconceptions about nursing being a female role.\nFor example, some older patients address nurses as “Missy”. For ease of communication, I tell them to call me “Missy” too when they need to get my attention.\nThis is rare, however, and it is comforting to see that people hardly bat an eyelid when they see a male nurse.\nIn fact, certain disciplines such as orthopaedic surgery, where I am in, welcome male nurses as they require people who can handle the physical demands of the role.\nNursing may not be an easy job, but it is a fulfilling career that offers many opportunities beyond traditional clinical or management routes.\nYou will be deeply involved in some of your patients’ most vulnerable moments, and contribute to making a difference in their lives.\n\nABOUT THE WRITER:\nMr Hendra Roy Osland, 31, is a staff nurse in an orthopaedic surgery ward at the National University Hospital in Singapore.

Mr Kang is pursuing a Sport Science degree in hopes of helping other athletes perform better.\n\n \nI am pursuing a degree in Sport Science with Edinburgh Napier University via PSB Academy. \nMy goal is to become a sport psychologist, helping athletes ease their nerves especially when they do not perform up to expectations.\nI chose this course to deepen my knowledge of the science aspect of sport, for example, by learning ways to help athletes cope in high-pressure situations. \nBeing a full-time student brings to mind the sacrifices I made during my days as a national taekwondo athlete. \nTaekwondo has been a huge part of my life since I first donned my uniform some 20 years ago. \nI won a gold and bronze medal in the poomsae event at the 28th Southeast Asian Games in 2015.\nIn 2018, I began working as an operations executive at Evolve MMA, a mixed martial arts gym, after completing my National Service. \nI later became an operations manager there and found myself needing to step out of my comfort zone to lead a team. \nIn 2021, I had the opportunity to return to taekwondo in a different capacity. \nI joined the Singapore Taekwondo Federation as an operations manager to oversee the nuts and bolts of the national governing body for the sport. \nI was quickly involved in many committees, including the High Performance Committee which was made up of ex-national athletes and technical experts. \nMy role in that committee was to assist in organising open selections to recruit new athletes and closed selections to select athletes going for competitions. I also liaised with our Korean coaches to put their plans on paper, and acted as a translator. \nThroughout my two years there, I had the privilege to see through policies and a series of projects to enhance the development of our athletes. \nThese included coming up with selection policies and criteria for our national team and a code of conduct for athletes.\nIt was inspiring to have been involved in redefining the career pathway for athletes and coming up with strategies to improve their performance. \nThis sparked my desire to equip myself with knowledge and skills to better contribute to the sporting industry. \nI left the federation in August 2022 to pursue my Sport Science degree. It will take me one year and four months to complete the programme. \nBalancing social life, family time, and many other factors was something that I had to learn to manage from the start. \nI remember back in my polytechnic days, which were packed with training and overseas competitions, it was really challenging to juggle school and taekwondo. \nAfter evening training, my mum made sure that I had dinner before I took off to revise or finish school assignments. \nThe challenge for me now is juggling between part-time coaching to finance my degree, and focusing on studying. \nBeing a newlywed, I also needed a strong support system at home because I had to make the difficult decision to leave my full-time job for my studies. \nFor this, I am grateful for my wife's unwavering and wholehearted support. \nMy experience as an athlete has taught me to cope with challenges by reframing negatives into positives. I’ve learnt to see each challenge I face as a learning opportunity.\nI am also blessed with very supportive parents who have always been there for me throughout my athletic — and now academic — journey. \nFor parents reading this article, your support to your child is of the utmost importance to them as you are the first person they see before they leave home and when they get back. \nSometimes a small act of encouragement leaves a large impact and provides the very boost they need after an arduous day. \nTo all athletes, when a goal or event seems too big, break it down into smaller goals and start by achieving them while gaining confidence to tackle the bigger ones.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nMr Kang Rui Jie, 28, is a full-time Sport Science degree student at PSB Academy in Singapore.

I worked in sales and marketing for a few years and took on a few temporary jobs before joining the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) as an assistant management executive in 2017. \nMy duties included providing various services such as school and nursing home identity card (IC) registration. \nI later became a leader of the IC unit correspondences team, which answers enquiries from the public regarding IC matters. \nLittle did I know my career path would lead me to fulfil my long-held aspiration of furthering my studies.\nA casual conversation with my senior officers in 2020 presented me with the possibility of applying for the Ministry of Home Affairs’ (MHA) full-time degree scholarship. \nApplicants were required to possess strong leadership qualities and serve a four-year bond after graduation. With my bosses’ encouragement, I took a shot, and to my delight, I secured the scholarship in 2021.\nExcited and optimistic, I enrolled that same year as a Sociology major at the National University of Singapore (NUS) through the adult-learner admissions pathway, Advance@NUS, which took into account my work experience.\nWhy sociology? As a civil servant, I have had the privilege of meeting people from all walks of life and wanted to improve the quality of services provided to them. \nI remember once receiving a call from an elderly woman who was struggling to renew her IC online. While spending close to an hour guiding her on the process, I realised that some individuals may still face difficulties in accessing our services and are unable to obtain help from others due to social isolation. \nThat experience sparked an interest in me to better understand the people I serve, and I believe that studying sociology could empower me with deeper insights into our society. \nMy time at NUS has been nothing short of eye-opening. \nModules like gender studies have broadened my perspective on gender identity complexities, giving me the tools to support those who identify differently from the gender binary with sensitivity and offer appropriate aid, for example, in their applications for identification documents. \nMeanwhile, modules on ageing have provided me insights into the challenges faced by seniors, allowing me to be more empathetic and to be able to suggest improvements to our services when I return to work.\nBeyond soft skills, the programme has also equipped me with technical know-how in data science. I was taught to use Microsoft Excel and statistical software to analyse large and complex datasets. \nIn one of my group projects, we performed qualitative and quantitative research to understand the phenomenon of underage drinking in Singapore. We interpreted the data and findings using sociological concepts such as functionalism, which explores the functions that different aspects of society play. \nThese skills are transferable to decision-making in areas like data collection and analysis, which is crucial for tasks such as reviewing application processes.\nOf course, pursuing further studies is not without its challenges, as it requires a lot of hard work, dedication, and sacrifice. One challenge is to keep up with the academic rigour of coursework at a university level. \nTo overcome this struggle, I put in extra time and effort to read up on the course materials and seek guidance from my professors when necessary. I will also have to sacrifice some leisure time to ensure that I meet the demands of the coursework.\nBut for me, I believe the long-term benefits outweigh the costs. The knowledge and skills that I have gained will undoubtedly continue to shape and guide me in my future endeavours.\nABOUT THE WRITER:\nMs Goh Xin Yi, 28, is a management executive at the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority. As part of her career development, she is now pursuing a four-year bachelor’s degree in Sociology at National University of Singapore’s Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, supported by a Ministry of Home Affairs scholarship.\n\nIf you have an experience to share or know someone who wishes to contribute to this series, write to voices@mediacorp.com.sg with your full name, address and phone number."

            "Article Body": "The fast-changing nature of work has prompted many Singaporeans to upgrade their skills to stay relevant. TODAY’s Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young Singaporeans who have recently done so to give their careers a boost, or even pursue new paths in life.\nIn this instalment, Ms Ether Kum, 32, describes how her desire to better support her clients as a counsellor led her to pursue two part-time master’s degrees in quick succession. While she acknowledges her current Organisational Psychology course is no walk in the park, she believes it will help her understand the challenges working adults face and improve her effectiveness in her role.\n\nI enjoy learning, and in deciding my next steps in education, my premise is that it should improve my effectiveness in my profession — counselling. \nI graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology from the Singapore Institute of Management (SIM) in 2014, and was a youth worker at a home for abused girls from mid-2014 to end-2015.\nThere, I saw how important it was to be equipped with the right skills to understand and support individuals. \nI learned the importance of counselling and left with the intention of furthering my studies in the field. \nI have worked in various counselling roles over the years.\nFrom 2016 to 2021, I was with SIM’s student development team, supporting students through training and counselling.\nThis role taught me about how youths think and helped me relate better to them in the counselling room. \nIn August 2021, I took up a similar role at the Singapore Institute of Technology, which I held until May 2023. \nI started on a new job at a non-profit community service organisation in June. \nAside from counselling, I also work as a part-time admissions coach helping students prepare for entrance tests.\nMy first post-graduate degree was a part-time Master of Counselling at the Singapore University of Social Sciences’ (SUSS), which I completed in March 2021. \nIt was a deeply enriching programme and pursuing it had been a goal of mine since my job at the girls’ home. \nI am now taking my second master’s degree in Organisational Psychology — also at SUSS. \nIt started in January and takes between two and four years to complete, depending on how you spread the modules out. \nOrganisational psychology resonated with me as I have seen how personal challenges impacted my clients at work. \nI believe that the course can help me understand the challenges working adults face. \nEach module comes with its own project, supervised by an industry professional. You could be developing a training programme for an SME (small and medium-sized enterprise) one semester, and working with another on candidate selections the next. \nThe programme is designed to equip candidates with the skills and experience to succeed as an organisational psychologist. \nCase in point — the duration and mode of assignments are always unique, with timelines we would have to meet in the real world.\nYou learn to make efficient decisions, work faster, and be precise in your tasks. Where else do you get to develop these skills, in a safe environment?\nIt's certainly not a walk in the park.\nI feel drained after a long day of work, but I still must attend classes and submit assignments on time. \nI try to manage my time as best as possible, like waking up earlier to get my assignments done. \nI’m grateful that my family and friends have been very understanding of my schedule and my sometimes-random sighs over deadlines. This underscores the importance of a supportive system and like-minded persons who share the same values. \nMy mum taught me to take things in my stride and just give my best in any situation, the best being what you can do in that moment. \nI sometimes ask myself why I signed up for another post-graduate degree. I’d be lying if I said I’m thriving, but I appreciate that it enables me to reflect on my preferences, nurture competencies, and revisit key fundamentals. \nAt my Master of Counselling graduation ceremony in October 2022, Education Minister Chan Chun Sing’s words stuck with me. I had then already applied for my second master’s but was doubtful. \nHe said that we don’t just graduate from an academic milestone, we graduate towards the next one. \nLearning is a journey with infinite milestones. Age or commitments should not define your pursuits.\nOne thing that I have discovered about learning is that it is a fresh breath of air, and an eye-opening experience (if you decide to open your eyes, that is)! \nABOUT THE WRITER: \nMs Ether Kum, 32, is a counsellor and part-time admissions coach. She is also a fitness instructor and freelance food photographer. \nIf you have an experience to share or know someone who wishes to contribute to this series, write to voices@mediacorp.com.sg with your full name, address and phone number."

            "Article Body": "Given how costly it is to undergo driving lessons and tests and how relatively affordable our public transport system, this TODAY journalist had never seriously considered getting a driving licence — but recent events have prompted a change of heart, even if he still doesn’t plan to own a car.\nWhenever the subject of cars comes up in conversations with friends, the same thought always comes to my mind: Is it really necessary to be able to drive in Singapore?\nSingapore is well-known to have an efficient and world-class public transportation system. Having spent my entire life relying on trains and buses to get around, I’ve always wondered why so many people complain about how expensive it is to own a car here, but yet still choose to spend thousands of dollars to earn a driving licence when they may never own a car.\nGiven how costly it is to undergo driving lessons and tests and how relatively affordable our public transport system is, obtaining a driving licence had never really been something I seriously considered.\nHowever, recent events have prompted me to have a change of heart — even if I don’t plan to own a car.\nBelieve it or not, even on a tiny island like Singapore, some places remain relatively inaccessible for public transport users. \nI vividly recall an instance where I had to attend a social gathering event after work at a certain government building at Mount Pleasant. \nAt first glance, the usually reliable Google Maps told me that it was only less than 10 minutes’ walk from the nearest bus stop. \nTo my horror, the walk led me through an unforgiving uphill slog. It seemed never-ending, especially after spending more than eight hours in the office hunched over a desk. \nJust a few minutes into this trek, my laptop that I carried in my bag started to feel like it was made of solid rock. \nBy the time I arrived at my destination, I was drenched in sweat. My thighs were aching for days after. \nMount “Pleasant”? As if.\nHilly mini-route marches aside, even a leisurely visit to some of my favourite downtime destinations these days is still not easy or convenient. \nEast Coast Park is one example, as there are no straightforward ways of getting there using public transport, especially on weekdays.\nSure, you can always get anywhere by hopping into a cab or pulling up a ride-hailing app on your phone. \nBut it’s likely fair to say we all have our own nightmare experiences with surge pricing and difficult drivers who refuse to go the extra mile when asked nicely, or even cancel booked rides for no rhyme or reason. \nCars bearing car-sharing brand logos are becoming more common a sight on our roads as well as in my own neighbourhood.\nEven though I can’t use car-sharing, their prevalence has led me to do my own research into why more Singaporeans are turning to them.\nFlexibility is one key pull factor for me — being able to use the services just for a short trip to a friend’s house at another ulu place or a full day spent running various errands.\nAffordability is another. Since I would not be a regular road user, the overall cost of renting a car, as opposed to owning one, would be more in my favour. I wouldn’t need to bear costs for maintenance, insurance, taxes and so on.\nFinally, there’s convenience. \nMost car-sharing services are accessible through mobile apps — a plus for me, as I already rely upon smartphone apps for most of my daily routine tasks, from setting my alarm, paying for meals and other purchases, to even grocery shopping.\nMuch like any young Singaporean, I love travelling once in a while to get away from the bustling cityscape.\nI’ve been fortunate enough to witness the breathtaking landscapes of Iceland and Arizona in the United States, among other memorable trips.\nOne thing I’ve never been able to do is a road trip, driving for days on open roads through beautiful natural landscapes with incredible sceneries round every corner.\nA destination high up on my road-tripping bucket list would be New Zealand. For me, it's just second to Iceland, which I had been to on an organised tour group that did not feel as satisfying as I'd anticipated.\nI’ll admit: Listening to road trip stories of friends and watching travel videos on social media, the Fomo is starting to set in. \nPerhaps some places are much better off explored on the road by driving, instead of in a tour bus filled with 20 others.\nWhen getting around different places in groups with family and friends, carpooling has been my go-to option most of the time. \nHowever, during Hari Raya visitations this year, I noticed the exhaustion setting in on the faces of the full-day drivers tasked with commuting the same group of people from one house to another — a total of seven destinations over at least five hours. \nWatching them fight off yawn after yawn, I felt a pang of guilt. \nI wondered: “Would it be better if I gave them a break and took over the wheel for a bit?”\nWhile it’s true that situations like these do not occur too often, as I get older, I’m starting to think that it would be nice if I could, once in a while, offer some help with ferrying my relatives around for family events.\nHaving tied the knot not too long ago, images of a possible future with kids in it have started flashing in my head. \nHow would I get a toddler to daycare, and pick him up at the end of the day? Would I want to have my (potentially rowdy) kids running around on a crowded train or bus? \nIf my family were indeed to get bigger, other necessities will also come into play — larger grocery loads, additional furniture, and more. Perhaps in this possible future, the increased practicality and convenience of private modes of transport would be well worth the additional monetary costs.\nAll this considered, it might just be time to step out of my comfort zone at last, and into the driver’s seat.\nHere's hoping the numerous driving lessons that will be occupying my schedule for the next few months will be a good investment of my time and, more importantly, my money.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nSufiyan Samsuri is a journalist at TODAY."

            "Article Body": "Online content on love and relationships such as the \"orange peel theory\" can be fun, but if you find yourself routinely turning to social media fads as a real-world litmus test for your partner, perhaps it’s a sign to hit pause and reflect, says this communications strategist.\nJust a few months ago, women took to TikTok in droves to share videos of themselves testing their partners’ love by asking them to peel an orange. \nIt was funny to watch this fad play out — Singaporeans even put their own spin on it by asking their partners to peel prawns instead. But it also makes one wonder how much weight we're putting on these touted ideals when we put our phones down.\nHaving grown up in the digital age, I've always been drawn to social media for guidance on everything from career to food, and relationships. With just a tap or scroll, we can easily access bite-sized advice tailored to our specific concerns. \nIn a world where time is of the essence and instant gratification is the norm, the quick fixes offered online are very appealing to modern young adults dealing with relationship dilemmas. \nBut I’ve begun to notice how toxic Internet dating content can seep into our real lives, subtly perpetuating harmful stereotypes and eroding the foundation of healthy relationships. \nFor women, such advice often trends towards glorifying jealousy, fixating on superficial signs like texting habits, and equating love with material wealth. \nOn the flip side, men are fed toxic messaging that discourages vulnerability, pressures them to become dominant “alpha males”, and promotes manipulative tactics like delaying responses to texts. \nTake, for instance, the catchy mantra-turned-meme: \"If he wanted to, he would.\" It seems simple — if your partner cared about you, he would act accordingly. \nBut people aren’t that simple. There are dangers that come with attempting to streamline the complexities of human emotions and motivations into a binary equation such as this.\nFood-related challenges, such as the quirky “orange peel theory” and the more recent “ketchup challenge” — which entails cleaning up spilled ketchup on camera — are designed to test a partner's devotion through trivial tasks. \nBut can we really judge the strength of our relationships based on such arbitrary acts? \nCreating unnecessary scenarios just to put our partners on display for public scrutiny and judgement is not only dehumanising but also undermines the trust and respect essential for healthy connection and intimacy. \nIt doesn’t help that many young adults are already under implicit pressure to measure the success of many aspects of their lives against what they see on social media. \nThe tendency to compare oneself to others is natural — however, social media amplifies the negative impacts of such comparison, especially among youths who spend a lot of time scrolling through peers' profiles. \nFor young people, repeated exposure to idealised portrayals of love and dating online can create feelings of inadequacy or insecurity, leading to discontent or disappointment in their own relationships. \nSome of my own friends have gotten caught up in replicating “relationship milestones” to the point where it became all about ticking off certain boxes: Posting perfect couple photos, marking anniversaries in unique, flashy ways, or staging elaborate displays of affection. \nIn chasing these external validations, we risk losing sight of what truly matters: The genuine emotional connection and compatibility we share with our partners.\nPopular social media platforms such as TikTok and Instagram run on algorithms that favour viral content. Trends that promote sensationalised or exaggerated relationship advice often pick up steam quickly and easily, quickly racking up millions of views.\nBut such content often lacks the depth needed to navigate the subjective nature of human relationships.\nSnappy catch phrases do well with gaining traction on social media, but don't consider personal struggles, communication barriers, geographical locations, or the fact that everyone expresses love differently. \nPerhaps it’s more useful to view catchy phrases and advice soundbites as food for thought.\nFor example, while TikTok videos of users testing out the orange peel theory saw millions of viewers tuning in, the theory’s popularity seemed to be overwhelmingly limited to girls and women — a group that is typically taught from a young age to prioritise and anticipate others' needs without complaint or concern for our own. \nCould it be that a seemingly arbitrary request of peeling an orange isn’t showing us if our partner loves us or not, but rather reflecting our own desire for our unvoiced needs to be met?\nIn the midst of the noise, how do we discern what's helpful from what's harmful? Here are some tips that I rely on.\nFirstly, exercise critical thinking. \nConsider the content's tone and approach: Who are they speaking to — a generalised group of people, or a specific type of individual in a specific type of situation? Are they promoting healthy communication and mutual understanding, or do they rely on popular but trite wisdom, or deceptively simple solutions? \nLook for sources backed by professionals, such as licensed therapists, or relationship experts with verifiable credentials.\nI've personally found a couple of accounts that I really resonate with, like @thesecurerelationship and @your.being. They're run by certified psychologists and relationship experts who offer genuine, evidence-based advice. \nLastly, never underestimate the power of open communication and mutual understanding in relationships. \nRegardless of what strangers are saying, the voice that matters most is that of yours and your partner's. Approach conversations with honesty, vulnerability, and a willingness to listen. \nIn the real world, a relationship between two persons demands open communication and mutual understanding, not snap assumptions based solely on actions prescribed by strangers or digital trends. \nLet's leave the oranges and ketchup in the kitchen, and focus on the real, authentic moments that can strengthen our bonds in a healthy way.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nNicole Chan is a communications strategist by trade, and a digital native by passion. Driven by areas where passion meets purpose, she is keen on igniting conversations for topics close to her heart such as intersectionality, DE&I, and sustainability."

            "Article Body": "\"Being an introvert, I could never bring myself to approach a stranger and engage in small talk. It felt unnatural and fake,\" writes the author, a UX designer. Here's how she managed to make networking less nerve-wracking for herself.\n \nHave you turned down invitations to networking events? Or attended a conference only to leave immediately after the scheduled speakers wrap up on stage, so that you can avoid the post-programme mingling?\nI have. \nBeing an introvert, networking made me cringe and my stomach churn. It made me want to turn and flee — and I often did.\nFor the first 15 years of my professional life, I avoided networking like the plague. \nOn the few occasions I absolutely had to attend a conference or an industry event, I mostly stood around awkwardly, watching some people breeze into the crowded room and effortlessly strike up a conversation with others like long-lost friends. \nI could never bring myself to approach a stranger — or worse, a group of strangers — and engage in small talk. It felt unnatural and “fake”. \nOver time, I convinced myself that networking just wasn't my cup of tea.\nTwo years ago, I embarked on a big career transition from procurement to user experience (UX) design. To improve at a faster rate, I wanted to meet more UX designers to learn about their experience and to seek feedback on my portfolio. \nFor once, I felt the push to reach out to others in the industry. I knew I had to do something to overcome my discomfort with networking.\nSo, for the first time in my life, I attended a networking event entirely out of my own volition. \nAnd I did it alone.\nMy heart was pounding fearfully as I stood by myself and scanned the crowd for a friendly face. \nI eventually mustered the courage to approach someone — a small business owner pivoting into UX design.\nWe ended up having a great conversation about our respective career transition experiences. \nIt turned out that she was also a user of my agency’s digital platform, so as a bonus, I managed to get some customer insights too.\nAfter crossing that first hurdle, I felt more at ease and confident, and it became easier to initiate conversations with the others at the event. \nAt the end of the day, I left the event happy, with a whole slate of new connections.\nThat day brought me to a realisation: By reframing how I felt about networking, I was able to let go of my self-doubt and insecurities.  \nInstead, I now see networking as just another skill that we can practise and get better at — just like learning a new sport or a new language.\nI also see how valuable networking can be. It can help you to open new doors, learn something new, or just to make new friends.\nTruthfully, I still feel awkward at the start of each event — but by the end, I always have something valuable to take away with me when I leave. \nHere are some tips I picked up over time to make networking less nerve-wracking for me.\n#1: Know your ‘why’\nTo reduce your social anxiety, go in with a broader objective than purely to “network”. \nAsk yourself: Why are you attending this event in the first place? Take the pressure off yourself by redirecting the focus to other people or things.\nFor example, I attend events that focus on key topics or feature speakers that I’m already interested in. When I’m going to an event with the purpose of learning something, the “networking” part becomes less of a sticking point in my head. \n#2: Start with small goals \nAre you networking in a bid to score a job referral, or to make 10 new connections? \nIf lofty goals such as these seem overwhelming to you, you can always start small. Aiming to make just one new connection can be enough. \n#3: Make genuine connections \nNetworking can often feel “fake”. It can feel like you’re going around trying to promote yourself to people you don’t know — and that can be extremely uncomfortable for introverts like me. \nIt doesn’t have to be this way. \nIntroverts often excel in active listening, and they thrive in intimate, small settings. Use that strength to your advantage, and seek to make genuine connections. \nFor my part, I strive to approach new connections with a curious mindset: With each new person I meet, I aim to learn at least one interesting thing about them. This makes the engagement meaningful and reduces the discomfort about making “small talk” with strangers for no real reason. \n#4: Prepare and practise \nStarting conversations can be daunting for many introverts.\nOne reason for my anxiety was that I was just not prepared enough. I never thought about how I was going to introduce myself, what questions I would ask, and how I would exit the conversation. \nPreparing and practising beforehand can give you that extra boost of confidence. \nOver time, it will become more natural and you will find that you don't need so much practice before the event. \n#5: Go alone\nThis may seem counterintuitive. After all, you’re already anxious about networking. Shouldn’t you attend such an event with a friend or someone familiar for support? \nHear me out. \nIn my experience, whenever I go to an event with a friend — especially another introvert — chances are the two of us will end up spending the entire time engaged in conversation with each other. We miss out on opportunities to connect with other people. \nGoing alone pushes me out of my comfort zone, so that I have more reason to take the first step to interact with someone new.\nLet’s say you went out on a limb and attended a networking event alone, doing your best to employ the tips and tricks above. It’s possible that you may still fail to meet anyone new. \nIf you didn’t manage to make any new connections, or if you didn’t even make it to the mingling portion of the event (like I struggled to before), don’t be too hard on yourself. \nIt’s not the end. There’s always another opportunity. \nLike with learning any new skill, what’s more important is that after each attempt, you reflect on what went well and how you can do better. \nIf you did manage to meet new people, give yourself a pat on the back. Note down what you did to help you achieve that, and think about how you can repeat it or improve further upon it the next time round. \nAs with any skill, the only way to get better and strengthen our confidence is to allow ourselves to practise and learn from our own mistakes. \nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nFiona Lee is a former procurement professional turned UX designer in the public sector. She now crafts digital experiences for individuals and businesses."

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "As artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI continue to rapidly evolve and reshape our lives, safeguarding our children has never been more critical. \nEarlier this year, the chief executives of five major social media companies testified in a US Senate hearing on Big Tech and the online child sexual exploitation crisis, sparking a heated debate on child online safety and mental health. \nCurrently, researchers vary in their views on the effects of technology use on children's well-being. That said, what we do know is that social media use and mental health problems in youths have increased in tandem; more and more studies are finding links between the two in several contexts. \nWhat all experts seem to agree on is that tech industries and governments alike need to work to create better online environments for our children. \nIn the midst of all this, the integration of AI into various digital platforms and services has introduced new complexities to the online safety landscape. \nAs parents, guardians, and caregivers, we need to understand both the potential benefits and risks associated with AI and equip ourselves with the knowledge and tools needed to navigate these complexities effectively.\nHere are some ways in which AI complicates things:\nEnhanced personalisation: AI algorithms used by popular streaming platforms analyse user data to recommend content tailored to individual preferences, potentially exposing children to inappropriate material beyond parental control.\nDeepfakes and manipulated content: AI enables the creation of hyper-realistic deepfake videos. This allows malicious actors to fabricate content that can deceive and harm children, such as fake celebrity endorsements of dangerous or illicit materials or altered news clips spreading wrong or misleading information.\nAlgorithmic bias: Social media platforms employ AI algorithms that may inadvertently amplify biases against certain demographics, resulting in discriminatory content distribution and fostering negative perceptions among children based on factors like ethnicity, gender, or socio-economic status.\nPrivacy concerns: AI-driven smart toys and devices, such as smart speakers and interactive dolls, often collect and store children's personal data without robust privacy protections, raising concerns about unauthorised access, data breaches, and potential exploitation by third parties for targeted advertising or identity theft.\nWhile AI introduces new challenges to online safety, it is also a promising tool in bolstering online safety measures with its advanced algorithms that can swiftly analyse vast amounts of data, allowing for the rapid identification and mitigation of potential threats and harmful content. \nHere's how AI can be leveraged to enhance online safety for children:\nContent moderation: Platforms like TikTok and Instagram use AI algorithms to automatically flag and remove inappropriate content, such as violent or explicit videos in violation of their community standards, ensuring a safer browsing experience for young users.\nAdaptive parental controls: Apps like Google Family Link and Apple Screen Time employ AI algorithms to analyse children's online activities and adjust parental controls accordingly, allowing parents to set limits on specific apps, websites, or screen time based on their child's age and behaviour.\nCybersecurity solutions: AI-driven cybersecurity software like CrowdStrike and Halcyon  utilise machine learning algorithms and generative AI to detect and block online threats, such as viruses, malware, and phishing attempts, protecting children's devices and personal information from cyberattacks.\nDigital well-being features: Platforms like Apple iOS and Android devices offer digital well-being features powered by AI algorithms that monitor screen time, track app usage, and provide insights into device usage patterns, helping parents and children maintain a healthy balance between online and offline activities.\nWhile AI-driven solutions and regulations can contribute to maintaining online safety, parents and caregivers also need to get closely involved. Here are practical recommendations on how to further enhance your children's online safety:\nEstablish open communication: A recent survey by the Ministry of Communications and Information highlighted that parents are not always aware of children’s online gaming activities. It's essential to establish a supportive and open dialogue with your children about their online experiences. Continually encourage them to share what they enjoy about these activities and to ask questions where they’re unsure, fostering an environment where they feel comfortable discussing any concerns or incidents they may encounter. \nPrioritise digital literacy for the whole family: Digital literacy impacts the necessary skills needed to thrive alongside AI and to be resilient both online and offline. Begin by educating yourself about various aspects of technology, including AI, and best online safety practices. By teaching family members, especially children, about responsible online behaviour — such as respecting others’ privacy and protecting their own, avoiding cyberbullying, and critically evaluating information — they can navigate the online world responsibly and identify potential risks and threats.\nCo-create rules around usage: Nurture a collaborative approach within your family to co-create boundaries and rules regarding screen time, appropriate content consumption, and online interactions. Rely on expert guidance to create these rules and regularly review and adjust these guidelines as needed to ensure they remain relevant and effective in promoting a healthy and balanced digital lifestyle for everyone. \nLead by example: There is mounting evidence that how parents use digital media can have a big impact on their children’s development. Be mindful of your own online behaviours and habits, as children often model their behaviour based on their parents'. Set a positive example as a technology role model by promoting quality tech use for your children. This can involve dedicating phone-free time each day to do activities with your child or choosing online activities together that are educational and enriching, like playing games, exploring videos and tutorials on hobbies such as painting, crafts, gardening etc.  \nStay informed and engaged: Engage with your children's digital experiences to understand their behaviour, enabling you to monitor any sudden and unexpected changes in mood and well-being. Rather than avoiding new technologies like AI out of fear, it’s important to stay updated on the latest trends and developments, so you can both appreciate their vast possibilities while maintaining safety for you and your kids in this new digital age.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nDr Gayathri Haridas is a policy manager at public policy consultancy Access Partnership where her work focuses on the impact of digital technologies on society.

            "Article Body": "The author, who suffers from spinal muscular atrophy, says new drugs could greatly improve his quality of life. Even so, he’s in no hurry to take costly medications to which continued, consistent access cannot be guaranteed due to the exorbitant price tag.\nAt this year’s Committee of Supply debate, Nominated Member of Parliament Ong Hua Han asked the Ministry of Health (MOH) to consider extending financial help for patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) to access disease-modifying treatments. Such treatments improve patients’ quality of life, but are not full-fledged cures.\nHe cited a crowdfunding campaign by Singaporean games journalist Sherry Toh, who is trying to raise S$375,000 for a one-year supply of the drug Evrysdi (risdiplam), an oral medication to be taken daily. Evrysdi is the only treatment option registered with and approved by our Health Sciences Authority.\nAnother treatment, Zolgensma, is a one-time gene therapy, but must be administered before a child turns two years old. It costs upwards of S$2 million. \nChildren in Singapore have access to Zolgensma on a compassionate use basis. A few have managed to benefit from this drug, following successful crowdfunding campaigns to raise the millions of dollars needed.\nSMA, which I am also affected by, is a congenital neuromuscular disorder in which the nerve cells that carry messages from the brain to the rest of the body weaken and die, causing progressive muscle weakness. \nMost patients are unable to stand or sit unsupported. As the disease worsens, problems with swallowing, speaking, and breathing occur.\nSMA is a rare disease — according to a 2023 MOH statement, there are only about 40 to 50 patients in Singapore. It is also terminal.\nI’ve never been one to sugarcoat or romanticise my condition. The fact is: It sucks. \nI can’t do many things most people would consider routine, like moving around independently or eating delicious food. Even the simple things that I can do for myself take huge reserves of energy, and I find myself tired and in discomfort all the time.\nBecause of SMA, I will never experience many wonderful facets of life: A rollercoaster ride; a night out drinking at the bar; having a kid and teaching him to play football.\nWith the advent of disease-modifying treatments (DMTs), especially when administered to a young child who is still in the early stages of the disease, these things are no longer a pipe dream.\nChildren in the United States who were given Zolgensma as newborns several years ago are now running around schoolyards with their friends — something that would have been unfathomable a decade ago.\nCloser to home, Ms Toh noted on her campaign page that her ability to swallow water improved after she received a complimentary three-month supply of Evrysdi on a compassionate basis from manufacturer Roche. \nBefore, she would have taken about 52 seconds to drink a given amount of water. After starting on the drug, her time decreased to 16 seconds. \nDMTs have changed the SMA landscape forever. But every discussion on DMTs in Singapore runs into the same issue: Cost.\nIn the US, insurance covers the cost of DMTs and allows ready access to those who need it. \nHere in Singapore, though, patients have no option at the moment but to figure out a way to pay the exorbitant price tag on their own.\nHere are my rough calculations: If I want to get treated with Evrysdi, I would have to work my white-collar office job for more than five years to save up enough for a single year of treatment.\nThis is why I’m ambivalent about even starting on the drug, which relies on taking consistent doses in order to sustain its effects.\nWhat happens if I no longer have access to this costly drug? The joys and freedoms, and the improvements to my quality of life it would bring — all those positive effects would go away in an instant.\nIt seems really cruel to put myself through that. And so, I’d rather not commit to the treatment while financial cost is still the biggest stumbling block to my continued access to it.\nI don’t enjoy having SMA — but after 26 years, I’ve come to terms with it. I’ve become used to living my life while working around the ever-increasing limitations my disease places on me.\nI’m in no hurry to plunge myself into a situation where I have to constantly worry about running out of money to buy medicine, or be subject to the trauma of finding myself robbed of my newfound strength and independence all over again.\nDon’t get me wrong: I’m not saying I don’t want medicine that could better my life.\nIf our health insurance system suddenly became like the US’s overnight, and I could access Evrysdi with little worry about the price, I would take it in a heartbeat.\nBut the reality is that our system is set up completely differently. It’s not my intention to “fix” our system with this piece — plenty of other highly qualified writers and experts have suggested solutions to the affordability problems facing rare disease treatment.\nFor example, the Rare Disease Fund (RDF) could potentially help SMA patients afford DMTs, if SMA gets added to the list of diseases it covers.\nBut even if so, the RDF has a very small quantity of funds available to it, and a growing quantity of demand on these funds. SMA is just one of a whole constellation of rare diseases out there, and treatments for all of them are just as expensive, if not more so.\nIt would of course be ideal to help every patient who needs support — but we don’t live in an ideal world. Funds are finite. There are only two options: Be selective in who gets help, or get more funds.\nGetting more funds is, in turn, a whole other can of worms because of opportunity cost. \nIf the government allocates more money to the RDF, that’s money taken away from some other use or need, like education or assisting the elderly or cushioning the impact of inflation on the lower income. \nAt the governmental level, I trust Singapore is doing the best it can for the RDF.\nThat brings us back to being selective in who gets help. \nUnfortunately, allocating resources is, by nature, a zero-sum game.\nLet me put it this way: If the RDF has to choose between subsidising treatment for me or a young child also suffering from SMA, I’d rather medical help goes to the kid.\nStopping his SMA progression at a much earlier stage means he will retain more of his physical abilities and strength. \nHe will have his whole life ahead of him, giving him a much longer runway to do lots of amazing things that I can only dream of.\nWhile we figure out how to address the funding gap, one intermediate step I do wish for the authorities to consider is to make SMA testing more prevalent in Singapore.\nMany developed nations screen newborns for SMA through a simple blood test. According to Novartis, which developed Zolgensma, 45 per cent of babies in Europe are tested for SMA at birth. This compares to 44 per cent in Australia and an impressive 80 per cent in Taiwan.\nEarly detection of SMA is crucial in the age of DMTs because the sooner the patient begins treatment, the better the outcome in the long run.\nBesides rolling out more widespread newborn screening for SMA, I’d like Singapore to dream even bigger: Introduce routine carrier testing for the gene that causes SMA. This is also possible through a simple blood test.\nI understand from my relatives’ experiences with starting a family that, currently, couples are advised to get tested for the gene only if they have a family member with SMA like me.\nBut with one in 40 people carrying the SMA gene, there are actually many people out there who are blissfully unaware. All it takes is for two of them to procreate, and their child will have a 25 per cent chance of having SMA.\nI personally always encourage my newly married friends to ask for the test before having kids. \nIf couples are aware of their carrier status before they try for a baby, they will be in a better position to make an informed decision on whether to go ahead with reproductive efforts or consider alternatives such as adoption.\nUltimately, SMA is a devastating disease which incurs costs that go far beyond the financial. The physical and psychological toll it takes on patients and their families cannot be quantified.\nMaking any decisions regarding SMA — or any other rare disease for that matter — is a highly personal affair involving a complex interplay of each individual’s dreams, fears, beliefs, values, and life circumstances.\nThere are no easy or correct answers, but with the knowledge we have available to us at any given moment, we can make the decision that feels right for us, and then make the best of it.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nJonathan Tiong, 26, works in corporate communications and employee engagement.

            "Article Body": "Moving out as a young single is undoubtedly costly, but why do Singaporeans judge others for how they choose to manage their own money as well as their mental and emotional well-being? A TODAY deputy editor explores the question: What if it’s not really about numbers in bank accounts, but about our ideas of “failure”?\nFor young Singaporeans, the Covid-19 pandemic brought on several changes to life as we’d known it. Most learnt to adjust to remote work — some irrevocably so. Many picked up new hobbies and interests that pre-pandemic busyness had kept them from pursuing.\nAnd some realised that they just can’t live at home anymore. \nThis week, TODAY’s mental health series Gen Zen explored the difficult dilemmas young singles face in deciding whether or not to move out of their family homes due to strained relations. \nYouths and mental health experts weighed in on how living independently can affect one’s well-being in both positive and negative ways: No one to bug you with endless nagging and questions, thumbs up! No one to help you with housework and chores, thumbs down. \nGiven that young singles choosing to move out has long been a contentious topic in Singapore, perhaps it’s only natural that the column sparked a debate from readers and other members of the public.\nDespite the mental health benefits laid out by both this piece as well as many others already published on the subject in recent years, many felt that for young Singaporeans, the cons of moving out still far outweigh the pros.\nLet’s be real, these people said, there’s no way any amount of mental or emotional gain can make the financial cost of living independently worth it — especially as this cost continues to climb amid economic squeezes and pressures.\nEven if you manage to make enough to afford rent, said these dissenters, you may not actually be ridding yourself of the stresses that accompany living at home.\nThey pointed out that in your desperation to escape friction or tension with your family, you could end up saddled with bad housemates or, even worse, a “nightmare” landlord. Same problem, different roof.\nAll in all, this camp advised: Don’t make the mistake of giving up long-term financial gains for short-term peace of mind.\nEven so, many others stood by the intangible benefits of living away from one’s family.\nIt’s not only about getting away from unhealthy or toxic situations, many said, but to gain some healthy growth and independence that would better prepare and ease one into full adulthood.\nA few rebutted the potential problem of difficult roommates or landlords by highlighting that such situations are useful opportunities for acquiring and practising various skills required for living harmoniously with others — undoubtedly valuable knowledge for Singaporeans, given the way our country’s land constraints require most of us to live in close quarters. \nSome shared how moving out early had greased the wheels on their progression into living with their current partners or spouses.\nSeveral added that living away from one’s family also makes it easier to have a love life — an unquestionable boon for Singapore, surely, given youths’ rising rates of singlehood and the downward slide of our birth rate.\nMoving out is a big change for anyone at any stage of life. For this — and for any other major decision, really — the scale on which we balance the pros and cons aren’t weighted the same way for everyone. \nFor some, the benefits of moving out far outstrip the costs. For others, the price of freedom and independence will never be justified. \nEven so, why do we feel the need to judge others for how they choose to manage their own money, as well as their mental and emotional well-being?\nOne Reddit user, AivernT, put this forth as the underlying “crux” of the entire debate: “We are so conditioned to hyper-optimise our finances to hit every milestone that any deviation appears to be considered a failure.”\nFrom this perspective, what we’re really worried about isn’t numbers in bank accounts. It’s about how we internalise our fellow Singaporeans choosing to make what we personally perceive to be a mistake — choosing “failure”.\nBut why is this such a sensitive trigger for us?\nSingaporeans are well conditioned to avoid and guard against failure. As a small nation with grand ambitions and limited resources, we haven’t had much chance to enjoy a large margin for error, historically speaking. \nBut now, nearly six decades into independence, our countless achievements speak for themselves. Singapore’s rise-and-grind culture has also earned us a global reputation for unparalleled hustlerdom. \nPerhaps we’ve done more than enough to earn ourselves a little breathing room. Some space to take a step back instead of letting all that conditioning prod us into deploring each other’s individual decisions, even when we don’t personally agree with the logic behind each one.\nRetooling the overwhelming instinct to avoid failure at all costs starts with retooling our understanding of what “failure” even is. \nA couple of responses offered up a new lens through which to calculate the cost-benefit analysis of moving out: Improving one's mental health environment may be a boost to one’s ability to perform far better in the workplace — which, in turn, could drastically improve one’s financial prospects. \nTo one person, renting may be “throwing away money”. To another, it could be a crucial investment not only in their current well-being, but also their future growth. \nOf course, it’s still important to make wise decisions in life — keeping in mind that “wise” may look different for each one of us. \nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nMelissa Lee Suppiah is a deputy editor at TODAY where she oversees commentaries.

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "The topic of menstruation is unquestionably still on the taboo list, and it is clearly affecting the workplace. A management researcher asks: How can we make workplaces more inclusive for people who menstruate?\nHave you ever felt sick at work? Perhaps you had food poisoning or the flu. Your belly hurt, or you felt tired, making it hard to concentrate and be productive.\nHow likely would you be to tell your boss you were unwell and had to go home?\nWhile employees would probably tell their boss about a stomach upset, many who menstruate and feel unwell as a consequence every month, are unlikely to talk about their difficult periods.\nEspecially at work. This was confirmed in our recent study of 247 students and workers who have periods. We found only 6.7 per cent would be honest with their employer about why they had to leave work or stay at home.\nAdditionally, 87 per cent of those surveyed — 96 per cent identified as women — felt their period often interfered with their work or study.\nOne respondent told us, “I would sometimes just say I wasn’t well and needed to work from home to be near a bathroom. I would let people assume it was gastro.”\nAnother said, “I do not feel comfortable giving this as a reason to miss work as it feels like an excuse despite living in chronic pain.”\nThe topic of menstruation is unquestionably still on the taboo list. And it is also clearly affecting the workplace.\nThe good news is we are starting to see initiatives aimed at making workplaces more inclusive for people who menstruate.\nHaving access to free period products seems to be paying off as our research found 84.6 per cent of employees said it makes them feel their workplace cares about them and reduces the likelihood they will leave work due to their period.\nOne respondent explained, “Periods can be hard. I once bled through my clothes at work and had to leave. It was so stressful and humiliating. Free period products could just change someone’s day.”\nThis is encouraging, but also suggests accessible products alone won’t lift the taboo and support a menstrual-inclusive workplace. More needs to be done.\n1) Recognise the impact of periods\nOur study identified people who menstruate regularly experience physical symptoms such as abdominal pain (94 per cent), backache (82 per cent), and headaches (82 per cent) before or during their period.\nThey also describe emotional symptoms such as anxiety, fatigue, depression and irritability.\nOne respondent said: “My cramps are so painful they make me feel physically sick — as though I will throw up. So I don’t like being out of the house because I can’t stand up straight.”\nAnd another: “My period increases my general level of anxiety in class, at work, and in all other situations. It can cause me to be acutely anxious during my classes and work, and I struggle to concentrate.”\nTo avoid feelings of humiliation, shame and discrimination, people with their period often mask and hide symptoms. When this happens, employees report being less engaged and productive.\nBy empathising with menstruators who are impacted in a wide variety of ways, organisations can support and empower them to look after their general and menstrual well-being.\n2) Become an inclusive leader\nInclusive leaders treat menstrual health as a justice and human rights issue that is collectively important for individuals and the organisation.\nThese leaders recognise people with their period should be supported, so they talk to them about cultural and practical ways the workplace can make them feel safe and allow them to manage their period with dignity.\nThis might mean providing free period products or offering menstruators flexible breaks and work hours when having their periods. Inclusive leaders recognise some people may need paid menstrual leave.\n3) Normalise discussions about menstruation\nInclusive leaders go further than practical strategies, they create a period-positive environment by challenging stigma and discrimination.\nThey normalise conversations about menstruation, and ensure people who menstruate feel heard, supported and respected. They offer education and training to dismantle the menstrual taboo in workplaces, and replace it with a culture that embraces menstrual wellbeing.\nUltimately, to make our workplaces equitable and inclusive, we must be willing to talk about menstruation openly and honestly and learn about the impact it has on employees.\nOnly then will workers feel able to talk about what supports their health needs.

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "Many young adults might not see the urgency of proper insurance coverage now — but there are dangers in overlooking the potential risks and financial burdens that can arise from unexpected events.\nThe Life Insurance Association in Singapore in 2022 reported a critical illness protection gap of 74 per cent or S$579 billion for economically active Singaporeans aged between 20 and 69 in Singapore. \nThe protection gap refers to the difference between the level of financial protection one has and what one actually needs to safeguard against potential risks. \nBeing underinsured means one is not sufficiently covered for unexpected events, leading to unwanted financial challenges. \nClosing this gap to ensure sufficient protection for medical emergencies, accidents, and unforeseen expenses is crucial for bolstering one’s financial security. \nMore urgently, this gap is increasingly widening across generational lines. \nIn a 2023 survey on Gen Z insurance trends by FWD Singapore, more than 68 per cent of Gen Z respondents indicated that they do not have coverage for critical illness events such as cancer, stroke, and heart attacks.\nEvery generation is shaped by different backgrounds, circumstances, values and perspectives — differences which are reflected in their insurance needs and attitudes as well. \nThe post-war generation (or baby boomers), generally aged above 60, largely tended to focus on retirement planning and healthcare, necessitating life insurance for estate planning and long-term care coverage. \nGeneration X, in their 40s and 50s, strive to balance multiple financial responsibilities, requiring coverage for mortgages, dependents, and potential long-term care. \nIn contrast, when it comes to millennials and Gen Z, there is a clear shift in insurance needs and priorities. \nMillennials, in their late 20s to early 40s, seek financial security for growing families, emphasising affordable health insurance and financial protection for debt obligations. \nGen Z is the largest global generation, with its members reporting growing spending power and changing spending habits, according to Nielsen’s data. \nHowever, being teens and young adults in their early 20s, they are still only at the outset of their financial journeys. As such, they gravitate towards digital platforms and accessible insurance that lay the groundwork for their financial protection journey.\nAs these emerging generations become significant consumer markets, insurers face a critical question: How can they better understand and cater to the changing needs of modern young adults? \nMore and more data show that young adults prioritise meaningful work, flexibility, and autonomy over stable, linear career paths. \nIn Singapore, a growing number of Gen Zs (46 per cent) and millennials (37 per cent) have taken on either a part- or full-time paying second job, showed research by Deloitte in 2023. \nThis signifies a broader, more adaptable approach to work, that may encompass remote work, side hustles, and entrepreneurial pursuits. \nThere are also diverse needs and different segments among young adults — from fresh graduates navigating their first steps into the job market, to gap-year takers in search of meaningful experiences, to those seeking conventional and unconventional routes to wealth accumulation. \nThis shift not only transforms individual professional journeys but also impacts considerations in insurance coverage. \nNotably, research indicates that early retirement is becoming an increasingly popular concept among millennials and Gen Zs. Financial planning and investment patterns for this group of consumers will likely need to be altered accordingly. \nMany young adults might not see the urgency of this need now. Having had less time to gain and accumulate wealth at their age, insurance is not often top of mind for Gen Zers and millennials. \nThe everyday young adult often navigates life with a sense of invincibility, believing that insurance coverage is a concern for older generations or unforeseeable emergencies. \nHowever, this perception overlooks the potential risks and financial burdens that can arise from unexpected events. \nWhile youth may bring a sense of vitality and freedom, it also comes with its own set of responsibilities, including the need to protect oneself against unforeseen circumstances.\nInitial responses from Gen Z respondents and feedback from younger clients and customers outside of the survey suggest that they largely perceive insurance as complex and costly. \nAs such, efforts to inform and educate younger generations more widely and effectively are vital, to bridge the growing gap between their evolving life goals and insurance needs. \nSome financial services providers have begun launching programmes to introduce basic financial literacy concepts to students. Educating younger children and teens on simple approaches to money management and building a strong financial foundation is an important first step.\nYoung adults need to understand that proper coverage extends beyond just health insurance to manage medical expenses. Other types of coverage, such as home insurance, motor insurance, and even life insurance, play significant roles in safeguarding one's financial well-being.\nInvesting in insurance at a younger age often translates to lower premiums, as insurers typically consider younger individuals to be lower-risk. This means that securing insurance coverage early provides assurance, but it can also be a financially savvy decision in the long run. \nA few insurance providers are already offering simpler, more straightforward and affordable plans that can form the foundational blocks of critical illness plans, some starting from just S$20,000 sum insured. Opting for a smaller coverage is always recommended to having no coverage at all.\nAs millennials and Gen Zers navigate flexible career paths, re-evaluate professional and financial goals and contemplate early retirement, it may be tempting to overlook the overarching importance of insurance coverage in their everyday lives — but the reality is that insurance serves as a crucial safety net for unforeseen events and financial hardships. \nBy prioritising adequate coverage, they protect themselves and their assets, but also pave their own way for a more secure and resilient future. \nTackling the responsibility of insurance today ensures that they can confidently navigate whatever challenges tomorrow may bring, allowing them to focus on pursuing their goals with peace of mind.\nOn insurers’ part, more effort and resources need to be channelled towards tailoring approaches to meet the needs of young adults. The shifting values and aspirations of this demographic signal a need for providers to innovate and align with these evolving demands.\nMaking moves to stay adaptable now will not only serve the current populace but also help to safeguard the coverage needs of future generations. \nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nAdrian Vincent is the chief executive officer of FWD Singapore.\nDisclaimer: \nThis article is for general information only and shall not be considered as financial advice.

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "Research finds that humble leaders gain respect, prestige and prominence, and they gather a group of followers with high human capital. These experts say: If you want to be more promotable, it may pay to stay humble.\nWhen we consider how leaders get to the top, we might think of somebody like Jordan Belfort, the millionaire stock broker portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio in The Wolf of Wall Street. And humility is probably not the word that comes to mind.\nHowever, Belfort’s rise was followed by a fall (he ended up in jail).\nFor those who want to reach the top and stay there, it may be best to stay humble.\nHumble leaders express their humility in three dimensions.\nThey view themselves accurately and acknowledge their limitations. They show appreciation for their followers’ contributions. They are also open to ideas and feedback.\nWhen leaders show all three attributes, they are considered to be humble.\nSo how can humility help those who want to reach the top?\nWe studied how humble leaders can become more promotable and found that they accomplish that by growing others in what is known as a “humility route”.\nHuman capital theory suggests that employees’ value can be enhanced by investing in their knowledge, skills and abilities. It’s not only important for employees, it also creates value for organisations.\nUsing human capital theory, our research shows that humble leaders focus on the learning and growth of their followers. By doing so, they also create human capital value for themselves in the process.\nHumble leaders tend to engage in more informal mentoring, and through that they gain influence and power in terms of promotability. They provide career guidance to their proteges and help them to prosper.\nBut at the same time, their engagement in learning also boosts their own human capital. In such a developmental relationship, humble leaders gain respect, prestige and prominence, and they gather a group of followers with high human capital.\nThis enhances their status in the organisation. It’s a win-win for leaders, their followers and the organisations they work for.\nOur study used survey data from a sample of 610 leaders who worked in 18 industries and across 21 job functions. The leaders’ direct followers, peers, immediate bosses and superiors reported back on the leaders.\nThe measures in the survey included the leader’s humility, informal mentoring, status and promotability. We found that humble leaders earn higher status and enhanced promotability through engaging in mentoring behaviours.\nSo if you want to be more promotable, it may pay to stay humble.\nBut why are some leaders so arrogant if there is a “humility route” to success?\nA great deal of evidence shows that humble leaders outperform arrogant leaders. And yet, many leaders at every level have a hard time admitting mistakes, praising followers’ strengths and being teachable.\nThe arrogant, narcissistic, bullying and dominating Wolf of Wall Street stereotype may be the most common and immediate route to the top. After all, this sort of behaviour can lead to quick wins which are are easily noticed and glamourised, reinforcing the stereotype in popular culture and media.\nBut while this path can offer short-term gains, it often lacks stability. Even the famed Renaissance Italian political theorist Niccolo Machiavelli — a well-known figure of dominance strategy — ended up being tortured, imprisoned and then exiled.\nIn contrast, humility offers a more stable and less visible route to success. Humble leaders typically achieve their status through fostering growth in others, engaging in mentoring, and creating a network of highly capable, loyal and enthusiastic followers.\nThis network in turn provides the humble leader with high status, leading to them being viewed favourably by superiors. But such an approach may not grab attention or fit the dramatic narratives preferred by media, making it less visible to the public.\nThe key difference lies in the nature of success each approach brings. Dominance may lead to a rapid ascent but is often accompanied by volatility.\nHumility, on the other hand, cultivates a foundation of strong relationships and a positive reputation, leading to a more stable and enduring success. This explains why the Wolf of Wall Street stereotype persists, despite the proven benefits of humility in achieving long-term leadership success.\nExpressing humility helps leaders earn career success as they increase human capital, which is vital to organisations. In recent years there has been a growing interest in humility in the workplace, particularly among leaders. It’s time to re-evaluate perceptions about the value of humility in leadership.\nYou can show more humility as you lead. You can evaluate your own limitations and be sensitive to them. You can try to admit them by saying, “This is something I could do better.”\nYou can also put your focus on the followers, acknowledge what they have done well and give them positive feedback. You can also be more open to feedback yourself and consider your followers’ ideas more.\nThere are a few ways that organisations can cultivate humility. They can build the perception that expressing humility is valued. They can also organise training programmes that develop humility in leaders and consider including humility as part of performance evaluations.\nAnd lastly, they can encourage feedback on humble behaviours, promote informal mentoring and foster a culture of humility that centres on learning. That way, they can develop groups of employees who focus on the “humility route” to career success.

            "Article Body": "\nThe new guidelines on flexible work arrangements aren’t meant to be a perfect solution, but a starting point that forces employers to come to the table and listen to their staff. Whether that conversation results in a win-win outcome depends on both sides' willingness to give and take, says this TODAY deputy editor.\nAs a kid, I asked and pleaded and begged my mum for a puppy. \nWhenever she ran out of ways to dodge the question, she’d bring out the big guns: “Ask Dad.” She was confident that Dad would say no, and that would be the end of it.\nBut what happens when Dad doesn’t say no?\nOn Tuesday (April 16), a tripartite workgroup unveiled the Tripartite Guidelines on Flexible Work Arrangement Requests. \nIn these guidelines, the group — a collaboration between the Ministry of Manpower, National Trades Union Congress and Singapore National Employers Federation — stipulates that all Singapore firms should set up processes to receive and handle formal requests from employees for flexible work arrangements.\nThis should come as no surprise, with the overwhelming majority of young adults continuing to prefer remote or hybrid working arrangements even as we put the Covid-19 pandemic in the rear-view mirror. In 2023, most of Singapore’s Gen Zers (69 per cent) and millennials (70 per cent) said they would seek out job opportunities elsewhere if their current employer were to mandate full-time on-site work, according to Deloitte research. \nAs vocal as workers have been about not returning to the office full-time, employers have been just as vocal about wanting them back in the workplace. In October 2023, LinkedIn reported that seven out of 10 leaders in Asia-Pacific believed their companies would be “forced to wind back progress” on flexible working. \nAfter spending all of 2023 circling each other like two rival boxers in a ring, it seems the two opposing sentiments are finally coming to a head — and Tuesday’s announcement may have just rung the bell.\nMembers of the public poured into the stadium to place their bets, alternating between hollering support and huffing displeasure. \nA large group quickly arrived at the conclusion that the move was, ultimately, a toothless display — a whole lot of fanfare over no real, tangible change.\nWorkers can now request flexible work arrangements — so what? Companies can still easily reject such requests, they said. Big deal.\nMany took it upon themselves to remind others that employers are “not that nice”, with several voicing fears and expectations that workers will likely rue the day they attempted such requests (or have such requests granted) when their performance appraisals are negatively affected, not to mention their salaries or bonuses.\nEven if this comes out to something, said some, such a move will still be “unfair”. After all, not everyone would be able to benefit from such flexibility, including service and frontline workers. Equality fails again. \nAnother camp of spectators threw their support behind the move. It may not be much, they said, but at the very least, it’s a step forward for better worker welfare in Singapore.\nFor young adults, access to flexible work arrangements makes it easier to take care of ageing parents and relatives as well as kids. For older folks, flexibility enhances their ability to find and keep jobs as they age. \nYes, non-office workers may never have this privilege or possibility, but that’s all the more reason to count your blessings, advised this group.\nMany also said that opening up such requests could be a step towards addressing other chronic issues in Singapore — for instance, nudging the nation’s minimum annual leave requirement up from the current seven days.\nAt first glance, the new guidelines seem like a classic case of splitting the baby. As the saying goes: “No one is very happy, which means it’s a good compromise.”\nWe can’t seem to agree on whether this is a step forward, backward, or even sideways. But what if it’s not a step in any direction at all?\nReally, the new guidelines are an opening: A door to more conversations between employers and employees about how to re-evaluate and improve both business performance as well as worker welfare. \nSo maybe the real point we’re all missing is this: What does it say about Singapore work culture that this door wasn’t already open to begin with?  \nInterestingly, a decent chunk of responses chose to warn of \"abuse\" of flexible work arrangements on both sides of the aisle: Greater freedom means employees will go MIA or slack off; greater remote access and looser structures means employers will make staff work after hours and on public holidays. \nClearly, the issue is not really about who's in the office and when. It’s about trust between bosses and workers. \nAnd that trust seems to have broken somewhere along the way — more inimically than we’ve all realised.\nRepairing that trust starts with recalibrating our base view of jobs and work. \nAt the end of the day, nobody wants to do badly at their job and nobody wants their company to fail. Of course, there are always occasional exceptions to the rule, but broadly speaking, we’ve all got that Majulah Singapura mindset — we all want better outcomes for our careers and businesses, as well as ourselves. \nWe’re all on the same side. It’s not a zero-sum competition. It's give and take, not win or lose.\nBut the simple truth is this: Expecting any one single move, no matter how big or small, to be a one-size-fits-all fix for all our problems will never turn out well. \nThese guidelines aren’t meant to be a perfect solution, but a starting point that forces employers to come to the table and listen to their staff. Whether that conversation results in a win-win outcome depends on both sides' willingness to give and take.\nTo be honest, I never got that puppy. Dad said no. \nBut I did get to give a pretty cool five-minute presentation on why I thought I deserved that puppy — a presentation that earned me two hamsters.\nIn the public debate on flexible working arrangements, we don’t have to split the baby, and we definitely don’t have to throw it out with the bathwater. \nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nMelissa Lee Suppiah is a deputy editor at TODAY where she oversees commentaries.

            "Article Body": "When a racial slur is used, it’s common for everyone — including the victim — to carry on as though nothing has happened. But, asks this senior lecturer in human resource management, what if we all didn’t pretend to be unaffected and indifferent to such events?\nIn Singapore, the uttering of words with the deliberate intention of wounding the racial feelings of a person is an offence under Section 298 of the Penal Code, punishable with imprisonment of up to three years, a fine, or both. \nYet, uses of racial slurs continue, particularly against members of the Indian ethnic minority.  \nEvery time such an incident makes it to national news, I feel a sense of violation and betrayal. As a member of this minority group, I do not need to be on the receiving end of racialised hate to experience, indirectly, the hurt and rejection inflicted upon the actual victims for the way they look.\nMembers of dominant groups often perceive conversations about these events to be difficult, sensitive and high-risk. As such, it is common for the collective response that follows such incidents to be for everyone — including the victim — to behave as though nothing has happened, and carry on with no acknowledgment of the injustice that transpired. \nBut what if we all didn’t pretend to be unaffected and indifferent to such events? \nOn my own part, it would certainly make me feel less alienated to know that my friends and co-workers do not condone racialised hate or discrimination. \nRather than avoiding discussion of such incidents, tackling them directly opens up space for healthy and meaningful exchange of perspectives, enabling individuals from dominant and marginalised groups alike to confront their inhibitions and create a shared climate that is psychologically safe, whether in a professional or social setting. \nHere are three action points for supporting those negatively impacted by the use of racial slurs and other mistreatment. \nUpon witnessing the use of racial slurs towards members of one’s community or receiving racial slurs directly, the lack of intervention or action from others can often lead to members of under-represented groups feeling alienated or even betrayed. \nTherefore, it’s important for each of us to first educate ourselves on the experiences and challenges faced by marginalised groups (such as Malay Muslims and/or the LGBT+ community) routinely affected by racial slurs and other forms of hate speech. \nPractice empathy by asking yourself these simple questions: “How would I feel if someone spoke to me that way? What would I need from those around me in order to feel less alone?” \nSeeking out articles, podcasts or op-eds by members of marginalised communities can also help with perspective taking. These self-education efforts will help us to “model” supportive behaviours that centre victims in such incidents, rather than our personal sense of comfort. \nWell-intentioned individuals may wish to speak up, but may be incapacitated by the fear of saying something wrong or overstepping sensitive boundaries — “What if I offend them by bringing it up? What if not being a minority means that it’s not my place to speak up?” \nIn such scenarios, a simple acknowledgment of the incident would get the ball rolling.\nBy initiating the conversation and sharing feelings of vulnerability with friends and colleagues of different identities and backgrounds, we can encourage each other to face our inhibitions and to openly show support and empathy. \nIn any conversation regarding incidents of racial discrimination and hate speech, the focus should be on affirming the experiences and perspectives of our friends and co-workers from victimised communities, and showing respect and appreciation for them as valued members of society and the workplace. \nTrying to follow conventional tips and guidelines on what to say to friends and colleagues from marginalised groups can feel “fake” and contrived. “Is it weird if I ask ‘How are you’?” you may wonder. “Am I forcing it?” \nHence, it is very important that we be authentic in our interactions — that is, to present ourselves authentically and thoughtfully. But how do we do this?\nRather than worrying about what would be the “appropriate” language to use, focus on being open and genuine. Rather than striving to be right or wrong, strive to place the hurt individual’s perspective and needs at the forefront. \nWhen our words, thoughts, actions and non-verbal gestures are in sync with one another, we will be able to convey the message of solidarity and appreciation to our co-worker successfully. \nFinally, it’s critical to remember that each person may differ in their support needs. \nFor some, simple acknowledgment and reassurance may be enough; others may prefer to focus on work or other topics as a productive distraction or coping mechanism. \nSome may find an open conversation with their friends and colleagues more suitable, to help them navigate complex emotions and thoughts.\nPlacing the focus on those who have been hurt or negatively impacted ensures that we show support and allyship without being overbearing, and provide them the time and space they need to heal and restore. \nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nTania Nagpaul is a senior lecturer in the Human Resource Management Programme at the S R Nathan School of Human Development at the Singapore University of Social Sciences.

            "Article Body": "As more people are diagnosed with ADHD and other types of neurodivergence, recognition and understanding of their strengths and challenges can only be good for businesses in the long term, says this clinical psychologist. \n \nThere has been a rise in the number of people diagnosed with “neurodivergence” in adulthood over the past decade. \nAs many as 8 per cent of adults globally could have some form of neurodivergence.\nNeurodivergence is an umbrella term that typically includes autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and specific learning disorders (SLD) — sometimes referred to as dyslexia.\nThe rise in these diagnoses when people are already in the workforce presents a challenge for employers. Business owners can be left wondering how they can support neurodivergent employees without causing issues for the wider business.\nHistorically, diagnoses were predominantly made in children , with the view that people “grew out” of them as they developed into adults\nBut research over the past decade indicates the majority of people with these conditions continue to experience symptoms throughout their adult life, albeit in different ways to childhood.\nUnderstanding neurodivergence is underpinned by the view that ASD, ADHD, and SLD reflect differences in how a person’s brain is “wired” rather than being an underlying “disorder”.\nThis changing view appears to have increased awareness of neurodivergence. It has also reduced the stigma associated with it, leading more people to seek support as adults.\nA limited understanding of gender differences in the way neurodivergence is expressed, as well as limited access to psychological and psychiatric assessments in the public sector, have likely contributed to significant numbers of people missing out on childhood diagnoses. Many are now seeking assistance in adulthood.\nThis rising tide of adults seeking to better understand their differences — and potentially seek treatment — has presented challenges for businesses and employers.\nBut employers need not fear hiring those who are neurodivergent. Viewing neurodivergence as a difference rather than a disability contributes to an inclusive workplace where people’s strengths are recognised and celebrated.\nSome people with ADHD, for example, work very effectively in a fast-paced environment with tight deadlines and rapidly changing content, such as journalism.\nPeople with ASD often have very specialised areas of interest that, if matched to the right work environment, can lead them to be experts in their fields.\nBut it would be naive to say neurodivergence doesn’t bring with it some challenges for individuals and their workplaces.\nA person with ADHD may appear quite disorganised to others (and to themselves), and at times “put their foot in their mouth” through impulsively saying something they haven’t fully thought through.\nThose with ASD often report challenges in navigating social relationships at work, or may have particular sensory sensitivities (finding the general hubbub of open-plan offices anxiety-provoking, for example). They may struggle to process large amounts of written or verbal information, resulting in confusion and anxiety.\nBusinesses and organisations looking to support neurodivergence in the workplace should initially focus on increasing awareness and understanding among leaders and managers.\nManagers need to work with individual staff who have self-identified as neurodivergent to understand and implement what is needed to support them.\nThere may be some very practical steps that can be taken, such as having designated low-stimulus areas, providing noise-cancelling headphones, or understanding how best to communicate clearly and simply with an individual. Some staff may wish to take up psychological support via their workplace to help them develop skills in areas they find difficult.\nPerhaps the worst thing an employer can do is overlook neurodivergence as being present in the workplace. Ignorance, whether wilful or not, will lead to inaction.\nThat said, it would also be a mistake for an employer to unilaterally refer a staff member for an assessment of suspected neurodivergence. To suggest someone is neurodivergent and requires a psychological assessment may lead to personal distress and potentially breach employment law.\nEmployers should also be aware of the lengthy and complicated pathway to an adult diagnosis, due to factors such as lack of clear adult diagnostic criteria and shortage of trained clinicians. They can support staff in this process by allowing flexibility in work hours to attend specialist appointments, or even funding access to assessments in the private sector.\nThe rise of awareness about neurodivergence mirrors the rise in awareness of mental health conditions in the workplace generally.\nAlthough this increased visibility can be confusing for some staff and organisations, recognition and understanding of neurodivergence can only be good for businesses in the long term.\nHelping people operate to their full potential by understanding their strengths and challenges will ultimately lead to thriving and productive workplaces.

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "An economics expert asks: Is excessive competition impairing cooperation, making us collectively worse off? Or conversely, will a lack of competition blunt the drive for excellence and hinder progress?\nOver half (55 per cent) of workers in Singapore lack trusted relationships in the workplace, making them far more likely to report feelings of isolation than those with such relationships, reported health tech provider Telus Health in its Mental Health Index last month. Observers pointed to a competitive work environment as a contributor to isolation and burnout. \nAs Singapore strives to be a competitive nation, competition permeates workplaces, schools and every aspect of life. At the same time, we seek to build a more inclusive, caring and compassionate society, a vision that resonates strongly among Singaporeans, as revealed in last year’s Forward Singapore exercise.  \nAre these two objectives in tension, perhaps even inconsistent? Or can they be somehow reconciled? \nThese are questions particularly pertinent to young Singaporeans as they seek success and fulfilment in a fast-changing society. \nIs excessive competition impairing cooperation, making us collectively worse off? Or conversely, will a lack of competition blunt the drive for excellence and hinder progress? \nRather than view competition and collaboration as two ends of a continuum along which we must find an elusive equilibrium, it may be more useful to think about when competition is desirable and when it is more likely to be debilitating. This depends on the type and context of competition — specifically, whether competition enlarges or shrinks the collective pie.  \nThe competitiveness of Singapore’s school system has driven our students to excel academically, outperforming their peers in other countries.\nAt the same time, there is increasing recognition that an overly competitive, exam-focused system may take a toll on students’ mental health and self-confidence, and may even undermine the love for learning. The Ministry of Education has in recent years underscored that learning is “not a competition” — it should be about personal growth rather than relative positioning. Hence, the PSLE aggregate score has been replaced by broader achievements “bands”, while mid-year examinations have been scrapped at all primary and secondary levels.\nHowever, exams remain relevant both as a yardstick of progress as well as an objective means of allocating students to schools and courses. Some element of competition is unavoidable because of limited places in popular courses and institutions. \nIdeally, motivation to learn and improve should come from within, but it often takes a dose of extrinsic motivation to get students to apply themselves to the task.  \nCompetition is valuable when it spurs us to improve ourselves, but not when it is socially wasteful. For instance, a higher education “arms race” benefits no one if people chase qualifications not for better skills and knowledge but merely for prestige or to signal their ability to prospective employers. \nLikewise, there is a need for an appropriate blend of competition and cooperation in the workplace. \nEmployees vying for promotion and performance incentives are encouraged to give their best at work. However, competition taken too far undermines cooperation, which is necessary for the success of any department or organisation. \nWhile organisational culture and needs inform the intensity of competition among employees, good leadership can strengthen teamwork and collaboration so that a team is greater than the sum of its parts. \nWherever possible, we should seek win-win outcomes rather than zero-sum competition. \nSingapore’s tripartite collaboration among unions, employers and government is a case in point. Rather than just contend over the division of the pie, unions and employers work together to grow the pie through training and productivity efforts. \nSharing of gains and pain between workers and management during good times and bad helps to strengthen trust.  \nThere are instances, of course, where competition is the point in itself. Sports is one example of zero-sum competition that propels athletes to excel and generates thrills and spills for spectators. Still, sportsmanship is important, and players and supporters on both winning and losing sides can take satisfaction from a fairly contested, well-fought match.  \nIn politics, competition among political parties can improve government responsiveness and accountability to the public, but excessive partisanship can divide societies and render them dysfunctional. \nRespectful, constructive political competition — in short supply across the world today — is much needed for the future of governance in democratic states. \nFor a strong economy, competition among firms is a must for both efficiency and growth. A tenet of classical economics is that market competition, under the right circumstances, results in an efficient allocation of resources across society.   \nThe gains from competition are not limited to efficiency in the static sense; over time, competition can also spur innovation and progress. \nFirms may develop better products or services to steal a march on the competition, while scientific and technological rivalry could generate breakthroughs and innovations. \nAntitrust or competition laws are therefore critical to prevent firms from using market power to stifle competition or undermine the public interest.   \nHowever, competition may sometimes work against the interest of consumers. For instance, competitive bidding among local telcos for English Premier League broadcast rights led to higher costs for consumers, prompting the authorities to introduce the Cross-Carriage Measure in the pay TV market in 2011. \nThere are also clear benefits from cooperation among firms. For instance, firms may collaborate on training to build up skilled manpower for their industry. Shared facilities and resources can lower costs and improve productivity. \nThe government has also encouraged Singapore companies to “hunt as a pack” to seize market opportunities abroad.\nBeyond Singapore, there are strong indications that unbridled competition between nations states subtracts much more than it adds. \nGeopolitical rivalry is stoking tensions and undermining cooperation on common challenges such as climate change, transnational crime and disinformation. Trade restrictions, economic “decoupling” and technology bifurcation are already duplicating supply chains and shrinking the collective pie. \nAround 3,000 trade-restrictive measures were imposed around the world last year, nearly three times that in 2019. A report by the International Monetary Fund suggests that global economic fragmentation could cost the global economy up to 7 per cent of gross domestic product.   \nWithout effective international institutions to set limits on nation-states, perhaps other countervailing forces are needed — whether influential multinational corporations, global causes such as the climate agenda or other allegiances that can unite people across borders and temper the increasingly zero-sum competition among nations. \nA thoughtful recalibration of competition and collaboration is needed across the domains of school, work, industry and politics. \nSome forms of competition, such as those leading to greater effort and innovation, are clearly more beneficial to society than other forms. Competition should be recognised and even encouraged for the value it can bring — but where it becomes excessive or dysfunctional, it should be dialled back with appropriate laws, norms and nudges. \nWithin the community of nations, there is an urgent need for new models and mechanisms of cooperation. It will take leadership, innovation, and concrete trust-building measures to turn states from the path of debilitating rivalry towards peaceful coexistence and shared progress. \nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nTerence Ho is an associate professor in practice at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and the author of Governing Well: Reflections on Singapore and Beyond."

            "Article Body": "New research finds that music experience equips workers with a strong work ethic, willingness to learn, and the ability to take the initiative, says this senior lecturer in arts education.\nSee the word “musician” on a resume and you might not immediately think “stellar employee” or “exceptional leader”.\nPerhaps the word evokes the image of a rock star, in trouble for chucking a television out of a hotel room window. Or else someone struggling along in life, who should have picked a “real job”.\nBut is there more to the profession than meets the stereotype?\nIt is well known many musicians work simultaneously in arts and non-arts roles, often to create some income security. Less understood is just how well the extensive skillset developed in music transfers to a non-arts, professional workplace.\nMy nationwide survey sought to find out. I began by conducting 15 in-depth interviews with musicians simultaneously working dual-careers — one in music, and one somewhere else.\nThe preliminary findings, which are yet to be peer-reviewed, showed dual-career musicians have a plethora of distinctive workplace skills that had been enabled by their musical education and experience. This was verified by their non-musician co-workers.\nThe discovery sparked an ongoing second stage of research, investigating the experience of a larger group. These include:\nWith 165 respondents so far, the emerging results are significant: Music education and experience lays the foundation for high levels of future aptitude in a range of workplaces.\nOne of the most powerful traits instilled by a music education is a deep sense of professionalism. Eighty-five per cent of survey participants identified the trait as the skill that most influenced expectations of themselves and others, and the quality of their work.\nA common industry saying about rehearsal reflects this attitude of consistency and punctuality — “early is on time, on time is late, and late is left behind.”\nOther notable skills included autonomy and self-direction, resilience and perseverance, and creativity.\nParticipants attributed the development of these strengths to the disciplined and focused attention required to learn music, and the intrinsic motivation needed to practise and perfect an instrument over a long period of time.\nThis is increasingly relevant in an age where screens and social media steal our concentration and cost employers’ productivity.\nAnother key trait identified was creativity, which may reflect findings that the musically trained have more neuronal matter, and therefore increased brain activity.\nInterviews with non-musician colleagues showed that out-of-the-box thinking was particularly prevalent among jazz musicians, singer-songwriters and composers.\nParticipants unanimously said ensemble work — playing in bands, chamber music, orchestras and so on — has contributed positively to their workplace team dynamics.\nAs one respondent put it: \"It taught me how to be part of something bigger than myself.\"\nExperiences in music translated to a greater appreciation of diversity and inclusivity, exceptional leadership and deep listening skills, and the ability to manage “difficult” conversations respectfully within a team.\nRespondents said an ongoing passion for music improved their mental health and workplace resilience.\nUnsurprisingly, their non-musician co-workers reported better workplace morale and an infectious positive energy from their musical colleagues.\nAll respondents reported a healthy relationship with failure — experiences in music had taught them to remain curious, embrace learning and “fail forward” while owning errors.\nThis attitude directly enhances one’s ability to upskill in a non-music careers, something many respondents have had to do. Eighty-two per cent of the exited and dual-career musicians had re-accredited, and 71 per cent admitted to “learning on the job”.\nTheir live performance experiences cemented their ability to work under pressure in a variety of situations — public presentations, deadlines, project management. To them it was a no-brainer: “The show must go on.”\nCo-workers’ perceptions further verified the musicians’ transferable skills, suggesting they possessed high professional values, a strong work ethic, high intelligence, willingness to learn, and the ability to take the initiative.\nSurvey respondents work in a much greater variety of fields than you might expect, including:\nMany also hold leadership positions.\nEconomically, these findings suggest having a musician on the books may be linked to increased productivity, innovation, and profitability.\nThe skills of the musically educated are relevant to far more than just the arts. Employers and recruiters need to respect and appreciate the professional contributions of the musically trained.\nBut the ongoing decline in school music programs and nominal music teacher training, as well as a shift in tertiary training focus to science, technology, engineering and mathematics at the expense of the arts, suggest we’re heading the wrong direction.\nIncluding a well-informed understanding of music skills in repositories such as National Skills Passport would be a big step forward. So would ensuring all school children have access to proper music education, and that school leavers are not discouraged from pursuing further music training.\nWho knows, when the next pandemic comes, it could be a musician who designs the next life-saving vaccine.

            "Article Body": "In a sea of hot takes across the world wide web, what was it exactly about travel vlogger Nina Gerhards' that quickly became the talk of the town? A TODAY journalist puts forth this theory: It’s because when it comes to opinions about Singapore, we all care very much, whether we care to admit it or not. \nWhen are Singaporeans at their most patriotic? \nNo, not on the 9th of August. It’s anytime a non-Singaporean has the gall to make a bad comment about our country. \nRecently, a travel vlogger named Nina Gerhards posted an Instagram reel lamenting that our precious clean, green city-state was boring, and that she would never travel here again. \nMs Gerhards’ video clocked in at barely three seconds in length, and she didn’t speak a word in it. Instead, she offered only a caption of slightly under 100 words (and eight #hashtags) as elaboration, before inviting her fellow netizens to join her in the comments for a good-natured discussion:\n“What do you think about Singapore?” \nBoy, did we take her up on that offer. \nIn a matter of days, the video racked up more than two million views and hundreds of comments — the most ‘liked’ of which was a cordial smattering of unpublishable expletives, coupled with a polite suggestion that she shouldn’t have come in the first place. \nClearly, our collective buttons had been pushed. \nMany Singaporeans leapt to defend our Little Red Dot with long, elaborate essays on the country’s merits (i.e., we’re safe and it’s easy to get around), and recommendations on where she could go to turn her unfavourable opinion on its head (i.e., anywhere but the well-trodden tourist spots). \nSome in the same camp voiced their displeasure with far less tact and far fewer words. With Singapore being an island almost 500 times smaller than our immediate neighbours, they derided, was she expecting mountains, rivers, and sprawling wildlife amidst vast green plains? \nOn the flip side, there was a substantial number of people who agreed with the vlogger. \nSingapore is boring, they declared. Singapore is expensive. Singapore is a lifeless concrete jungle. \nIt’s a country not too dissimilar to the image of a rich man’s soulless playground depicted in Hollywood flicks like Crazy Rich Asians, they said — that’s why so many of us eagerly await the holidays and our own travel adventures to escape the mundanity of a society that prioritises work over fun.\nWhile I understood both points of view, I couldn’t help but wonder why this seemingly innocuous post managed to spark such heavy and heated reactions.\nAs far as I can tell, Ms Gerhards wasn’t being nasty or disrespectful, nor was she deliberately trying to incite a riot (although whether the post was designed as clickbait is another matter). \nShe merely cited an opinion — and we see far more controversial and arguably crappy ones on the Internet every day. “Singapore is boring”: Haven’t we heard that before? \nPerhaps the most grievous accusation the vlogger made that both camps wouldn’t have been happy with was that our food “wasn’t even delicious”.\nBut even then, going off her social media pages, Ms Gerhards is German. Someone born and raised on the other side of the globe having a different cuisine preference is hardly a cardinal sin. \nSo, in a sea of hot takes across the world wide web, what was it exactly about this one that quickly became the talk of the town?\nI think the answer has been staring us straight in the face: It’s because when it comes to opinions about Singapore, we all care very much, whether we care to admit it or not. \nWhether you think “Singapore’s great” or you’re firmly on team “Singapore sucks”, we inherently and instinctively know more about our country than a visitor on a three-day visa does. \nThe post going viral in and of itself isn’t necessarily a bad thing. The fact that so many of us jumped so heartily into the fray — either to highlight our strengths or to point out our weaknesses — just means we’re passionate. \nWhat I do find problematic is lack of civility in the town square of public reactions. \nWhen we resort to pointed personal attacks, does that not only serve to drive home the message that we are not a welcoming bunch?\nWhat does it say about us when our hostility — not always so thinly veiled — results in her feeling a need to turn off her comments section? \nI get it: When you put any hint of an opinion out on the Internet, you should expect to get flamed, cancelled, and everything in between. If you can’t take it, don’t dish it out. \nBut when it comes to a post talking explicitly about Singapore and its merits and demerits, do we really want to perpetuate a culture of reactionary resentment?\nThe urge to rush to defend that which we love is only human nature. But in an era where opinions on social media sprout up more frequently and randomly than pimples on teenagers, perhaps it’s wise to leave some be, rather than poke at every single one. \nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nRenald Loh is a journalist at TODAY who previously worked in the education industry and graduated with a degree in social science from Singapore Management University."

            "Article Body": "Even though pets may have an overall positive effect on mental health, it is possible that some of this benefit may be undermined if they are also causing you to lose sleep at night, says this assistant professor of psychology.\nSleeping with your dog in the same room could be negatively affecting your sleep quality, according to my team’s recently published research in Scientific Reports.\nWe recruited a nationally representative sample of more than 1,500 American adults who completed questionnaires assessing their sleep habits.\nOverall, about half of the participants reported co-sleeping with pets — defined in our study as sleeping in the same room with your pet for at least part of the night.\nNext, our research team compared the sleep habits of people who did and didn’t co-sleep with pets.\nOur analyses revealed that participants who co-slept with pets had poorer sleep quality and more insomnia symptoms than those who did not.\nThese findings persisted even after accounting for demographic differences between these groups. When considering pet type, we found evidence for a negative effect on sleep when co-sleeping with dogs but no evidence for a negative effect on sleep when co-sleeping with cats.\nSurprisingly, 93 per cent of people in our study who co-slept with their pets believed that their pets had either a positive or neutral overall effect on their sleep.\nAlthough more research is needed, these findings could suggest that most people are unaware of the potential negative effects their pets may have on their sleep.\nMost pet owners report that their pets have a generally positive effect on their mental health.\nPets can improve their owners’ health in numerous ways during the day, such as by encouraging physical activity, promoting a daily routine and providing love and companionship.\nHowever, our study fills an important knowledge gap by indicating that co-sleeping with pets can affect sleep quality.\nGood sleep is a pillar of health and wellness. Even though pets may have an overall positive effect on mental health, it is possible that some of this benefit may be undermined if they are also causing you to lose sleep at night.\nAlthough some people report that co-sleeping with their pets can provide them with a sense of comfort or intimacy, it is important for people sharing a bedroom with their pets to be aware of their potential to serve as a source of nighttime noise, heat or movement that can disrupt your ability to fall or stay asleep.\nSurvey-based studies like ours are unable to prove that co-sleeping with pets causes disrupted sleep, although there is some evidence suggesting that this could be the case.\nOne important factor that our study did not assess was whether participants were also co-sleeping with other people like a spouse or child.\nPrevious research suggests that sharing a bed with other people can also affect our sleep and that the mental health benefits of pet ownership could be stronger for people with a romantic partner.\nIt probably isn’t realistic for most people to just stop co-sleeping with their pets. So, what should someone do to improve their sleep if they already share a bed with their pets?\nSome expert tips include choosing a mattress that is large enough for you and your pets, washing and changing your bedding regularly, and establishing and maintaining a consistent bedtime routine with your pets.\nFurther research is needed to identify more specific habits and routines that pet owners can adopt to ensure a good night’s sleep when sharing the bedroom with their pets.

            "Article Body": "People can't seem to agree on whether the passenger's request was an overstepping of customer bounds or not. But even so, the job of a private-hire driver is to render a service to customers. This TODAY senior journalist asks: When it comes to customer service, is basic courtesy not one of the most essential things? \nLast week, a conversation between a private-hire driver and his passenger set off a storm of debate on acceptable behaviour between drivers and their customers.\nIn the shared screenshot, the passenger requested that the driver drive up to the sixth-floor carpark of their pick-up venue without specifying why. \nThen the conversation shifted gears with the driver’s reply: “U handicapped uh?? Go up lvl extra $5 wrong pick up.” The passenger promptly yielded and said they would head down to the pick-up spot. \nEnd of conversation? Not quite. \n“Don’t be self entitle,” tacked on the driver. “We r not your personal driver.” \nThe incident revved up heated responses from the public, which were largely split into two opposing sides: Those who agreed with the driver and found satisfaction in his response, and those who said the passenger was not wrong to ask and that the driver could have worded his reply more politely. \nIt’s clear that many in the first camp of opinion are themselves aggrieved private-hire drivers who have met their fair share of demanding passengers. A few comments pointed out that the driver was simply expressing the voices of his peers. \nPassengers these days are only getting more demanding, and their requests are more unreasonable, they griped. \nRiders should follow the pick-up rules, they chastised, and stop pushing your luck with overtaxed drivers to go the extra mile for you. \nPerhaps they do have a point. After all, there have been several instances of out-of-pocket requests from ride-hailing passengers, such as taking a detour to avoid ERP charges, that have made the news. \nKeeping in mind that publicised incidents such as these are likely just the tip of the iceberg, private-hire drivers in Singapore have good reason to be wary of passengers when they demand something out of the ordinary. \nMembers of the public who sided with the passenger stressed that it was not wrong for the passenger to make an auxiliary request, especially if it was already put forth early on during the booking process. \nNot everyone could agree on whether the passenger’s request was overstepping reasonable bounds or not — but even so, many disapproved of the driver’s tone as unnecessarily “rude”. \nIf he didn’t want to accommodate the request, he could have simply declined firmly but “nicely”, they said. \nWhen it comes to understanding each other, it seems like the driver and passenger in this incident were on different lanes. So who’s at fault? \nOn one hand, it’s true that some ride-hailing customers have gotten too used to taking a mile when drivers give them an inch. \nBut then again, is it fair to let a few rotten apples spoil the entire barrel? In the case of this incident, does the driver’s past experiences with vexing passengers warrant such aggressive treatment of all his future customers? \nPrivate-hire drivers, like any other service providers, are being hired to render a service to customers. And when it comes to customer service, is basic courtesy not one of the most essential things? \nHowever, passengers also need to keep in mind that while private-hire drivers offer us convenience and comfort, they are not at our beck and call. \nWe are customers on the benefiting end of a purchased service. The onus is on us to head to the pick-up point stated in the booking — because that is the agreement we’ve made in purchasing the service. \nOf course, sometimes we need a little extra help from our day-to-day service providers. Perhaps we’re dealing with an injury, or are travelling with a person whose mobility is significantly limited or impaired (an elderly relative, for example). \nIn such cases, it would be best to explain to the driver, clearly and politely, the need for a special request outside the standard parameters of the booking. \nThat being said, bear in mind that drivers have the right to decline such requests. \nIn response to queries from TODAY, Grab confirmed that customers are automatically charged extra fees for changes in drop-off locations, but not pick-up, as users are unable to change their pick-up locations once they have booked a ride.\nGojek stated that their app allows riders to change their pick-up location even after they’ve been matched with a driver with no additional fees, as long as the new location is within 200 metres from the original pick-up point and before the driver has reached the original pick-up location.\nIt’s not clear which ride-hailing platform this driver was operating on. However, this incident — like the ongoing debate on whether drivers should help passengers with their luggage — is yet another spotlight on the grey areas that remain in the modern age of ride-hailing services. \nWhat does “customer service” mean when drivers are no longer directly employed by a company? Does it still matter, or has the proliferation of app-based service purchases rendered such exchanges purely “business”, with no room left for human sentiment?\nIs it reasonable for drivers to overfocus on the financial benefit in their interactions with customers? Is it acceptable for passengers to put the squeeze on drivers in an attempt to get the most bang for their buck?\nUntil we have the answers to these questions, this incident drives home the point that politeness is not just free, but priceless. \nEither way, it’s probably safe to say that this particular driver won’t be getting five stars.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nAmanda Yeap is a senior journalist at TODAY who wishes we could all be a little more empathetic and kinder to one another. \n\nCLARIFICATION: Grab has clarified that for changes in drop-off locations made by the customer after booking a ride, the additional charge is automatically reflected in the app. As for changes in pick-up locations, drivers are not allowed to ask for any additional charges, but they have the right to decline requests if they are unable to fulfill them.

            "Article Body": "Here in Singapore, subtle forms of discrimination still abound in day-to-day conversations and colloquialisms — not because of malicious intent, but because of thoughtlessness, explains a communications strategist.\nMulticulturalism is largely celebrated in Singapore as a cornerstone of our society. However, discrimination still rears its ugly head from time to time, often in ways we may not even be aware of.\nOn March 15, reports emerged of a photo shared on social media by a Singapore Armed Forces serviceman showing the user participating in military training with his peers. In his post, the serviceman used a caption that contained a derogatory racial term. \nWhile the Ministry of Defence was swift to condemn the act, the damage was already done — netizens took to online platforms to criticise the boys for their insensitivity.\nBut some others were dismissive of or confused about the perceived “discrimination”, not understanding why the servicemen’s actions were harmful at all.\nI was recently at a client meeting where the conversation shifted into a mix of English and Mandarin, primarily from the Mandarin speakers in the room, who made up the majority. \nBeing Chinese, I could follow along just fine — but I could clearly see how it was a struggle for colleagues in the minority, left scrambling to play catch-up in an already fast-paced discussion. \nLike many other cosmopolitan cities, Singapore is a melting pot of differing cultures, languages and ethnicities. However, in any such pot, the reality is that the dominant culture often takes precedence. \nOftentimes, this dominance isn’t active or overt, nor is it forcefully enacted. Rather, it’s most commonly expressed in thoughtlessness — and this shows itself to be true even in everyday conversations and colloquialisms. \nWe’ve likely witnessed or been part of similar occurrences in our everyday interactions, where dialect phrases and other non-English streams of speech are naturally slipped in without consideration of the other parties present. \nAnother common example of inadvertent offence is backhanded compliments, where positive statements are followed up with discriminatory caveats: “You’re pretty for someone of your race”, for example, or “You’re smart compared to most women”. \nSuch caveats imply that the quality being praised is unusual for someone by virtue of their race or gender. This both undermines them and reinforces negative stereotypes, and those on the receiving end often end up feeling invalidated or inferior.\nA 2022 joint survey by the Association of Women for Action and Research and Milieu Insight polled 1,000 respondents — nationally representative by age, gender and race — and found that in the past five years, around half of Singaporeans have experienced workplace discrimination.\nMore serious forms of discrimination encompass unfair company policies and discriminatory employment practices related to career progression, including performance appraisals and promotion. For instance, individuals may receive a poorer performance appraisal after disclosing pregnancy, disability, or health conditions.\nWhile subtle forms of discrimination might be done without malicious intent, it can pose a significant problem if left unchecked.\nIn the case of speaking in a different language, nuances and subtleties vital for understanding and relationship-building in and out of the workplace risk being lost in translation, leaving those in the minority feeling excluded or disadvantaged, both professionally and socially. \nJonathan Kuek, a mental health researcher at Total Wellness Initiative Singapore, emphasises the “profound impact” on one’s mental well-being: “Such ostracism may trigger a range of emotions, from anger to anxiety to depression, and could leave individuals feeling worthless and lacking confidence in themselves.”\nOur language choices also have the power to enforce unfair gender dynamics. \nDuring a discussion of an event’s dress code, a client’s male colleagues joked about turning up in their “birthday suit”.\nWhile this was met with scattered laughter, the meeting’s female participants’ chuckles seemed comparatively strained. Some exchanged uneasy glances. \nIn incidents such as these, women often feel pressured to refrain from voicing their discomfort, or even to adapt and adjust. McKinsey's 2023 Women in the Workplace report reveals that 78 per cent of women facing microaggressions at work engage in self-protective behaviours, such as modifying their speech or behaviour, in an attempt to blend in and forestall negative reactions. \nThis practice is called “code-switching”, explains psychologist Beverly Tatum — adjusting one’s appearance or behaviour to match perceived environmental expectations.\nDoing so is a means of finding common ground in environments that promote assimilation, but can be detrimental if it requires sacrificing one's identity, cautions Dr Tatum. \nThe brunt of this pressure to blend in falls disproportionately onto women and other minorities. It can be as small as changing your given name in order to assimilate into places where the majority of people don’t bother saying it right.\nLinguistic microaggressions such as these aren't isolated incidents, but commonplace experiences for minorities. They are not merely surface-level issues; they’re symptomatic of a deeper struggle for inclusion and belonging. \nSimply put: We’re stifling voices not by silencing them, but by being inconsiderate.\nWe must take proactive steps to educate ourselves and others to identify the subtle ways our language, jokes, and word choices can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and affect marginalised individuals and groups.\nIt's as easy as extending basic courtesy to those in the room — for instance, it doesn’t hurt to explain why we're using a certain language or to avoid using it altogether if some people won't understand.\nBad behaviour should always be called out.\nHowever, this does not mean enforcing “cancel culture” or aggressively blasting the person to their face or on public platforms such as social media.\nInstead, \"calling in\" may be more effective, suggests Roses of Peace’s Mohamed Irshad.\nThis means connecting with the person making such remarks in an empathetic manner: “Hey, I know you didn’t mean any harm in what you said earlier, but it made me uncomfortable. Can we talk about it?”\nIf we find ourselves witnessing microaggressions such as these, we should not remain silent bystanders.\nSpeak up more to redress the disparity and damage, especially when minorities may risk their well-being and safety by speaking up for themselves.\nIn ongoing discussions about Singapore's future, it’s clear that we as a society are making strides to become a more inclusive society. However, we still have holistic work to do in many areas.\nCreating a culture of mutual respect starts with us ensuring that, in whatever rooms and conversations we’re in, all voices are equally heard. \nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nNicole Chan is a communications strategist by trade, and a digital native by passion.

            "Article Body": "Making online spaces less anonymous makes it easier to hold individuals accountable for harmful actions and deter others from engaging in similar behaviour, says this law expert.\nOnline harassment has become a pervasive problem in Singapore. \nSuch acts of harassment include cyberbullying and doxxing — the act of revealing someone’s personal details or any other information that can identify them without their consent, such as their name, residential address, email address, phone number, or photograph. \nIn the physical world, people are deterred from assaulting others due to the fear of severe legal consequences, such as lengthy imprisonment and even caning. However, the same cannot be said for those who doxx and cyberbully. \nDespite the lack of formal case reporting, informal platforms including Reddit threads such as r/SingaporeRaw provide glimpses at the negative impacts of such harmful behaviour, including emotional distress and reputational damage. \nThere have also been multiple instances reported of cyberbullying victims driven to suicide — both ordinary, everyday folk as well as celebrities such as K-pop stars Sulli and Kim Jonghyun. \nIn response to growing concerns, doxxing was included as an offence under the Protection from Harassment Act (Poha) from Jan 1, 2020. \nWhile the Act has offered some recourse for victims since its enactment in 2014, certain areas require further strengthening to effectively combat more forms of online harassment.\nCurrently, most popular platforms, such as Google, Facebook and Reddit have policies which allow victims to put in requests to remove content that harasses or doxxes others. \nNotwithstanding this, most social media platforms and online forums have complex terms of conditions and content moderation practices that could inadvertently protect the perpetrator at the expense of the victim. \nThis is because what legally constitutes doxxing is still a grey area — as such, these platforms reserve the right to draw and redraw the lines accordingly. \nLegislative enhancements could provide guidance on how platforms should handle situations where content moderation practices may inadvertently favour the perpetrator over the victim. \nSuch legislative enhancements could institutionalise a standardised framework that govern how online platforms should react to doxxing content, what they should do, and when they should take down offending content. \nAlthough reporting systems exist, platforms’ responsiveness to complaints can be inconsistent. \nEnhanced legislation could set out the timeframe in which platforms must acknowledge and take timely action to remove content that violates anti-doxxing policies. \nIn severe cases of online harassment that cross the line into criminal behaviour, legislation could require platforms to have clear protocols for escalating matters to law enforcement. \nThis would ensure a more integrated approach between platform-level content moderation and the legal system in the most serious cases.\nLegislative enhancements could also mandate that platforms take proactive measures to prevent doxxing, such as platforms detecting and blocking attempts to share private information without consent.\nPlatforms should also be required to err on the side of victim protection in ambiguous cases while still providing appropriate appeal mechanisms for accused perpetrators.\nVictims must be required to provide identity documents to prove that they are indeed the affected individuals when submitting a takedown request, in order to ensure it is a legitimate request. \nThe victim should state clearly how the post doxxes them by providing illustrations of how their names, identities, photographs, and other personal information are mentioned. \nIt should also be made mandatory for all platforms that has a nexus to Singapore (such as a pool of Singapore-based users) to collect users’ mobile phone numbers during account registration. \nIn today’s context, mobile phone numbers would be easily traceable to a user. \nCurrently, many online platforms, such as Quora, Reddit and HardwareZone allow users to remain pseudonymous.\nIn 2016, the University of Queensland’s David M Douglas noted that “de-anonymisation might be justified as a means of limiting or stopping such hate speech by increasing the speaker’s accountability”. \nThis means that perpetrators of harassment would not only be more inclined to take down an offending post if their cloaks of anonymity are removed — they may even think twice before harassing others at all. \nIdentification also makes it easier for victims to take legal action, if necessary, against perpetrators.\nHowever, once perpetrators’ identities have been privately revealed to victims for the purpose of seeking appropriate recourse, victims should in turn be placed under similar obligations not to publicly expose these identities.\nMaking online spaces less anonymous and more transparent also makes it easier to hold individuals accountable for harmful actions and deter others from engaging in similar behaviour.\nPoha criminalises various forms of harassment, both online and offline. \nIt empowers the court to issue protection orders and expedited protection orders to stop the harassment and remove related content. \nWhile the Protection from Harassment Court aims to make it easier for victims to obtain remedies under Poha, this still involves legal proceedings and victims need to navigate the court process. \nClaimants who are unfamiliar with legal terminologies, processes or documentation would likely need to engage a lawyer. \nThe idea of new legislative enhancements enabling victims to directly request takedowns of doxxing content from platforms based on pre-defined guidelines, without needing to go through the courts, could potentially fill the gap. \nNaturally, exceptions would have to be carved out to allow media outlets to report on news.\nAs things stand, without a court order, it is entirely at online platforms’ discretion to accede to or reject requests from victims of doxxing to take down offending posts or to de-anonymise perpetrators. \nVictims could spend much time and effort wrangling with these platforms in order to remove the offending information. \nIn these cases where the perceived lack of cooperation from online platforms allows perpetrators to avoid any consequences, victims have no other recourse but to give up and resign to their fates. \nMany victims end up exiting such platforms altogether, thus enabling and emboldening perpetrators to continue harassing others.  \nEnhancing self-help mechanism allows for early intervention and removes the hassle and trepidation of having to go through the court system. \nThe cost to the online platform of removing an offending post upon receiving a complaint is negligible. \nOn the other hand, requiring law enforcement to investigate and then request that the platform take down an offending post is a significant cost to society. \nSome critics argue that giving victims the power to request that online platforms remove harmful posts is a curtailment of the freedom of expression — but these naysayers fail to understand the very essence of such freedoms. \nNetizens who harass others to silence them and push them off online platforms and social media are the biggest impediment to freedom of expression. \nDoxxing on the pretext of individual vigilantism, while often motivated by a desire for justice or retribution, has no place in a well-functioning legal system. \nEmpowering victims is the key to stop and prevent doxxing and cyberbullying. Improved self-help mechanisms would build upon, rather than duplicate, existing platform policies, thus helping to foster a more respectful and safer online community. \nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nBen Chester Cheong is a law lecturer at Singapore University of Social Sciences, lawyer at RHTLaw Asia LLP, and doctoral researcher at the University of Cambridge.

            "Article Body": "Despite appearances, the physical business card isn't dead yet, says the author — and, strange as it seems, young people are among those who might find them the most useful of all.\nHave you ever met someone, been handed a business card, and found yourself without one to hand back?\nPerhaps you offered an alternative, saying “let’s connect on LinkedIn”, or displayed a scannable QR code on your phone that linked to your details, or offered to send a text or email.\nPerhaps you thought cards were no longer needed. You might not be right, at least not for all people, in all situations.\nAnd, strange as it seems, young people are among those who might find them the most useful of all.\nMy own informal survey of 61 contacts on LinkedIn found that more than half used both business cards and LinkedIn for introductions, and another 11 per cent said they used cards only, with only a little over a third eschewing cards altogether.\nAnd business cards are continuing in surprising forms.\nSome use QR codes to link to very detailed information. Others create contextual information and link users via video.\nSome are paywave-style cards that can be tapped, transferring information to the recipient’s phone. An Australian firm, Tapt, is one of the pioneers.\nSome send 10-second distributable videos.\nOld-school cards are most used by older networkers.\nSix in every ten LinkedIn users are aged 28 to 43, meaning they are millennials. While they are less likely to carry cards than older age groups, there are good reasons why they should.\nTo get ahead, it’s important to connect with supervisors and potential employers from other firms.\nWhether just added to a pile or kept in a wallet, a card is a sign that the person whose name is on it genuinely wants to reach out.\nThe design can say something about the owner’s professional identity, conveying values, aesthetic sense and distinctiveness.\nUnlike an email address scribbled on a Post-It note, a well-designed business card can convey a personal brand.\nAnd the mere act of handing over a card can build a bridge, ensuring that a meeting remains memorable.\nAt times when time is of the essence, such as in an elevator pitch, cards can offer a swift and efficient medium for exchanging quite a lot of information.\nAnd they are likely to hang around, reminding the recipient of the meeting, all the more so the rarer they become.\nThey are not for everyone, but for quite a while yet they are likely to be for people seriously trying to reach out.

            "Article Body": "The authors have been teaching a science of happiness course since 2019 where they create opportunities for students to put lessons from positive psychology into practice. What are the outcomes and what have the authors themselves learned?\nWhen you deliver a university course that makes students happier, everybody wants to know what the secret is.\nWhat are your tips? What are your top ten recommendations? These are the most asked questions, as if there is some quick, surefire path to happiness.\nThe problem is that there are no life-transforming discoveries, because most of what works has already been talked about.\nSocial connection, mindfulness, gratitude letters, acts of kindness, going for a walk in nature, sleep hygiene, limiting social media use.\nThese are some of the 80 or so psychological interventions which have been shown to work to improve our wellbeing (to a lesser or greater extent).\nBut if we already know so much about what works, then why are we still fielding requests for top happiness tips?\nThe data tells us that students and young people today are increasingly unhappy, with national surveys finding wellbeing is lowest among the young in the United Kingdom and the United States compared to other age groups.\nIt was for this reason we began teaching the science of happiness course at the University of Bristol in 2019 — to counter some worrying downward trends.\nDuring the course, we teach lessons from positive psychology and create opportunities for students to put these lessons into practice.\nWe award credit based on engagement — an important component of not only education, but also getting the most out of life — rather than graded assessments.\nIt would be ironic to talk about the problems of performance anxiety and student perfectionism only to then give our students a graded exam.\nCourse credit without examination? That must be a breeze you might say.\nHowever, for many students, turning up on time to over 80 per cent of lectures and tutorials, completing journal entries on a weekly basis and submitting a final group project turned out to be more of a challenge than they predicted.\nAround 5 per cent of students fail to meet the course demands each year, and have to complete a reassessment in the summer. Creating consistent positive habits in the face of all of life’s other demands is not a trivial request.\nNevertheless, the science of happiness course is extraordinarily popular. It also appears to be effective.\nEvery year we find increases of around 10-15 per cent on measures of students’ mental wellbeing at the end of the course, compared to a waiting-list control group.\nHowever, we recently published the findings from a study that followed up with students one to two years after they had taken the science of happiness course, before they graduated.\nWhen we looked at the overall trends, students’ initially elevated scores of happiness had largely returned to their original levels.\nWe were not dejected, though.\nOne of the mechanisms we teach on the course is hedonic adaptation: We get used to both good and bad things.\nSince humans have a brain wired to pay extra attention to problems, it comes as no surprise that the initial wellbeing boost we created in the course disappeared as students returned to focusing on life’s hassles.\nHowever, we observed that not all students followed this pattern.\nApproximately half the cohort reported that they continued to regularly practise some of the things they had learnt, such as gratitude or mindfulness, many months or years after completing the course.\nAlthough the students who no longer practised the activities returned to their happiness baselines, on average, those who did keep up with at least some of the recommended activities showed no such drop.\nThey maintained their elevated levels of wellbeing up to two years later.\nIn many ways, mental health is no different from physical health.\nFew people expect to see long-lasting muscle gains after one trip to the gym.\nFor the most part, we are begrudgingly aware that there are no shortcuts if you want to remain fit and healthy. You have to stick with the programme.\nThe same applies to our happiness. Unless we keep working at it, the improvements are temporary.\nIndeed, if we did have to focus on just one top tip it might be to learn how to harness lessons from psychology to build the better habits we need for lasting change.\nFor example, aiming for small incremental changes rather than an unsustainable overhaul of your whole life.\nOne thing we question is whether the self-care industry may be sending out the wrong message by telling people happiness is all about making yourself feel better.\nOne of us, Bruce Hood, writes in his new book, that becoming a happier person in the long term is less to do with focusing on ourselves, and much more to do with focusing on others.\nSelf-care may bring some short-term benefits, but enriching the lives of others can offer wellbeing effects that are less susceptible to adaptation over time.\nUltimately, whatever methods or activities we choose to improve our wellbeing, we would do well to remember that happiness is always a work in progress. THE CONVERSATION\n\nABOUT THE AUTHORS:\nSarah Jelbert is a lecturer in psychology at the University of Bristol, where Bruce Hood is a professor of developmental psychology in society. "

            "Article Body": "Why is employee empowerment important and how can companies, bosses and workers better embrace it? This Nanyang Technological University management expert shares his insights.\nThe pace of change in our modern workplace is accelerating. \nDriven by forces of technological change, digitalisation, societal and demographic shifts, and blurring lines between work and personal domains, such sweeping transformation poses significant challenges for employers and workers alike. \nDifficult questions that need to be addressed in these challenges include: How do we motivate people in jobs where routine tasks are quickly being taken over by algorithms or robots that operate many times faster than humans while making fewer mistakes? \nHow do we manage a workforce that will be more inclusive and diverse than ever before? \nHow do we engage workers who are faced with increasing conflicting demands from both work and personal demands? \nHow do we develop and maintain a culture of cohesion and collaboration among a dispersed workforce where individuals can be more isolated than ever before?\nThe concept of employee empowerment has been practised in management for almost six decades since the 1970s and used today by an estimated 80 per cent of organisations in some shape or form. \nYet companies and their managers still struggle to realise its potential, viewing it as a risky and time-consuming exercise, and unwilling to give up their power and authority. \nSuch a mindset is unfortunate. \nEmpowerment, when implemented properly, can still be an effective practice for organisations and their workforce to cope with and even thrive amid the challenges highlighted above. \nWhat exactly does empowerment entail? \nMost associate it with a set of structures and policies aimed at decentralising power and authority so that individual workers are able to proactively take charge and respond to the requirements of their job. \nHowever, perhaps an even more important aspect of empowerment is psychological in nature, where the individual intrinsically experiences motivation to take control of one’s work. \nSuch experience manifests in the increased meaningfulness experienced on the job, a self-deterministic attitude that one’s actions are totally, solely determined by their choices, competence felt towards one’s ability to successfully perform the work, and a belief that one can impact significant outcomes in the organisation. \nThis focus on worker psychology suggests that simply providing empowerment in terms of structure and policy is insufficient to bring about any real impact at the workplace. \nSuch an approach will likely falter in the face of the technological and societal challenges that increasingly characterise modern workplaces. \nFirst, employers should put in place a talent management system that encourages information sharing, participation, and continuous learning. \nTechnologies that can be particularly helpful are electronic bulletin boards and collaborative platform tools — solutions that facilitate both synchronous and asynchronous idea generation and feedback giving.\nIn order to help workers reskill and upskill, multiple career advancement pathways should also be provided, complemented by access to formal and informal learning opportunities in the form of training and the ability to collaborate with teams outside of one’s specialisation. \nFurthermore, financial incentives and recognition awards need to be tied closely to contributions that add value to the company’s business and customers. \nThis can take the form of relatively simple gestures. For example, Airbnb encourages managers to handwrite notes and holds pop-up celebrations of outstanding performance, while Google’s “Peer Bonus” system facilitates peer recognition through personalised messages on a shared internal platform that can even be accompanied with cash bonuses.  \nSecond, special attention should be paid to providing supervisors the support and tools they need to reinforce the empowerment of their subordinates. \nSupervisors must be trained to develop trusting relationships with employees who now have unprecedented autonomy and control over how they accomplish their work objectives. \nThey play an especially critical role in sense-making for their less experienced subordinates, providing clarity on organisational goals and initiatives so that workers can visualise how their work contributes towards the overall business and its competitive advantage. \nSupervisors must also be assured enough to allow and even encourage employee participation in decision-making that has meaningful impact on team and business bottom lines. \nFor instance, informal jam sessions involving employees and their supervisors across departments can not only boost participation, but also be fertile settings for creative ideas that drive innovation.\nConstant and constructive feedback that forms the base of mentorship and role-modelling in work relationships should also be embraced as a key part of the organisational routine.\nThird, any endeavours at employee empowerment are also best supported by an employee-centric culture. \nEmployers will need to expand their current workforce goals that are geared towards productivity and quality to adopting a more holistic view of employee well-being as an organisational mandate. \nThis should go beyond simply providing material resources that are required to complete work-related tasks, to also showing consideration for employees physical and mental health, as well as social needs and work-life balance. \nOnsite well-being workshops, flexible work arrangements, and even regular fitness challenges are good ways to demonstrate such commitment. \nOrganisations should intentionally work to encourage support networks among peers that not only serve to drive collaboration on work matters, but also act as safe spaces for emotional support and other resources dedicated to ensuring overall well-being. \nEach member should also be equipped with skills to provide basic support and mental health first aid to their colleagues. \nAt the same time, employee assistance programmes should offer employees access to avenues where they can seek appropriate professional help. \nFurthermore, structures also need to be put in place to ensure impartiality, transparency and consistency in decision-making, especially when it comes to the allocation of resources and distribution of rewards. \nEmployers also need to engage in the routine solicitation of employee input when key decisions are being made or in the planning of initiatives that can have strategic impact on the overall direction of the company. \nThis helps to build a trusting relationship between employers and their workforce, which in turn creates a healthy environment for employee empowerment to thrive.\nEmployers play a critical role in providing the above structures to drive empowerment — however, workers should not simply be passive recipients of such practices. \nEmployees need to take charge and engage in proactive career self-management by consistently learning and upskilling to ensure that their job-relevant skill sets are updated enough to take advantage of the opportunities that empowerment provides. \nIndividuals also need to be future-focused in asking how empowerment can bring about improvements to their job and stakeholders like the employer organisation, coworkers, customers, and suppliers. \nThey should also be proactive to engage in behaviours like scanning the job environment, feedback seeking, social-network building, which can all put them in a better position to utilise empowerment for the benefit of their jobs and employer. \nThe effectiveness of empowerment initiatives will be amplified when workers are proactive enough to take advantage of such opportunities.\nOverall, successful empowerment needs to go beyond formal changes and provisions in organisational structures and hierarchies. It needs to be supported by employer investments in talent management, supporting supervisory leadership, and employee well-being. \nIt also requires a workforce that is engaged and proactive enough to utilise empowerment for the betterment of their work. \nOnly then can the potential of empowerment be realised to help companies and their workforce deal with the technological, societal, and personal challenges evident in the modern workplace.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nKang Yang Trevor Yu is an associate professor in the Division of Leadership, Management & Organisation at the Nanyang Business School, Nanyang Technological University.

            "Article Body": "Extracurricular activities can provide a range of benefits but overscheduling too many activities can be harmful to your children. This Australian academic offers some tips to get the balance right.\nIt’s a weeknight, parents rush through the door from work, grab a snack, and then speed off in various directions to children’s extracurricular activities. As they do, they are managing tired and hungry kids as they all move from one thing to the next. Sound familiar?\nThere can be a lot of pressure to have your child in extracurricular activities, as this is seen as a way of giving them a rounded education and upbringing. And it can get expensive.\nHow do you get the balance right?\nExtracurricular activities can provide a range of benefits.\nStudies have shown extracurricular activities can help students academically.\nFor example, a 2011 study of United States high school students showed participation in extracurricular activities was linked with better results in maths.\nOther US studies have shown students who participate in extracurricular activities are more likely to complete a college (university) degree.\nResearch has shown extracurricular activities can help young people develop self belief, goal-setting, confidence and the ability to adapt to unfamiliar situations.\nIn turn, it can also help with mental health and emotional regulation. Team activities have especially been shown to reduce anxiety in already anxious kids, increase a sense of belonging and boost social awareness.\nYou may have heard media reporting about “oversheduling”. Too many activities can see children neglect their schoolwork and limit family time, which are also important parts of growing up. It can also have an impact on children’s sleep.\nHigh levels of sport in particular can lead to injuries and burnout.\nIt can also lead to “overtraining syndrome” where children don’t recover adequately from previous training or competitions.\nNot only does a child lose interest in the activity but their mood is linked to how well they perform. The activity can also come to dominate the family’s life.\nStart by working out as a family what is financially reasonable and how much time you can commit.\nThink about not just the game or lesson itself but any other regular training or practice that may be involved.\nLook at what your child is genuinely interested in, rather than what you feel they should do (as this just adds unnecessary pressure).\nYou could consider limiting children to one or two activities per week. This allows the child to focus on that activity and any training or practice that goes with it.\nBut there is no magic number of activities experts consider to be the “perfect” amount — each child is different. Some other factors you can consider are:\n\nChildren as young as two or three can benefit from extracurricular activities.\nAs they start to assert their independence, programmes in dance, sport or music can boost their ability to socialise with others, listen and get ready for school.\nThere are also benefits in starting extracurricular activities before the age of 10.\nResearch shows if you start before 10, children are more likely to stick with the activity for longer because it will become part of their identity.\nHaving said that, there is of course no issue with starting new activities after this age as children grow and develop new interests.

            "Article Body": "For ageing parents, child-provided social support may not always improve their quality of life, says this National University of Singapore author. Why is this so and what does it mean? \nSingapore is one of the fastest-ageing societies in the world. By 2030, one in four Singaporeans will be over 65 years of age. \nOne of the main concerns and challenges associated with an ageing population is how families can fulfil eldercare needs adequately, and the ways in which caregivers can be supported so that the care responsibilities are not too much to bear. \nThe Many Helping Hands approach has been pivotal in connecting voluntary welfare organisations, charities, and communities to support families that face difficulties in caring for their older members. \nRecently, more attention is also being paid to the challenges faced by family caregivers of seniors, persons living with mental health conditions or disabilities, and how the state and various organisations can provide more practical and emotional forms of support. \nHowever, within these ongoing conversations on caregiving for older family members, the views of the elderly themselves tend to be muted. There is less recognition of the extent to which older people find ways to address their own care needs, and how they try to avoid being a “burden” on family members. \nA study conducted by Lien Foundation and NTUC Income in 2016 with 998 participants who are mostly Singaporean between the ages of 35-75 years showed that 78 per cent of them preferred to live alone or with spouses in their own homes. \nLooking deeper into the care relations between older parents and their children, a 2022 study published in Social Science & Medicine notes that receiving financial support and assistance with housework from family members has the potential to reduce older adults’ sense of being in control of their lives. \nFor adult-children, providing such support is an expression of fulfilling a filial obligation — but for elderly parents, it may generate feelings of guilt and shame about being reliant on family members and lacking independence. \nFor ageing parents, child-provided social support may not always improve their quality of life.\nThis paradox signals the need to answer two complex and multifaceted questions: What type of intergenerational reciprocity is truly desired by older Singaporeans? What are the emotional aspects of care that we need to be more sensitive to?\nResearchers from the Department of Geography at the National University of Singapore (NUS) address this question through the context of families with at least one adult-child living overseas. Through in-depth interviews, the 2022 study revealed that failed expectations of care are rarely conveyed directly to children. \nFurther, most older Singaporeans participating in the study did not imagine a future where they would live with their adult-child, even if their healthcare needs should intensify. Instead, they envisioned a future with regular visits from their children, and direct or indirect forms of financial assistance (for example, funds with which to employ a domestic helper).\nWhile filial piety remains a cornerstone of Singapore society, we need to acknowledge that as citizens of a global city, certain groups of older people would be well educated and/or well travelled, giving them increased exposure to various ideas and types of intergenerational relations and dynamics. \nAs a result, many older Singaporeans may have developed perceptions about filial piety, intergenerational reciprocity, and their sense of independence which are not considered the traditional norm. \nThere are other factors that may contribute to this ideational change too, such as migration of adult-children, availability of foreign domestic workers and other forms of marketised eldercare — nursing homes, for example, or state policies on active ageing.\nAs such, there is a gradual trend where more Singaporeans are seeking ways to take care of themselves or live independently in their old age. \nOne way they are doing so is by delaying or decreasing their reliance on adult-children by living alone or with their spouse in smaller accommodations such as studio flats. Older people generally prefer to live in proximity to their adult-children, while co-residence with them is given much lesser preference. \nAnother way elderly Singaporeans are living independently is by seeking care beyond family.\nFor instance, a 2012 study funded by the National Council of Social Services and Singapore Tote Board on seniors who lived alone found that neighbours and friends — former colleagues, for example, or people befriended during social outings such as karaoke and group exercise events — are able to provide a vital form of support when needed. \nSuch examples include when going to see a doctor, doing necessary shopping, or carrying out various household work such as cleaning.\nBesides relying on social networks, some older Singaporeans are exploring more unconventional forms of care arrangements, such as co-living with other elderly individuals outside of their family and social circles. \nCNA in March 2023 reported that more seniors are turning to private companies to arrange assisted living for them; such arrangements typically include at least one co-resident (a fellow senior citizen) and a shared caregiver.\nLess “traditional” solutions such as these are shaping the future of Singapore’s eldercare landscape. \nIn this day and age, elderly people living separately from adult-children is not necessarily an indication of failing intergenerational relationships, but that older Singaporeans’ notions of intergenerational reciprocity and sense of independence are transforming. \nGiven these subtle and gradual ideational changes, what can be done to provide care that promotes ageing Singaporeans’ sense of well-being? \nBearing in mind that most older parents might not be comfortable or able to articulate their dissatisfactions, caregivers need to reflect and think more deeply about the underlying reasons for the type of eldercare they provide. \nAre we really addressing a specific need the older person has, or are we doing it because it is a social expectation? Can our well-intentioned acts of care unintentionally reduce the older person’s sense of independence and make them feel obligated to accept “help” they don’t want or need? \nThere is no one-size-fits-all answer nor a straightforward one. Yet, attentiveness to older persons’ subjective needs is a skill that both family members and various levels of care providers can develop to address this challenge. \nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nMenusha De Silva is a lecturer at the department of geography, National University of Singapore. Her research examines the intersections of transnational migration and ageing, as well as eldercare relations within transnational families."

            "Article Body": "Is Singapore’s work culture too demanding, or are today’s youths too soft? Either way, competing about who has it worse doesn’t help, says this TODAY journalist.\nWe’ve all vented about our workload to colleagues every now and then. \nOne might even argue that it is part of the bonding experience with fellow workers while in the proverbial trenches together. After all, misery loves company.\nBut take such rants to random strangers online, and be prepared to receive a lot less empathy or solidarity. You may even come out of it feeling worse.\nSuch was the case when a junior employee on March 17 took to online forum Reddit to express frustrations about Singapore’s work culture.\nHaving just started their first full-time job, they described their many struggles in coping with their new routine, including waking up at 5.45am each day to get to the office by 7.30am, long periods spent commuting amid rush hour, and finding themselves left with little time and energy to “do anything” after hours. \n“How am I supposed to get anything done or live this way for the next 40+ years of my life?” they asked. “Is this just the Singaporean way of life?”\nSome were immediately empathetic, agreeing that such a life is indeed unsustainable — even unacceptable. \nUnfortunately, this group conceded, it is a harsh reality that is difficult to escape from no matter how much they’d want to. Like that lor.\nOn the other hand, another faction of responders essentially told the Redditor to suck it up. \nThese netizens — likely of the older variety, seeing how they were more commonly found in the Facebook comment sections than on Reddit or Instagram — insisted that others had it much worse. \nOr how much longer hours they used to work ‘back in the day’. Or how much longer hours they still do today.\n“100 per cent confirm it’s the whiny Gen Zs,” read one dismissive comment referring to the original poster’s plight.\nIs the status quo in urgent need of a change?  Or should the workers of today roll over and silently accept their fate just because their forefathers did?\nRegardless, what the two camps of opinion implicitly agree upon is this: Generally, Singaporeans are spending a lot of time in the workplace.\nSure, our average number of work hours per week have marginally decreased over the years,  from 44.7 hours in 2017 to 44.3 in 2022, according to data from the Ministry of Manpower. \nWe might be working shorter hours than some economies (think China’s notoriously demanding 996 work culture — 9am to 9pm, six days a week). \nBut it is also a fact that we are still working longer hours than many other countries — the global average across developed countries is around 36 hours per week, reports the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.\nBut since we can all agree that we spend the bulk of our time working over anything else, why tear down those who express reasonable concern about the demands, expectations, and repercussions of such a culture?\nTo the older and more experienced among us who have had to slog for long hours and yet managed to create some semblance of a life outside work, kudos to you.\nSuch resilience is commendable. But at the same time, dismissing the concerns of younger ones new to the working world does little to help them. \nNeither does it do anything to heal one’s own unrealised or unresolved trauma from being worked to the bone and beyond by one’s employers or life circumstances.\nFor the younger ones, the apprehension and culture shock you may experience when adjusting to the new and sometimes brutal realities of the working world is definitely understandable and acceptable. \nHowever, it is true that many Singaporeans have figured (or are slowly figuring) out a way to find their own balance between work and other aspects of life.\nGive yourselves some time. With some experience, and a little luck, it is possible for each of us to discover our own tricks and hacks to eke out a similar balance.\nBottom line: As it is right now, a 44-hour work week is the card we are dealt with in Singapore. \nMore forgiving working hours in pursuit of a better quality of life is a worthy aspiration for many. Amid the many challenges at hand, including plunging birth rates and an ageing population, it may even be an ideal that all of society ought to strive towards. \nPost-Covid, the push for hybrid work and flexible hours have also set the wheels of change in motion, encouraging employers and employees alike to think outside the box of how many hours worked and when. \nEven so, considering how long it typically takes to make large-scale changes — providing financial support for the retrenched, for example — it might take a while to become reality.\nIn the meantime, it may be more worthwhile to refrain from turning public discussions on the subject into “Suffering Olympics” — a never-ending, ultimately unproductive competition of “Who has it worse?” At the end of the day, don’t we all deserve better? \nIn response to the Redditor’s original post, a small group of netizens chose not to compete but to offer sound counsel instead, chiming in with suggestions for reducing the job-starter’s commuting requirements and more.\nOne can always find company in misery — but surely it would be better to avoid misery altogether.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nTaufiq Zalizan is a senior journalist at TODAY covering the business, manpower, transport and court beats.

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "On Jan 11, 2024, Singapore and Malaysia commemorated a significant milestone in the construction of the Johor Bahru–Singapore Rapid Transport System (RTS) Link. The commemoration was followed by the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) for the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone (JS-SEZ). \nThese events were a follow-up to the 10th Annual Leaders’ Retreat in Singapore in October 2023.\nThe progress in bilateral ties points to the importance of strong commitment to ensure consistency and continuity in improving diplomatic relations. Such commitment will result in mutually beneficial gains for the economic growth of both countries.\nFor the Anwar administration, its commitment to deepen mutually beneficial cooperation with Singapore may be attributed to its priority of improving Malaysia’s economic performance, as this could help boost the unity government’s legitimacy. \nWith the Sultan of Johor as the current king of Malaysia and given the close economic ties between Johor and Singapore, the federal government is likely to further pursue bilateral cooperation with Singapore. \nThis is notwithstanding issues such as Pedra Branca and the shelved Malaysia-Singapore High Speed Rail (HSR) project.\nThe strong commitment of Singapore and Malaysia to strengthen bilateral relations was evident in a ceremony held at the site of the RTS Link Marine Viaduct along the Straits of Johor to mark the completion of the main connecting span in December 2023. \nDuring the ceremony, prime ministers Anwar Ibrahim and Lee Hsien Loong signed a commemorative plaque which symbolises the commitment to complete the RTS Link project.\nLikewise, the signing of the MOU on the JS-SEZ on the same day showed mutual commitment to deepening economic cooperation as the signing took place just two months after the 10th Annual Leaders’ Retreat. \nAlso, both governments have agreed to work towards a full-fledged agreement on the JS-SEZ and discuss the project at the 11th Annual Leaders’ Retreat in Malaysia later this year.\nMalaysia and Singapore are committed to ensuring the success of the RTS Link and the JS-SEZ projects as these endeavours will benefit the economies of both countries considerably. Indeed, the RTS Link, which is scheduled to start operations by the end of December 2026, is expected to enhance commuting between Singapore and Johor and boost businesses and tourism. The JS-SEZ will increase the cross-border flow of people and goods, improve the business environment, and strengthen the connectivity of both economies.\nSuccessive changes in Malaysian governments since the fall of the Barisan Nasional regime in the 2018 general elections had led to disruptions in the implementation of existing bilateral agreements, such as the shelved Malaysia-Singapore HSR project. However, Malaysia’s growing political stability since the 2022 general elections has been conducive to improved bilateral relations.\nThe ascension of Sultan Ibrahim Iskandar of Johor to the throne as the 17th Yang Di-Pertuan Agong (king) of Malaysia on Jan 31 may support the stability of the unity government and the continuity of its policies toward Singapore. \nIndeed, in his speech at the opening of the third session of the 15th parliament on Feb 26, Sultan Ibrahim warned against attempts to destabilise the political situation and undermine the unity government.\nNo doubt, as the Malaysian king, Sultan Ibrahim is obliged to remain above politics, including in the foreign policy arena. Nonetheless, he has been known to be significantly vocal about political affairs in Malaysia. Thus, Sultan Ibrahim, in his capacity as the Malaysian king, is likely to have some degree of influence over domestic politics and foreign policy.\nFor example, Sultan Ibrahim has played a prominent role in establishing good relations between Johor and Singapore. As the current king of Malaysia, Sultan Ibrahim is likely to continue to have a positive impact in bolstering not only Johor-Singapore relations, but also diplomatic ties between Singapore and Malaysia as a whole.\nAdditionally, Sultan Ibrahim has expressed support for Prime Minister Anwar, along with expectations for the latter to address major concerns such as growing Malaysia’s economy. \nThis support gives impetus for the Anwar administration to deepen bilateral ties with Singapore, not only to boost the economic performance of Malaysia but also to maintain good relations with Sultan Ibrahim, who wants cooperation with Singapore to benefit Johor economically.\nThere are concerns, no doubt, that bilateral issues such as maritime delimitation, water, and airspace could derail the recent progress in bilateral ties. So far, however, both countries have been able to manage these issues constructively.\nA case in point is the Pedra Branca issue. \nIn 2017, Malaysia had sought to apply for a review of the 2008 International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruling, which awarded sovereignty over Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks to Singapore and Malaysia, respectively, while concluding that “sovereignty over the South Ledge belongs to the State in whose territorial waters it lies”.\nBut the Pakatan Harapan government that took office a year later withdrew the application.\nIn January 2023, the Anwar government stated that Malaysia respected the 2008 ICJ ruling but found out, through a special task force, that the dropping of the application to review the ruling was “improper”.\nConsequently, a Royal Commission of Inquiry (RCI) was formed in January this year to examine the reasons for the withdrawal of the review application. However, the inquiry appears to be domestically oriented rather than targeted at Singapore per se.\nSpecifically, the RCI is focused on identifying those responsible for failing to handle the review application properly and enabling Malaysia to be better prepared to cope with similar sovereignty issues in the future. \nThe Singapore government considers the RCI an “internal matter of Malaysia” that would not undermine bilateral ties.\nMoreover, both countries have been working together on the Malaysia-Singapore Joint Technical Committee to implement the 2008 ICJ ruling on Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks, and South Ledge. This includes ongoing discussions concerning sovereignty over South Ledge.\nTwo implications could be inferred. \nFirst, the Anwar administration may be seeking to assure Malaysians that his country is addressing outstanding bilateral issues with Singapore, thereby improving the image and legitimacy of his unity government. \nSecond, the Anwar government remains committed to developing positive ties with Singapore while upholding Malaysia’s national interests.\nThus, Singapore-Malaysia relations can progress without major obstacles as long as there is a strong commitment to deepening cooperation involving constructive measures to manage long-standing bilateral issues. \nSuccessive governments following the short-lived Pakatan Harapan government under Dr Mahathir Mohamad have sought to grow bilateral ties. Singapore is headed for a leadership transition in the coming months, but its government’s commitment to bilateral relations is expected to remain strong.\nOverall, the positive developments in diplomatic ties over the past year have infused optimism for the upcoming 11th Annual Leaders’ Retreat in Malaysia and in the run-up to the commemoration of the 60th anniversary of diplomatic ties in 2025.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nDavid Han Guo Xiong is a research fellow with the Malaysia Programme at the S.

It is not mentioned if the car is brand new.\nFaris was shocked when he saw the figure on the cheque, to which his mum said: “It’s okay. Just take it.”\nThough Faris did not get straight As, Liana said the \"results were more than enough\" for her, and emphasised that his achievements were more significant than the gifts.\nFaris also shared the video on his socials, thanking his mum for being a constant pillar of support.\n“You were always there when I felt down and alone. Thank you for always praying for me,” he wrote.\n“My mum has given me everything and there is nothing I can do in return but make her smile,” Faris added.\nRecently, Liana also made the news after her house was broken into, losing around RM3.5mil (S$1mil) worth of jewellery and luxury items. Part of the loot was later recovered.\nLiana has since expressed a desire to relocate due to safety concerns.\nPhotos: lianarosli_official/Instagram, farisanakmama/Instagram"

Just take it from Chris.\n“5566 was so famous, we were all so jealous! You guys attended every charity event we held!” he exclaimed.\nA shy Tony then said: “Yes, it seems like we appeared at every important event at that time. We once held a fan meet at the Merlion, and to date, I believe we are the only ones who have done something like that. We performed at the area in front of the Merlion, and the fans queued way past the [Esplanade] bridge to get our autograph.”\n“It was really wild,” agreed Chris, who then asked: “How long was the group together before you guys decided to go solo?”\nTony explained: “We always had an arrangement where we would fly solo, but never disband. We would get together when there were jobs for us as 5566.”\nChris mentioned rumours of discord within the quartet, with reports claiming that the members didn’t get along.\nTony elaborated: \"Back then, we were only in our early 20s, and our boss planned everything for us. We were young, and worked towards a common goal. However, when you reach a certain age, there are things you want to do, and you start to realise the meaning of life. It really came down to our choices.\"\nHe then brought up former band mate, Sam Wang, who has sat out from the group’s activities since 2016. “I feel like that can also be attributed to choice. He felt like the things he wanted to do [were different] and he did not want to be with the rest of us anymore,” explained Tony.\nChris concurred: “You’ve all grown up, and it’s impossible that you guys still share the same dream. The things you want to do will change, and there’s no right or wrong to it.”\nWhen asked about the “low moments” in his career, Tony revealed: “It was when 5566 just ended (in 2008). During that time, all the jobs strangely stopped coming as well. I was left with a few ad hoc jobs.\"\nTony once said in an interview that he had used up all his savings in the three years after the group disbanded. His life hit another low following his much-publicised divorce with actress Angel Han in 2015.\nWhile he did not mention said difficulties during his conversation with Chris and Kym, Tony shared that it was only after he began hosting more shows that things started to get back on track.\nIn a behind-the-scenes interview, Tony revealed: “Many years ago, when we released our last album (in 2008), although we didn’t say we were disbanding, we had completely stopped our activities as a group.”\nThree of the group’s members —Tony, Zax Wang, and Jason Hsu — reunited in 2016 at the 51st Golden Bell Awards. They have since appeared as a trio on other programmes and held concerts in both Taipei and Singapore in 2019.\nTony continued: “It’s all thanks to our fans that we’ve been able to get together again, hold our concert, and record a new song. Plenty of time has passed but it feels like nothing much has changed.”\nPhotos: mewatch\nWatch the full episode of Dishing With Chris Lee on mewatch, or catch it below. "

            "Article Body": "Taiwanese actress Yao Yao has been accused of being a bad neighbour after she reportedly defaulted on her condo maintenance fees and inconvenienced the life of fellow residents.\nRecently, it was reported that the 33-year-old star had failed to pay a year's worth of maintenance fees, amounting to approximately NT$49K (S$2,055). \nAccording to reports, Yao Yao currently lives in a 20 sqm luxury apartment which she purchased for 15 million (S$630K) in Taipei's Xinyi District nine years ago.\nShe is required to pay NT$4,100 (S$172) for the building's maintenance every month, which she initially did.\nHowever, over time, Yao Yao fell behind on payments, even though they could easily be done through bank transfer.\nThe management had to repeatedly send her reminders before she would pay up, and the payments stopped entirely in May last year.\nAccording to reports, the management had issued many official reminders to the actress but to no avail.\nIt even applied for enforcement through the court last November, only for the legal document to be rejected by Yao Yao, resulting in the order becoming void as it was \"not served\" to the parties involved.\nThe management had no choice but to publicly call the actress out by placing a notice in the lift lobby.\nThe notice stated that a resident named \"Guo X Yao\" — Yao Yao's real name is Guo Shu Yao — had accumulated over a year's worth of unpaid maintenance fees, and has to pay NT$49K (S$2,055) within seven days or the management would once again seek enforcement through legal means.\nYao Yao only cleared her outstanding payments after seeing the notice. \nBut that was not the only issue the management had with the actress. \nYao Yao apparently also has a habit of purchasing stuff online but did not collect them when they were delivered.\nShe had left more than 10 big parcels in the lobby for nearly six months before retrieving them.  \nWhen the management posted public warnings asking her to remove her items, the actress was captured on CCTV taking the notices down and ripping them up.\nThe management later informed her that tearing the notices constitutes vandalism or mischief, and told her to remove her items before they took legal action. Only then did Yao Yao retrieve her packages.\nThe actress has since issued an apology for her behaviour. \nYao Yao explained that due to her busy work schedule and frequent travels, she had \"neglected to handle [her] daily affairs properly\". \n\"But that's not an excuse and I have reflected on myself and will settle this as soon as possible,\" she assured.\nYao Yao then promised to be accountable for herself in future and would ask her family to assist in paying her maintenance fees promptly. \n\"I'm really sorry for causing trouble to neighbours and the building's management committee,\" she said.

            "Article Body": "It isn’t easy being a hawker — adding to the struggle with long hours, laborious work and demanding customers, these food sellers also have to grapple with keeping food prices low amidst manpower shortages and ever-increasing rent hikes.\n\nThe stoic pioneer hawkers feel the pain, and the young hawkers, possibly even more so. Educated and ambitious with wide-ranging career opportunities, they chose to enter the hawker trade to continue their parents’ business legacy, or to fulfill a passion to work in the food industry. \n\nWhich is why one F&B boss decided to fund two millennial hawkers to open outlets and expand their businesses. Terence Aw, 39, runs the popular Aw’s Signature Minced Pork Noodle at Tanglin Halt Food Centre, and Eunice Seah, 38, is the third-generation owner of Yu Kee House of Braised Duck.\n\nTheir outlets are all located at a newly revamped coffeeshop at Blk 326 Woodlands St 32, which officially opened today (May 26).\n\nNo part of this story or photos can be reproduced without permission from 8days.sg.\nNow, you may have seen Yu Kee restaurants in malls, but those were opened by Eunice’s uncle. The famous family business, started by Eunice’s grandparents, split into two separately-run but same-named brands in the early 2000s. Eunice’s uncle branched out with his own chain bearing the same name, while her parents continued running the original biz.\n\nAccording to Eunice, her family are still on good terms, and simply stay in their own lanes with their respective businesses. Customers can also differentiate the two Yu Kee brands by noting one subtle detail: the mall staple Yu Kee has black staff uniforms, while the other mainly coffeeshop-based chain has green staff uniforms.\n\nWhile there are currently no definite plans to fund more young hawkers, Lem says it is still a possibility. “We will continue to work with young and passionate people,” he shares.\n\nAw’s Signature Minced Pork Noodle & Duck Generation3’s Woodland outlets are at Maxim Stars Coffeeshop, Blk 326 Woodlands St 32, S730326. Open daily 6am-7pm (Aw’s Signature) and 8am-9.30pm (Duck Generation3)."

            "Article Body": "It's been a hot minute since veteran actor Duan Weiming has starred in a Mediacorp Chinese drama, but the 63-year-old is making a comeback in the upcoming Hope Afloat. \nIn an interview with Chinese media Zaobao, Weiming revealed that he plays a wheelchair-bound father who lives with his daughter after his wife dies from Covid.\nThe drama also stars Chantalle Ng and Tasha Low, as well as Zhang Zetong, Tyler Ten and Desmond Ng.\nThough it's been really long since he starred in a Chinese drama — his last was 2015’s Tiger Mum — the actor proudly said that there was  \"no difficulty\" getting into character. \n\"I was just being myself. I also spoke Mandarin for the series, which made it very comfortable for me,\" he said. \nIn case you're wondering what he meant by \"being himself\", Weiming, who suffers from diabetes, is also wheelchair-bound in real life after having his left leg amputated in 2022.  \nPost-amputation, Weiming starred in English drama 128 Circle as drinks stall uncle Larry. In the show, Weiming wore a prosthetic limb. \nThe actor, who rose to fame after playing Ah Cai in '80s Mediacorp drama Neighbours, was also asked how he feels about the new generation of actors these days. \n\"They're smooth like a pond loach,\" he said sternly. \nHe added that they deliver their lines very well, but \"lack emotion\" and \"have no cadences or inflections in their voices\". \nWeiming said their efficiency in delivering their lines means there are very few no good takes and so they can end work early. However, after decades in the business, he knows that's not how acting is supposed to be like.\n\"Back when I was acting in Neighbours, I thought shooting 10 scenes in a day was a piece of cake and that acting was so easy. Thankfully, there were seniors like Ke Sha Fei and Cai Ping Kai who reminded me to not be so 'smooth' when acting,\" he recalled. \n\"It's important to not stutter, but we need to know when to pause and add layers to our performance.\"\nWeiming went on to share that he was supposed to act in a movie a while back, but he turned it down because of the pay. He was offered $1000 a day for a role that has no lines.\n\"I remember a conversation I had with late local actor Wang Sha. Back then, he asked me how much I charge for my getai performances, and I said I would quote them $500 for hosting. [Wang Sha] sighed: 'Silly child, if you only ask for $500 now, it would be very difficult for you to raise your price in the future. Even those with conscience will only pay you a little more',\" recalled Weiming. \nIt's why Weiming has learnt to value himself more. \n\"Since they are willing to approach me, it means I still have value. I don't have a manager so I need to fight for myself to be treated reasonably,\" he said. \nThis is perhaps also why Weiming, who's divorced and has two kids — a 37-year-old daughter and a 17-year-old son with his ex-wife — doesn't want his son to step into showbiz, though he was once approached to star in a drama.\nAccording to the actor, he rejected the offer for his son as he didn't want his son to enter the industry at such a young age.\nWhen he was told that his son looks exactly like him, Weiming laughed: \"He really resembled me when he was in secondary one or two. But now he's so fat, he's 100kg!\"\n\"If he stands in front of me, he can block me completely. I beg him to lose weight and exercise more! How can he be so fat at such a young age,\" he said. "

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "When she was just 21, Camelia Nguyen, now 29, made the bold decision to leave her comfy life in Vietnam to pursue a career in Singapore. Eight years later, she's the new owner of her own hawker stall, Yi Xin Yong Tau Foo, located in a quiet coffee shop within an office building at a Woodlands industrial park. It’s hard to miss her stall with its cutesy sign board featuring a cartoon drawing of its lady boss.\nNo part of this story or photos can be reproduced without permission from 8days.sg.\nCamelia came to Singapore in 2016, leaving behind her “comfortable middle class” lifestyle back home in Ho Chi Minh City. Unlike many who go overseas in search of a better future, Camelia’s family isn’t struggling. They own multiple plots of land which they’ve used to run businesses like karaoke lounges and minimarts. They also operate a seafood distribution business. \nBack home, she tells us that her family lives in a two-storey shophouse. They also have two other houses which they rent out as a secondary source of income. In Singapore, Camelia is renting a room in a three-room HDB flat. Compared to her life in Vietnam, the hawker says she has to work much harder now: “My life in Vietnam was more comfortable - I had hired staff who helped with all my work. But in Singapore, I have to do everything on my own,” she explains. \nSo, why leave Vietnam and her family’s business? She says: “I wanted to be independent, see my potential and try to make it on my own. I also knew some Vietnamese friends who were living in Singapore.” She adds that she chose to come to Singapore as it’s “safer for a girl” here.\nThe now Singapore PR shares that her mum was initially unhappy about her decision to relocate to Singapore: “My mum was worried about me going overseas alone, but now she is supportive,” she says. \nThe new hawker says: “I have no regrets moving to Singapore. To me, success is a journey, not a destination”. She adds that after eight years here, “I’ve just managed to do what I want - which is to open my own business, but I believe I’ll be able to do better and better in future”. \nShe declines to state on record whether she is single or attached. \nThough her family is doing well now, Camelia, whose dad left the family when she was young, notes that she wasn’t born with a silver spoon, as the Vietnam war had left them in poverty. “Since young, my mum had a lot of small businesses [in markets], and she would bring me along. Whatever she could sell to make money, she tried it,” Camelia shares. When she was five, she lived together with her brother and mother in a small rented bedroom, but as her mum often had to work late into the night, there were days that Camelia would fall asleep on the streets by her mum’s stall. \nLife only took a turn for the better when Camelia hit her teens: “In my teens, my mum started selling seafood at a market, and the business started making money. From there, she saved up and my home life got better”, she says. Her mum bought their first house when Camelia turned 18. \nThough she considers herself involved in her family business still, Camelia says her mum handles most of the operations now, since Camelia is in Singapore. She explains: “Whenever my mum wants to open a new biz, I will chip in some money. And when I needed money to open this business [in Singapore], she sent money from our business [in Vietnam]”. \nCamelia and Meyers\nCurrently, Camellia is the sole owner of her yong tau foo stall, though she works together with her business consultant, Meyers Wu, 35, who helps her with social media and operations. This is just a part-time hustle for Meyers, as he currently works in IT as a back-end application engineer. He decided to help Camelia, whom he met two years ago through mutual friends, as he felt that they have different strengths that could benefit Yi Xin Yong Tau Foo: “Each of us have our own forte - she’s better at operating the hawker stall, while I’m better at handling the back-end of the business,” he says. \nHe tells us that he isn’t a shareholder in the biz, though he will earn a portion of the profits once they recoup the investment.\nWhen the newbie hawker first moved here, she worked as a beautician doing nails and eyebrow threading for six years before entering the hawker biz. The Singapore PR explains that she “wanted to try something different, so I decided to switch to the F&B line to try and see if I can make it, since I like to cook”. \nShe decided to sell yong tau foo instead of the Vietnamese dishes that she’s more familiar with, simply because she wanted to cater to the local market. “A lot of customers ask why I’m Vietnamese but didn’t choose to open a pho stall. I’ll always say that I want to make food for Singaporeans - there are more locals than Vietnamese people here, and not a lot of Singaporeans know how to eat Vietnamese food,” she explains.\nWhy yong tau foo specifically? “Many young guys like to eat fried food, while many girls like to eat healthy food, and a yong tau foo stall has both of those things,” she reasons.  \nCamelia adds that the initial transition from a beautician to hawker job wasn’t easy: “When I first started, I felt that [being a hawker] was very tiring because I was used to being in an air-conditioned setting when I worked as a beautician. My legs and arms were all sore from working as a hawker, but now I’m used to it and think I can do it,” she says. \nLast year, Camelia spent nine months training at other yong tau foo hawker stalls, where she picked up basic cooking skills. However, she tells us that her recipes are entirely her own - in fact, her ex-colleagues were hesitant to teach her theirs. \n“My colleagues were not willing to teach me, because they thought that I wasn’t there just to earn money, but also to learn their recipe. So I had to secretly learn things on my own, and observe [my colleagues] to pick up basic things like how to cook the ingredients,” she shares. \nThe young hawker adds that she “wanted [her recipes] to be special”. Instead of using store-bought soup mixes which she says many other stalls do, she makes her laksa gravy and tom yum soup from scratch daily. Camelia also handmakes over 15 types of yong tau foo ingredients.\nIn total, Camelia invested around $22,000 into Yi Xin Yong Tau Foo. She hasn’t recouped her investment yet, but remains hopeful since it’s only been three months since opening. \nThe lack of footfall at their coffee shop is a problem, though. Meyers says: “People and traffic is where the main bulk of revenue comes in for F&B. In this area, I would say that it’ll take a while longer [to recoup the investment], so that’s why we have plans to open a second stall in a more prominent and accessible location”. \nThey chose to set up their first shop here as they wanted to target the office crowd in the surrounding buildings, and were also offered a lower rental fee of $2,500 a month.\nYi Xin Yong Tau Foo offers three soup bases: original, laksa and tom yum. There are over 40 toppings to choose from, and nine types of noodles, like kway teow, thick and regular bee hoon, mee suah, udon, or rice. Each soup comes with a minimum of one carb and six toppings, costing $5.50 for original soup, and $6.60 for laksa and tom yum. Additional toppings start at $0.80 each. \n8days.sg sampled three bowls of yong tau foo - original soup with yellow noodles, laksa with thick bee hoon, and tom yum with mee suah.\nFor our healthiest bowl, we paired our clear soup with beancurd skin, baby corn, carrots, and enoki mushroom, plus Camelia’s handmade stuffed tomatoes, red chilli, tau pok and wanton. The wholesome broth - made with chicken bones, veggies, yellow soybeans and ikan billis - was clean-tasting, with a slight sweetness from the dried fish. Camelia’s handmade toppings were lightly crispy and fried to a nice golden-brown without being too oily. Each ingredient was  generously stuffed with juicy minced chicken, which she mixes with chicken seasoning powder and eggs. The filling was still flavourful enough despite not containing any of the usual dried sole fish powder or salted fish.\nCamelia’s handmade YTF ingredients\nOur favourite bowl of the lot. The laksa here is rich and savoury, with a robust coconutty gravy that paired well with the smooth thick bee hoon. It’s more on the creamy than spicy side, so we recommend adding a dollop of the punchy housemade chilli for more kick. We had our bowl with mala-seasoned crumbed chicken, boiled egg and prawn balls. Though the toppings were nothing noteworthy, the sour-spicy mala chicken complemented the lemak laksa especially well.\nThe tom yum here was adequately spicy and tart. We enjoyed how the thin mee suah soaked up the piquant broth, making each mouthful extra shiok. We had ours with crispy fried fish belly, beancurd and broccoli, plus a platter of Camelia’s fried minced chicken-stuffed ingredients on the side.\nYi Xin Yong Tau Foo is at #01-30 Woodlands Horizon, 31 Woodlands Cl, S737855. Open Mon - Fri 8am - 7pm; Sat 12pm - 8pm. Closed on Sun.

Isn't it better if you just stick to acting?\" said the netizen. \nThe actress, however, chose to address the comment graciously. \n\"I really do look like [Sun Wukong]. Thank you for noticing me, but I've already tried my best. I like to dance and I'm there to learn and get out of my comfort zone,\" she replied.\nCheryl also said she's \"looking forward\" to any kind of guidance from others for her future performances. \nMany eventually came to her defense.\n\"We'll support you no matter what,\" assured a fan while another said: \"Cheryl is willing to try new things, I think that's great.

            "Article Body": "Hong Kong actress Zoey Sham, 37, has been living her best taitai life since marrying Malaysian tycoon Dixon Chin in 2012.\n\nShe and Dixon have two sons, aged nine and five. \nRecently, Zoey took to Instagram to complain about an incident that happened when she sent her son to an ‘interview class’, which is a course that seeks to improve a kid's speech and communication skills.\nAccording to Zoey, who is a quarter Thai, she had no make-up on when she dropped her son off for class.\nShe ran into an older lady with short hair who was not fluent in Cantonese. The  woman then ordered Zoey around, barking: “Jie Jie, you come here!”\nFor those who don’t know, domestic helpers in Hong Kong are addressed as ‘Jie Jie’, which means older sister.\n“Actually, I was not too offended by that. Perhaps my dressing really made me look like a domestic helper, and at times I have been mistaken for one when I  have no make-up on. It wasn’t weird, but I felt like the lady’s attitude was very bad,” said Zoey.\nZoey then asked the woman: “What are you talking about?”\nThat was when the woman realised her mistake, and said: “Oh, I’m sorry. Mummy please come here and sign off.”\nBefore leaving, Zoey asked for the woman's name, only to find she is the school’s principal.\nZoey said she is now considering changing schools for her son. When asked for the name of the institution, Zoey simply revealed that it is a “very popular school located in the Kowloon Tang district”.\nThe actress even created an online poll to ask her followers if she really resembled a helper that day. Funnily enough, her husband and brother were among the people who voted “yes”.\nZoey emphasised that while she, too, saw the humour in being mistaken for a Jie Jie, she was upset by the principal’s tone when she thought she was talking to a domestic helper.\n“This is what I’m mad about... Her attitude towards a domestic helper is to order her around. I don’t even treat my helper this way. A person who doesn’t have respect for others, how is she fit to be an educator, much less a principal?” said Zoey.\n\nShe then urged other parents to understand the workings of a school well before signing their kids up for classes."

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "Most of us are probably familiar with the landmine that is social media, and how harsh people can be.\nLocal beauty pageant Miss Grand Singapore, which is organised by investment management company AO Ventures, recently posted a video featuring 14 of its finalists.\n\nThe delegates were seeing partaking in a ‘This or That’ challenge, which had them catwalking in pairs before choosing an answer. \nUnfortunately, the video touched the wrong side of the internet, with many netizens criticising the finalists for their looks.\n“No minimum standards for this contest?” asked one netizen, while another joked: “Are they the crew?”\nOne particularly harsh comment read: “Totally CMI (can’t make it), there are so many pretty ones and only these ones participate.”\nThat comment got this reply from the organiser: “Thank you for the women empowerment support! They don’t have make-up nor filter at early morning training (sic).\"\nThis sparked a long chain of replies from other netizens, with one explaining that a beauty pageant is a contest about, well, beauty, yet people who are judging the delegates for their looks are getting called out. \nWhile we see why the organiser needed to stand up for the women, it begs us to ask: Why post a video of the finalists with no make-up or filters on in the first place?\nIn this social media age, basically anything on the internet is subject to judgement, be it good or nasty. So why give netizens ammunition? \nWhat do you think? Is it more important for beauty queens to look real and relatable? Or should they always put their best face forward, considering it is competition based on looks after all."

She then made Xiangyu wear the wedding dress. \nWhile Xiangyu appeared unwilling, he quickly realised he had no choice. \nThis time, the roles were reversed with Zihan asking for Xiangyu's hand in marriage in the photos. \nAs loving and adorable as they were, Zihan couldn't help but point out how \"ugly\" her husband looked in a dress.\nAnd he agrees.\n\n\"I really am ugly,\" wrote Xiangyu when sharing her post.

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "This weekend is your last chance to get a taste of Leong Yeow Chicken Rice’s popular Hainanese chicken rice. After nearly 50 years of running the business, Mdm Sun, 85, and her three sons are shutting down both their Waterloo and Queen Street stalls. Their last day of operations is on 27 May 2024.\nNews of the stall’s closure was first posted on Facebook by netizen Matthew Soh, who shared a notice that the stall owners had put up outside their shop. The notice reads: “We extend our deepest gratitude for your unwavering support and loyalty over the years. Your patronage has meant the world to us.”\nLeong Yeow Chicken Rice opened their first stall at Queen Street in 1978, before opening their Waterloo outlet the following year in 1979. Both shops, about a five-minute walk apart, have remained at the same location till now.\nMatthew wrote in his post that “rental kills a five-decade business”. But that may not be the case in this instance (more on that later). \n8days.sg reached out to Leong Yeow Chicken Rice co-owner, Mr Loy, 62, who simply says: “We’re all getting older, and we want to rest for a while”. He declines to elaborate on any rental issues, only hinting at some disagreements with the Waterloo coffee shop owner which he vaguely shared with us off the record. \nMeanwhile, BGain 261 Eating House’s manager (who declines to be named) at Waterloo Street tells 8days.sg that they offered to lower the monthly stall rental for Leong Yeow, but the hawkers did not accept the offer. “We are willing to lower the rent from $7,000 to $5,000 for them, but they still don’t want [to extend their tenure],” he says. He notes that the amount includes fees for dish collection and pest control. According to him, Mr Loy and his family had been paying this $7,000 in rent for the past three years already. 8days.sg reached out to Mr Loy to verify this information - while he didn’t deny it, he declined to address questions relating to rent, saying “I don’t want to speak so much about this [rental] issue”.  \nThe coffee shop manager shares that there’s low footfall in the area. “The Waterloo [coffeeshop] is in quite bad condition ’cos of the market changes. Lazada [located nearby] just retrenched over 200 employees,” he says. If what he speculates is true, we can only guess that the situation at the chicken rice stall’s neighbouring sister outlet might be similar. However, the coffee shop manager says he has no idea what business is like at Leong Yeow’s other outlet. 8days.sg tried to reach out to Albert Centre for more info, but were unable to contact them. \nLongtime patrons have taken to Matthew’s Facebook post to express sadness about Leong Yeow’s impending closure, saying things like “I am really shocked! Have been eating for the last three decades”. \nMatthew recounts that Mdm Sun was always very generous with him when he was a kid: “When we were very young, we always bought three packets of chicken rice ($1.60 x 3) and one packet of plain rice (50 cents), auntie will never forget to give us more meat and charged us only $5 in total.” \nHowever, it may not be goodbye forever. Mr Loy tells 8days.sg: “A lot of hawkers also rest for a year, and reopen [their stalls] in future. We’re resting now, but we can always reopen later.” \nLeong Yeow Chicken Rice’s last day of operations is on 27 May. Two outlets at BGain 261 Eating House, 261 Waterloo St, S180261 & #01-49 Albert Centre & 70 Queen St, S180270. Waterloo outlet open 11.30am - 8pm; Queen St outlet open 1.30pm - 8pm.

            "Article Body": "One downside of being known for your good-looks? People expect you to look perfect all the time. \nTake Taiwanese star Jerry Yan for example.\nThe 47-year-old actor got his start in showbiz as a model in 2000, when he was 23. A year later, he catapulted to fame playing Daoming Si in Meteor Garden. More than two decades on, Jerry is still known for his looks, and these days, often makes the news for looking younger than his age.\nHowever, a recent unretouched pic of Jerry has gone viral, proving that everyone ages, even Prince Charming. \nThe photo, an unedited close-up of Jerry's face, was taken by a fan during an event in China. In it, Jerry’s skin looked visibly textured, with netizens saying his complexion also \"appeared duller than usual\".\nThey claimed it was a far cry from the set of photos Jerry recently shared on his Weibo page, in which he was seen attending an event for a Japanese skincare brand.\nNaturally, those photos would have been edited, right?\nSome netizens were disappointed to discover that Jerry wasn’t as “perfect” as they expected, with one lamenting: “This is what Jerry Yan, who is pushing 50, really looks like.”\nTalk about unrealistic expectations.\nThankfully, there were also some netizens who clearly understood the laws of ageing.\nDefending Jerry, they wrote: “He already looks better than 99 per cent of people his age. He looks at least 10 years younger than his actual age.”"

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "Remember how Taiwanese actress Yao Yao, 33, was photographed Facetiming someone while strolling home alone in Taiwan last September and it turned out to be local actor Zong Zijie, 28? \nThough the pair, who play a couple in new supernatural movie The Chosen One, denied dating rumours at that time, they do seem suspiciously close to each other.\nYao Yao recently flew to Singapore for the premiere of the movie, reuniting with her castmates, Zijie, Gurmit Singh and Malaysian Singapore-based actress Angel Lim. \nDuring her time here, the actress spoke to Chinese media Zaobao about her experience filming her first Singaporean production. \nShe recalled how she had time to go shopping in Penang when they were  shooting there. Zijie, on the other hand, was busy slogging on set every day. \n\"He was either getting beaten up or having emotional scenes. I couldn't help but wonder: 'Oh my God, how pitiful is he?',\" she said, adding that Zijie's scenes with her were relatively \"sweet and relaxing\".\nZijie went on to talk about how tired he was filming the movie, as he had to travel between Malaysia and Singapore, where he was filming a drama. \n\"Luckily, the theme of the movie motivated me a lot and the crew took very good care of me, and my co-stars were all great actors,\" he said.\n\"And though it seemed like I went through a lot of hardship, [Yao Yao] was indeed my only source of warmth in this show,\" he added.\nDid he just confess his love for his leading lady?\nZijie quickly clarified: \"In the show, Ah Jiao [Yao Yao's character] really is my character Ah Jie's only source of warmth.\"\nYao Yao also said she became dependent on Zijie during the shoot. \nTo portray how needy her character is, her acting coach advised her to \"act like [she's] reliant on Zijie\" during the time they worked on the movie, and yes, that included when they were not on set. \n\"Zijie helped me carry my luggage and would buy me breakfast, drinks and even daily necessities. He would even ask me if I needed anything when he goes to the supermarket,\" she shared. \nPhotos: Zong Zijie/Instagram, Noontalk Media/TikTok\nCatch Zijie in I Do, Do I? on mewatch or in the video below: "

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "With its vibrant yellow signboard, month-old Big Dot Chicken stands out in a relatively quiet row of hawker stalls in Chinatown Complex Food Centre. The joint’s main offering – various cuts of fried chicken – is neatly displayed in a warmer on the counter. The menu also features $1 pandan waffles and $1.50 wafer ice cream.\nNo part of this story or photos can be reproduced without permission from 8days.sg.\n\nIn addition to being a snack stall, Big Dot Chicken hopes to make a difference by providing employment opportunities for the underserved. “If you feel that you’ve fallen through the cracks, or you are willing to work hard but you lack the opportunity, come work with us. We’re open to work with anyone,” shares Ken Koh, 40, the ‘head’ of the operation.\nKen, Jenny Lee, 45, (right in pic) and Hamidah Aidillah, 39, (left in pic) invested “a five-figure sum” to launch Big Dot Chicken. The business aims to help those who have a hard time finding a job. How? Ken claims they are willing to hire even people with no F&B experience, or those who can only work four-hour shifts daily due to family commitments. The bosses plan to open more stalls in future. \nAll three of them are entrepreneurs – Ken has a corporate training company and is a scion of a local F&B company (he declined to name the business on record, as the hawker stall is not affiliated to it), Hamidah runs a research analytics firm, and Jenny is a private dining chef who specialises in local and Peranakan cuisine. Jenny, who created the stall’s recipes, paused her business, Nanyang Chef, to focus on running the stall daily. Hamidah, an active volunteer, is in charge of community outreach and finding job seekers while Ken handles “everything else”.\nThe plan, Ken tells 8days.sg, is to eventually establish a brand that can be easily replicated and run by their staff. “If it works, we can provide not just employment at our stall but also train them to open their own stall, so that they can continue to multiply this impact and effort. We will licence them our brand, teach them our SOPs and supply them with ingredients for free. No franchise fee or royalties will be collected from them.”\nA noble idea, if it works out eventually. \nCurrently, they have two staff members (pictured in aprons) who are in their 50s. While they prefer not to share their names and background details for this story, the employees were friendly and warm during our visit. Despite being new hires, they seem comfortable managing the deep-fry and waffle stations in the stall.\nBig Dot Chicken pays their staff in cash – they earn $50 for every four-hour shift. “A lot of people live from hand to mouth, so we [implemented] paying on the spot,” Ken explains.\n“We want to offer simple, affordable food for everybody. We chose fried chicken, waffles and ice cream because they are happy food. Everyone from kids to grandparents can enjoy them,” says Ken. The stall is also applying for halal certification to ensure their food is accessible to all.\nThe jovial millennial continues: “We named the stall Big Dot Chicken because with Big Value, Big Portion and Big Heart, together you get a Big Dot (impact) and Big Happiness!”\n“Cheesy, right?” Hamidah teases, rolling her eyes in jest.\nMeanwhile, despite being open for only a month, Jenny is already feeling encouraged. “There’s a cleaner who usually only eats a loaf of bread [for a meal] and she has come to buy chicken at our stall. Several fellow hawkers have also become our regulars,” she shares happily. \nAs for the stall’s future, Ken says the team is keeping an open mind: “The hope is that as more people get to know us, we can cater for corporate events and more. With enough support, perhaps we can break even and carry on [our mission].” \nFor fried chicken, you can choose between original and spicy flavours, available a la carte or as a set meal. Prices range from $1.50 for a chicken wing to $5 for a combo with thigh, drumstick and fries. Waffles are made to order, with a plain one costing $1. Classic toppings like blueberry, chocolate and peanut butter are available for an additional 50 cents each. The stall also sells old-school Magnolia wafer ice cream for $1.50 each.\nWe tried the Original flavour first. Even though our chook came from the warmer and wasn’t freshly-fried, the pieces had a satisfying, crunchy coat. Jenny is secretive about what goes into the batter, but we found it a warm, fragrant blend of spices that evoke memories of the KFC we used to love when we were kids. \nIf, like us, you enjoyed KFC from the ‘good old days’, you’ll likely appreciate the nostalgic flavour captured in Big Dot Chicken’s delish version. Marinated overnight, the meat is tender and well-seasoned. Our only grouse? Some pieces are saltier than others. \nThe set comes with crispy medium-cut fries. You can also order the chicken wing and drumstick a la carte at $1.50 and $2 respectively.\nThe Spicy version has a smokier, more peppery punch. Among the different cuts of chook we tried, the thigh was the juiciest – we’d definitely order it again. As a comparison, a piece of chicken costs $4.60 at KFC, while a chicken thigh here is $2.50. The portion is also slightly larger at Big Dot Chicken, plus you get to choose your favourite cuts (of course, it’s important to note that a hawker stall and fast food chain offer different dining experiences).\nThe waffle here is on the thinner, crispier side. It’s smaller than the usual heartland versions, but also more affordable. Sweet and tangy, the blueberry spread pairs well with the waffle’s hint of pandan. Not bad for a cheap tea time snack.\nThe stall also offers old-school wafer ice cream for $1.50 each. Flavours include classics like raspberry ripple and chocolate, fun to eat and almost like being back in primary school.\nBig Dot Chicken’s fried chook is well-marinated, fragrant and tastier than most hawker versions – and more affordable too. We prefer the milder spice blend of the Original flavour, and recommend ordering the larger, juicier thigh meat. \nBig Dot Chicken is at #02-223 Chinatown Complex Food Centre, 335 Smith St, S050335. Open Mon to Fri, 11am to 9pm (or sold out).

            "Article Body": "Have you ever had a prank backfire on you?\nLocal influencer and mum-of-three, Vanny (@Vannytelly), recently shared on TikTok a prank she played on her seven-year-old daughter, Hope.\nShe and her family of five spent the day at Orchard Central’s indoor playground, X-scap8.\nVanny's plan was to prank the birthday girl Hope with a 50-cent-sized ‘micro cake’, and then later surprise her with the real cake, a larger rabbit-shaped one.\nHope first smiled when she saw the micro cake and was told by her older sister — who was in on the prank — that the reason for its size was “because [Hope] needed to lose weight”.\nThings went downhill after that as Hope looked like she was trying to hold her tears back.\n\n\"Don’t want to take video,” she said. That was when Vanny decided to call cut.\nVanny later included a clip of the birthday girl sobbing in her dad’s arms, along with the caption: “Oh no we made her cry!”\nThankfully, Hope cheered up when she got her actual birthday cake, which had the message “We are just joking because you are perfect”.\nVanny later shared the same clip on Instagram, where she gave more context on the situation.\n\nShe revealed that Hope was a premature baby, so she did all she could to “fatten her up”.\n\n“She grew into a cute chubby baby and we loved it!” Vanny wrote.\nWhile Hope lost weight as she grew older, she “ballooned up in just a mere two months” after entering primary school.\n\nVanny said she herself had struggled with an eating disorder and body image issues in the past, and so she tries to get her girls to “eat healthier and balanced [meals]” so they would not have the same experience as her.\n\nShe also said they would tease each other about their weight at home and so she did not expect Hope to react that way, as they would normally just laugh it off. \nVanny later realised that Hope cried because she was affected by the message — “bcuz’ you need to lose weight\" — written on the cake. \nVanny has since been criticised for playing such a prank. Netizens chided her for hurting Hope’s feelings, adding that it may cause her “trauma” that she “will remember for the rest of her life”.\nVanny also admitted that she made a mistake and said that she feels “utterly bad about it”. She said she has since had a talk with Hope and has also apologised for her actions. \n“Mum guilt at its worse and I’ve learnt a mistake from this. Sorry baby girl. Mummy is happy seeing you smile again,” wrote Vanny."

            "Article Body": "Some teachers touch the lives of their students in the most special ways. \nA teacher in Sarawak, Malaysia, recently had the brilliant idea to give his classroom a total makeover, transforming the otherwise drab place into a chic cafe.\n\nKelantan native Muhamad Tarmizi Awang, known as Cikgu Tarmizi to his students, worked on the project in conjunction with Malaysia's Teacher’s Day, which falls on May 16. \nThe renovation was done with the aim of motivating his students to attend school.\nHe shared before and after pics of the classroom on Facebook, writing: “From an ordinary classroom to a comfortable one. I would like to share some of the work done by me, a teacher in a rural school in Malaysia.”\nAccording to reports, Cikgu Tarmizi has been teaching at the primary school in Daro, Sekolah Kebangsaan Kut, since 2019. \nSince they were located in a rural part of town, Cikgu Tarmizi’s school of 32 kids have never experienced what a “hipster cafe” is like. So he came up with the “The Cafe Class”, a better and more aesthetic learning space for his students. \nCikgu Tarmizi started out funding the project himself, and later received financial assistance from the school’s parent-teacher association. 10 teachers and school staff also helped him with the renovations. \nHere's what the space looked like before...\nCikgu Tarmizi, along with his colleagues, have also decided to renovate other areas of the school, in hopes to increase attendance. \nHe has since worked with the school’s headmaster to launch a garden project, on which each student takes care of their own cabbage plant, from watering to fertilising, to eventually selling it. \n“We did this to teach students about responsibility, and most importantly, so they would enjoy coming to school because if they don’t, their cabbage plants might die,” said Cikgu Tarmizi.

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "In February earlier this year, young chef Renee Tang, 29, made a surprise announcement. She was closing her well-received Jelebu Dry Laksa restaurant at VivoCity, just slightly over a year after opening.\nThe eatery was set up in partnership with hospitality group Tipsy Collective, which told 8days.sg that the closure was “part of their opening strategic evaluation” after the group’s co-founder Derek Ong, 35, passed away unexpectedly.\nRenee told 8days.sg that she had no plans to open another Jelebu Dry Laksa restaurant, but would be working on a “new concept” independently from Tipsy Collective. Fast forward three months, and she has unveiled her latest project: Choon Hoy Parlor.\nNo part of this story or photos can be reproduced without permission from 8days.sg.\nChoon Hoy Parlor is opened and owned by chef Dylan Ong, 36, who founded popular affordable French restaurant Saveur and, later, Franco-Asian restaurant The Masses. For the menu and kitchen operations, he collaborates with two female chefs, Renee, and Benji Chew, 37, who was formerly cooking at The Masses.\nThe restaurant takes over The Masses’s former spot at 85 Beach Road (the latter has moved to Capitol Singapore). It is named after Dylan’s mother, Mdm Ong Choon Hoy, whom he credits for painstakingly taking care of their family by taking on three concurrent jobs as a hawker assistant and hawker centre cleaner.\nTo pay tribute to Mdm Ong’s home cooking, Choon Hoy Parlor serves “Singapore soul food” using heirloom recipes passed down by the three chefs’ families. Like Saveur and The Masses, prices are kept wallet-friendly here, similar to what you’d expect to pay at a kopitiam zi char stall (but you get a more hip, air-conditioned dining experience here).\nThe menu offerings are split into family heirloom dishes, heritage dishes and “recreated heritage recipes” reworked by the young chefs.\nThis includes a Teochew-style Pork Leg Trotter Jelly ($8.90), which was inspired by Dylan’s father, a kway chap hawker who used to save leftover meat from waste by turning them into pork trotter jelly. The humble but well-loved dish traditionally utilises oft-discarded pork parts like crunchy ear cartilage, skin and hind trotters.\nHe also introduces his mum’s ABC Soup ($8.90), which is usually homecooked with carrots, tomatoes and potatoes, but gets a slightly more premium twist here with additional pork ribs and onions.\nMeanwhile, Renee contributes Braised Dua Cai ($16.90), cooked using a recipe inherited from her late Teochew grandmother, who used to make the decadent dish every Chinese New Year for 50 of her family members. The dua cai (also known as dua chua/ mustard greens) is charred and braised with hae bee, mushrooms, pork belly and sea cucumbers in a scallop stock.\nShe also offers her CHP x Jelebu Dry Laksa V2.0 ($18.90, good for three pax) here, which is described as “a dish that combines the essence of dry laksa with chao-tah beehoon”. The wok-fried dish is tossed with rempah, taugeh, fish cakes, tau pok and blanched blood cockles.\nFor a cold appetiser at Choon Hoy Parlor, you can order… rojak. Chef Benji Chew, whose parents used to run a zi char stall in Ipoh and later scaled down to a simpler operation selling rojak, reimagines her folks’ recipe by coming up with a rojak-flavoured ice cream called CHP Signature Our Rojak Our Own Way ($8.90).\nPunchy har cheong (prawn paste)-infused rojak sauce is made into ice cream, served with requisite rojak fruits and veggies like jambu, star fruit and jicama. It is topped with century egg, you tiao and coarsely crushed peanuts.\nOther local hawker and zi char-style favourites to expect include the CHP Signature Hainanese Kampong Chicken with Scallion and Ginger Sauce ($15.90 half / $28.90 whole), Teochew Steamed Fish (market price), Coin Prata with Masala Lamb ($13.90), Roasted Pork Belly ($18.90), Dry Bak Kut Teh in Claypot ($22.90) and 16-Hr Bone-In Coffee Angus Short Rib ($69 for 700g to 800g).\nValue-for-money Set Lunches are also available, starting from $18.90 per pax for a five-course meal with a soup, hot/cold appetiser, a meat or seafood dish, a vegetable dish and a beverage.\n\nChoon Hoy Parlor is at #01-02, 85 Beach Rd, S189694. Tel: 6266-0061.

            "Article Body": "After working as a roast meat chef at Crystal Jade and Paradise Group for nine years, Fujian-born cook, Fu Shigao, 51, now runs a soup stall at Yishun Park Hawker Centre. \nShigao opened Lao Fu Jia Stewed Soup Steamed Delights in January 2024 with his wife (also a Singapore PR from China, who declines to be named). Shigao relocated to Singapore for work in 2007. He has 30 years of cooking experience, beginning his career at a restaurant back home in Fujian.\nNo part of this story or photos can be reproduced without permission from 8days.sg.\nShigao worked at Crystal Jade and Paradise Group from 2008 to 2015 before leaving to set up a roast meat hawker biz. He rejoined Crystal Jade from 2019 to 2021 when the pandemic hit. \nWhile he could’ve stayed on in his corporate job, his rationale for leaving the comfier restaurant setting is simple: “Everyone has a dream of starting their own business. If you work for people, the salary is stagnant. If you open your own shop, you can [potentially] earn more”. \nShigao also shares that “the salary for a chef these days is not very high”. At his previous jobs, he was earning around $3,000 to $4,000 a month. \nThus, the chef opened his own hawker stall, initially selling roast meat like char siew and duck. He relocated his stalls thrice - from Bedok to Ang Mo Kio to Marsiling - but business wasn’t great, though the hawker says he “didn’t make a loss”. “After selling roast meat for so many years, I feel that only older people like it, and older people have different health concerns, so they don't dare to eat it often even if they wanted to,” he explains. \nAnd so, the persistent hawker decided to sell soup instead. Why soup? His wife says: “Soup is healthy, [we felt] it would be wise to go down this path. It’s suitable for all ages and good for one’s health, we felt that our business would be better if we sold it”. True enough, Shigao says that his soup stall attracts customers of all ages now. \nBut is roast meat or soup easier to cook? Shigao says: “To us chefs, we already know how to make these things, they’re all around the same [level of difficulty]”. That being said, he couldn’t sell both roast meat and soup at the same stall, as the hawker centre only allowed him to specialise in one item. \nShigao invested $20,000 into his current stall, but says business is around the same as at his now-defunct roast meat stalls because he is new to the area, and doesn't have many regulars yet. \nThankfully, he is still earning more versus his previous restaurant jobs, though he declines to reveal the exact figure. “Business is so-so, but I’m still earning more than before – if not I would’ve closed shop already!” he laughs. \nAs this is Shigao’s first time running a soup stall, he spent six months perfecting his recipe. His dishes are strictly MSG-free: “I had to experiment with what ingredients to put in to substitute the MSG”. \nHe says his current recipes aren’t inspired by those from Crystal Jade and Paradise Group.\nShigao boils a separate pot of pork bone broth for eight hours daily, and uses that as a base for all his soups. \nLao Fu Jia Stewed Soup Steamed Delights offers six types of soup: White Radish Pork Ribs Soup ($5.50), Watercress Pork Ribs Soup ($5.50), Old Cucumber Pork Ribs Soup ($5.50), Corn with Carrot Pork Ribs Soup ($5.50), Lotus Root Pork Ribs Soup ($6.50) and Herbal Chicken Soup ($7). \nThey also sell dishes to pad up your meal, like Preserved Veg Braised Pork ($7), Steamed Chicken with Mushroom and Chinese Sausage ($6), Steamed Egg with Minced Meat ($4.50) and Pig’s Trotter ($6). \n8days.sg tries the stall’s best-selling Lotus Root Pork Ribs Soup, Corn with Carrot Pork Ribs Soup, and Preserved Veg Braised Pork. \nWith a clean-tasting broth, our lotus root soup tastes healthy but still flavourful enough, with a slightly nutty hint from the peanuts in it. It brims with decently tender pork ribs, which we paired with rice for an extra 70 cents.\nThis simple but homey soup dish comes with a generous portion of pork ribs, corn and carrots. The broth is again light, but this time infused with the natural sweetness of corn. We prefer the richer lotus root soup, but this is a comforting dish nonetheless. \nWhile it’s unreasonable to expect this ex-restaurant chef’s soups to be restaurant-quality at these prices, they’re tasty enough and more wholesome than the offerings from most other hawker stalls. Pro tip: Shigao is offering a $1 return voucher for every $10 spent at Lao Fu Jia. \nLao Fu Jia Stewed Soup Steamed Delights is at #01-20 Yishun Park Hawker Centre, 51 Yishun Ave 11, S768867. Open daily 11am - 9pm. Occasionally closed on Thur. \nPhotos: Gwyn Lim\nNo part of this story or photos can be reproduced without permission from 8days.sg.\n8days.sg is now on #tiktok!

            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — She loved drinking bubble tea and whenever she felt stressed at work, she often snacked on “healthy” granola bars and fruit snacks.\nEven though she told her dentist that she always chose reduced-sugar food items and that she was diligent about her oral hygiene routine, she was having several oral health problems at the age of 30.\nDr James Ho, founder and chief executive officer of GPlus Dental Center and G Dental Center, said that despite the young officer worker was having cavities and gum inflammation, which made her swollen gums bleed easily whenever she brushed her teeth.\nThe enamel surface of her teeth also showed signs of erosion, leading to tooth sensitivity.\nFor many Singaporeans, snacking throughout the day is not just a casual indulgence; it is a way of life. However, the frequent consumption of sugar-laden treats and beverages has come at a cost to their oral health.\nCoupled with poor dental habits, it is no wonder that a significant proportion of adults here have to deal with oral health problems and retaining their natural teeth as they age.\nThe latest National Adult Oral Health Survey in 2019 revealed that around a third (35 per cent) of Singaporeans aged 21 and above suffer from untreated dental caries.\nAdditionally, a staggering 94 per cent of adults were found to have gum disease, which if left untreated, can progress to more severe conditions and even tooth loss.\nIn 2020, the National Dental Centre Singapore (NDCS) launched the Oral Health Movement 8020, a pilot programme that encourages people aged 40 and above to maintain at least 20 of their natural teeth beyond the age of 80.\nIts pilot study involving 780 adults aged 40 and above found that around 17 per cent were in the orally pre-frail or had tipped into the orally frail state. This means that a decline in oral function affects their ability to chew, swallow and speak.\nA key factor contributing to oral frailty is the number of remaining teeth.\nDr Chan Pei Yuan, the programme lead for the Oral Health Movement 8020, noted that the programme has brought attention to the low awareness and prioritisation of oral health among Singaporeans.\nDr Chan also pointed out that the National Adult Oral Health Survey found that more than a third (34.4 per cent) of the adults surveyed visited the dentist only when they experienced a problem with their teeth, mouth or dentures.\nRegular cleaning and preventive care are key to keeping your teeth and gums healthy.\nDr Lee Wan Zhen, head of the periodontics unit with the department of restorative dentistry at NDCS, said: “Those who neglect regular dental check-ups and fail to address cavities in their early stages are at risk of losing their natural teeth permanently.”\nDr Ho cautioned: “Delaying dental care can worsen cavities, requiring invasive treatments like root canals or extractions, while untreated gum disease may lead to costly procedures such as preventable gum surgery or tooth loss.\n“Similarly, ignoring a cracked tooth can result in infections, necessitating expensive treatments like dental crowns or root canals.”\nThe dental experts listed below some common habits that are bad for your teeth and gums, along with what you can do to save your teeth and improve your oral health.\nSome people who are trying to lose weight believe that snacking or grazing on small meals throughout the day helps to boost metabolism rate.\nNot only is this not a proven claim, it is bad for your teeth because taking frequent small meals or snacks throughout the day does not give saliva enough time to neutralise acids in the mouth.\nHowever, being constantly on the move and juggling demanding work and personal schedules may mean that many younger adults tend to snack, rather than adhere to proper mealtimes, he said.\n“They also have a higher tendency to skip meals or have irregular meal patterns, since they eat when they feel is convenient to them.\n“Saliva production typically increases during meal times. Skipping meals or frequent snacking, especially when you snack outside of regular mealtimes, means there will be less saliva to help rinse away food particles and neutralise acids in the mouth, increasing the risk of cavities and gum disease,” he said.\nDr Lee from NDCS explained that while eating or drinking, especially foods high in sugar or acids, the pH level in the mouth becomes more acidic, meaning the pH level becomes lower.\nWhen the pH levels fall below a certain critical level, the enamel that is the hard outer structure of teeth starts to dissolve.\n“Snacking throughout the day exposes teeth to a constant source of sugars that can be used by the oral bacteria to produce acids.\n“With frequent snacking, this acidic environment can persist for an extended period below the critical pH level (of 5.5), thereby providing ample time for acids to erode enamel and dentine (the middle layer of the tooth) and weaken teeth.\n“If snacking replaces meals or if snacks are low in water content, it can result in low salivary flow. Reduced saliva flow means less protection against acid attacks, increasing the risk of tooth decay,” Dr Lee added.\nWHAT YOU CAN DO:\nHave regular meals at fixed timings. This results in fewer acid attacks on the teeth, compared to continuous snacking, Dr Lee said.\n“Meals consumed at regular hours are followed by a period of time before the next meal, allowing time for saliva to neutralise acids and re-mineralise teeth between eating episodes,” she explained.\nDr Ho said that continuous chewing — for at least 20 minutes — during regular mealtimes stimulates higher saliva flow.\n“Saliva contains essential minerals like calcium and phosphate, which help in the re-mineralisation process, repairing early signs of enamel erosion and decay.”\nDr Lee advised having three balanced meals a day and if needed, to take oral health-friendly snacks in between (see point below).\nPopular sugary snacks and drinks that are sticky and chewy such as kueh, glutinous rice balls, mochi and bubble tea with its add-on gelatinous items in the form of jelly and tapioca balls tend to adhere to teeth, filling crevices and spaces for extended periods of time, promoting bacterial growth.\nEven dishes such as fried carrot cake with sweet dark soya sauce, mee siam and mee rebus has high sugar content.\nA diet high in sugar, acidic foods and beverages can contribute to tooth decay and erosion. This can weaken the enamel surface of teeth, making teeth more susceptible to cracking and also lead to tooth loss over time.   \nThe types of food and drinks considered acidic are citrus fruit such as oranges, vinegar-based salad dressings and health products such as apple cider vinegar.\nDr Lee said that people who engage in an active lifestyle or play sports regularly might consume isotonic energy drinks, which can be high in sugars and acids.\nPeople may also drink sweetened caffeinated beverages such as instant coffee or caffeinated energy drinks to stay awake, most of which contain sugars, she added.\nBesides weakening tooth enamel, excessive sugar intake fuels bacteria in the mouth that can cause cavities.\nWHAT YOU CAN DO:\nPick nutritious snacks that are low in sugar and acids, while high in nutrients such as fibre, calcium and vitamins. Some examples are:\nDr Ho also said that although the choice of snacks may be important, it is not just acidic or sugary foods and beverages that may solely and directly affect oral health.\n“In the aftermath of snacking, take care of food particles that can become lodged between teeth, which promote bacterial growth and increase the risk of dental issues.\n“Post-snacking oral hygiene practices can help to reduce potential oral health problems. Do what is practically possible, like swishing water in your mouth after meals.\n“To minimise direct contact between sweet drinks and teeth, consider using a straw, which can reduce the risk of enamel erosion and tooth decay.\n“To minimise plastic, there are eco-friendly stainless steel straws and bamboo straws alternatives,” he added.\nThe dentists also suggested consuming sugary or acidic food and drinks as part of a meal — for example, at the end of the meal — rather than as snacks throughout the day or a standalone snack. The increased saliva production during meals would help neutralise the acids.\n“Try to avoid snacking right before bedtime because saliva production decreases during sleep, leaving teeth more vulnerable to acids.\n“If you must snack at night, opt for a small low-sugar snack, drink water and brush your teeth afterward,” Dr Lee advised.\nDr Ho pointed out that some research suggested that brushing teeth immediately after consuming something acidic can damage the enamel, so it may be advisable to wait around 30 minutes before brushing.\nHowever, removing food that stick between teeth should be done right after meals, either by flossing or even using a toothpick, he said.\nIf you do not drink enough plain water throughout the day, it can lead to a dry mouth, increasing the risk of cavities due to reduced salivary flow, Dr Lee said.\nWHAT YOU CAN DO:\nStaying adequately hydrated — with plain water — is essential for maintaining saliva production and good oral health.\nRinsing the mouth with water after consuming sweet beverages and food can also reduce teeth’s exposure to sugars and acids.\n“It helps to dilute and to wash away some of the sugar and acid residues, which can lessen the risk of tooth decay and enamel erosion,” Dr Ho advised.\nWhen munching on hard, crunchy food, it is advisable to exercise caution because that is a common cause of dental emergencies such as cracked teeth or lost fillings.\n“Hard, crunchy snacks can be detrimental to dental health as they can cause microscopic fractures in tooth enamel. In this hot weather, I also caution my patients against chewing on ice cubes,” Dr Ho said.\nExamples of hard food items that can cause such tiny fractures over time include nuts, potato chips or certain types of biscuits such as pretzel biscuits.\nThat said, the extent of damage can vary, based on other factors such as dental health, enamel strength and some eating habits.\nFor instance, teeth grinding, trauma from accidents or sports injury may weaken the tooth structure. Or habits such as cracking open chicken bone or crab shells using teeth can also cause stress fractures to accumulate on teeth, which may result in cracked or split teeth over time, Dr Lee said.\nFor denture wearers, consuming hard, crunchy snacks can be problematic as well.\n“These snacks can exert excessive pressure on dentures, leading to discomfort, soreness or even damage to the dentures.\n“Also, hard food may cause dentures to become dislodged or loosen, increasing the risk of injury to the mouth or throat,” Dr Ho said.\nAnd on one other point, Dr Ho emphasised that “teeth are not tools”. Use the proper tools intended for opening packages and bottles or to crack hard nuts.\n“Once, a patient told me that whenever she could not rip a snack packaging apart, she would use her teeth instead.\n“I strongly advise not to use your teeth to open bottles, packages or perform other tasks because it can lead to chipping or other damage,” he said.\nWHAT YOU CAN DO:\nDr Ho has the following tips for minimising the risk of cracked teeth while eating harder or crunchy food.\nDr Chan, a consultant at the department of restorative dentistry in NDCS, said that for people with teeth grinding or clenching habits, managing stress or using a mouthguard can help prevent cracked teeth and preserve natural teeth.\nThen, there are parafunctional habits such as clenching of teeth, frequently chewing on hard foods, which can cause problems.\nWearing a mouthguard when playing sports or doing high-impact activities such as skateboarding is also helpful.\nRegular dental check-ups are essential to detect and treat any emerging problems, which can prevent dental problems from progressing  and leading to tooth loss later in life, Dr Chan added.\nNot brushing and flossing properly, or missing spots when cleaning allow plaque to build up on teeth and gums.\nBrushing and flossing are integral in preventing tooth decay because they remove the “food source” for the bacteria that causes tooth decay.\nIf there is a thick biofilm of dental plaque, saliva cannot penetrate between teeth to help re-mineralise and reverse some of the acid damage on teeth, Dr Lee said.\nUrging young adults not to delay or neglect routine dental check-ups due to their busy schedules, Dr Ho said that this group of adults may have the perception that they are healthy and do not see the need to visit their dentist regularly.\nThis is not true at all.\nImproving oral health requires a joint effort between home oral care and guidance provided by a dentist, he added.\nBesides detecting and treating issues early, a dentist can also give personalised instruction on how to brush and floss your teeth properly based on the person’s dental profile.\nWHAT YOU CAN DO:\nDr Ho advised dedicating three to four minutes to oral care routine at least twice a day using a fluoride toothpaste.\nIncorporate flossing into your daily routine to clean between teeth and remove plaque from areas that your toothbrush may not reach.\nSelecting the right dental products matter, too.\nUse a toothpaste with fluoride to help neutralise harmful acid and strengthen the enamel.  \nDr Ho advised choosing a toothbrush with soft bristles and consider using an antiseptic or fluoride mouthwash as a form of supplementary oral care.\nAddressing the misconception that brushing harder or using a hard bristle brush removes more plaque, he said: “We sometimes hear dentists say, ‘Don't brush your teeth like you are scrubbing the kitchen floor’.\n“This is to emphasise to patients the need for gentle, circular motions rather than harsh scrubbing.\n“Using hard bristle brushes and brushing too vigorously can be harmful to oral health rather than beneficial.”\nDr Ho also said that although some studies may suggest potential risks of long-term mouthwash use, such as cancer, the evidence is inconclusive.\n“Using mouthwash with fluoride regularly is beneficial after brushing and flossing. If you have just had oral surgery, and your dentist advises that you use mouthwash containing chlorohexidine, then you should do so.\n“Always consult your dentist and voice out any concerns that you may have. It is important to cultivate a trusting relationship with your dentist by having open communication,” he said.\nSchedule regular dental visits at least once a year, or as advised by your dentist. Dr Ho said that it is advisable to, where possible, try to stick with a regular dentist.\n“Dentist-hopping could perhaps lead to delay in detecting and treating dental issues and cause more permanent damage down the road.”"

This is because discussing past difficult experiences tends to be highly triggering and it is important to set the child to process these memories in a safe way.\nCreative and expressive therapies such as art, play, music and drama may also help children who cannot verbalise their trauma due to pain and shock.\nFriends at the Child Guidance Clinic works with schools, the police, social service organisations, the Ministry of Social and Family Development and other agencies to support children and youth. They include young offenders, youth-at-risk, child abuse victims and families involved in complex custody and access disputes.\nThe Resilience Programme workshops help children with parents who have a psychiatric illness develop resilience and understand what mental health is. They also learn skills to manage the everyday challenges they face at home.\nThe society makes a concerted effort to use a trauma-informed approach to support children with adverse childhood experiences and their families.\nIts practitioners are trained to carry out a psychosocial programme called Be The Light, developed by psychosocial trauma support services at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH) to support children and caregivers after a traumatic event.\nIn 2019, KKH started a home visitation pilot programme called Anchor with the partnership of Temasek Foundation to support children under the age of four who are exposed to adverse childhood experiences. As of February this year, more than 160 children have been enrolled in the programme.\nThe programme is fully funded by Temasek Foundation, the charitable arm of state investor Temasek Holdings, and is also voluntary, which means that parental consent is obtained before a child is enrolled.\nChildren are referred to the Anchor programme if they are:\n- Under the age of four and seen in KKH for suspected non-accidental injuries\n- The child’s sibling who is also under the age of four and living in the same household.\nYouth centres under the Singapore Children’s Society.\nFei Yue's Online Counselling Service: eC2.sg website (Mon to Fri, 10am to 12pm, 2pm to 5pm).\nInstitute of Mental Health's Mental Health Helpline: 6389-2222 (24 hours).\nSamaritans of Singapore: 1800-221-4444 (24 hours) / 1-767 (24 hours).\nSingapore Association for Mental Health: 1800-283-7019 (Mon to Fri, 9am to 6pm).\nSilver Ribbon Singapore: 6386-1928 / 6509-0271 (Mon to Fri, 9am to 6pm).\nTinkle Friend: 1800-274-4788 (Mon to Fri, 2.30pm to 5pm).\nTouchline (Counselling): 1800-377-2252 (Mon to Fri, 9am to 6pm)",
            "Article Body": "Please be advised that the articles delve into trauma-related topics that may be triggering to the reader.\nSINGAPORE — Adverse childhood experiences are potentially traumatic events that occur in a child’s life before the age of 18.\nSome of them are harmful and obvious when there is abuse and maltreatment. Others are less apparent but equally traumatic such as enduring pain from an injury or prolonged hospitalisation, not fitting in among peers and emotional neglect from parents.\nIn children and teenagers who are still growing physically, cognitively and emotionally, these early adverse experiences can leave a negative imprint on their development, behaviour and health right into adulthood.\nIn an ideal world, every child will grow up safe, loved and supported. Yet, painful and distressing experiences are sometimes unavoidable, and not every child has the inner resources and capacity to bounce back on their own from the shock or hurt.\nSo what are the signs to watch for in children and teenagers who are traumatised? And what can be done to help them recover from an adverse childhood experience or traumatic event?\nOne thing is clear and especially crucial: The presence of a safe and nurturing environment and equivalent relationships. Just one consistent adult figure who can provide love and care is the key to help them start healing.\nHowever, an important step is to first acknowledge the occurrence of a traumatic experience, because healing cannot begin in silence or denial.\nAdjunct Associate Professor Daniel Fung, chief executive officer of the Institute of Mental Health (IMH),  said: “We need to recognise that there was a potentially traumatic event and help the child to deal with it.\n“There’s a saying that a burden shared is a burden halved.\n“I've seen a number of children where the parents are really in denial of something that has happened in the family when it's clear that there was abuse. And that’s painful for the child.”\nAlthough different children may process a traumatic event differently, some tell-tale signs to pay attention to are:\nResearch from the Singapore Children’s Society found that having one or more consistent, safe attachment adult figure in the child’s life can help the child bounce back after adversity.\nIn the absence of parents, these adults may be other family members, family friends, school counsellors, teachers, befrienders, mentors or neighbours.\nWhat if parents or immediate family cannot provide support or continue to be the source of trauma, for example, in cases of child abuse or ill-treatment?\nSenior clinical psychologist Jeremy Heng said that in such cases, professional agencies such as Family Service Centres and the Child Protective Service under the Ministry of Social and Family Development will work with other adults in the child’s life to establish safety.\nHe added: “Having someone who trusts in you, who tells you that whatever negative things that have happened is not your fault, that you are safe, are loved and wanted, that you belong, are good enough and that the future is hopeful.\n“These messages help ground a child and give them an opportunity to develop healthily and thrive in spite of their adverse childhood experiences.”\nMr Heng is the deputy head of Sunbeam Place at Singapore Children’s Society, a residential home for abused and neglected children.\nThere, for example, the residential care workers are parental figures for many of the young residents. Not only do they provide care, they also gently guide them to correct their mistakes using “teachable moments”.\nMr Heng illustrated how it often takes a village to support traumatised children: An eight-year-old was referred to Sunbeam Place after prolonged harsh physical punishment and emotional rejection by her parents.\nWhen she was first admitted, her intense emotional and behavioural outbursts often meant that she was biting, punching and scratching the staff members.\nA group people were roped in to give the necessary support: A psychologist, residential care workers, a child development team and social workers.\n“Currently, the teenager (now aged 14) is thriving in secondary school and is vice-captain for her sports co-curricular activity. She copes well with distress and relational conflicts, using her preferred emotional regulation strategies,” Mr Heng said.\n“She also encourages and takes care of younger residents (at Sunbeam Place)who struggle with managing their difficult emotions because they remind her of her younger self.\n“Most importantly, she is going home to her family in the next few months because both the professionals and her family have expressed confidence in a safe and stable reunification.”\nReferring to Singapore Children’s Society’s research, Mr Heng said that when children who perceived that they had no one or only a few people whom they can turn to for emotional support, those who were exposed to more adverse childhood experiences had more of what is known as “internalising problems”, which are the feelings that develop internally such as anxiety, social withdrawal and depression.\nWhen they perceived that they had more people to turn to, they were less likely to experience these feelings.\nMr Heng said that receiving the appropriate intervention after a traumatic event is critical. This is to ensure that the child feels safe and is not in immediate danger or harm.\nIt helps the child make sense of what has happened and reduce the likelihood of psychological troubles later.\n“No other intervention may be effective if the harm continues,” he added.\nClinical psychologist Claire Ng from IMH said that trauma-focused work with children often involves working closely with families and communities.\n“A large part of the work is helping children and families understand the impact of trauma on children,” she said.\n“This helps families develop empathy for the child who may have difficulties regulating their emotions and behaviour after experiencing trauma.\n“Another important part of the work is also helping caregivers understand how to help the child feel safe, both physically and emotionally.”\nMs Ng is with IMH’s department of developmental psychiatry and the forensic rehabilitation, intervention, evaluation and network development services (Friends).\nTrauma Systems Therapy is one form of therapy used that actively involves the caregivers and communities to support the child:\nAn approach called Trauma-informed Positive Behavioural Interventions and Supports (TI-PBIS) is used in the residential care setting at Sunbeam Place under the Singapore Children’s Society.\nIt is a system of care that equips children with adaptive behaviours that help them regulate their emotions and form positive social connections.\nTo promote social connections, each of its six dormitories is set up to resemble a typical Singaporean household, with a living room, study room and bedrooms.\nThe residents have daily routines and activities that are mundane but critical in promoting positive behaviour and social interaction, Mr Heng said.\nFor example, having meals together and sharing about their day, deciding on activities to do as a group and studying together.\nBesides letting the residents feel they are safe and loved, can trust others and have control, the recurring positive interactions allow them to “unlearn” maladaptive interaction patterns such as being aggressive to protect themselves, and to learn healthier ways to relate to others.\n“They also learn skills to tolerate distress and regulate themselves using more effective and healthier methods.\n“This is why having one or more consistent safe and trusted adult attachment figures is so critical to scaffold, guide and promote the learning of necessary skills to support the recovery of these children and youth,” Mr Heng explained.\nIn Singapore, various programmes are in place to support traumatised children. The following are just a few of them.\n1. INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH\n2. SINGAPORE CHILDREN’S SOCIETY\nMs Ang Jia Yi, a counsellor at Yishun Family Service under the Singapore Children’s Society, said: “The aim is to reduce the likelihood of individuals developing more severe distress and trauma symptoms. The majority of them return to normalcy with adequate support.”\n3. KK WOMEN’S AND CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL\nDr Yeleswarapu Padmini, senior consultant with KKH’s department of child development, said: “(Information on) the history of non-accidental injuries could come from one of the parents, community agency supporting the family or from preschool if they have identified any signs and symptoms suggestive of any non-accidental injuries.\n“At the same time, a detailed evaluation of the child and information gathered by the medical social worker as part of the social evaluation would also be considered.”\nDr Padmini added that children who are exposed to adverse childhood experiences often come from families that have competing needs. These may include financial concerns or the child’s caregiver could have mental health ailments.\nOne of the advantages of receiving help through the Anchor programme is that the interventions are carried out in the family's home. \nThe team — consisting of various professionals — comes up with individualised plans to address the specific challenges that the child and family have. \nFor example, children exposed to a significant traumatic event will get support from a psychologist who can provide more trauma-focused interventions.\nFor children with health or developmental problems, they will be supported by paediatricians and allied health professionals. \nMs Ng from IMH said that humans are innately wired to seek connection and learn about themselves, others and the world through the eyes of their early caregivers.\n“If a child can rely on safe, reliable caregivers to meet their needs, they develop a mental model of the world as a safe place.\n“This perception of a secure base allows them to explore the world with confidence, develop healthy relationships, manage setbacks effectively and so on,” she explained.\nUnderstanding the impact of adverse childhood experiences and the struggles that families face spurred Morning Star Community Services to launch a free evening “drop-in” service in 2016.\nThe child may be dropped off at the centre where it runs its CareNights programme, which supports lower-income families in need who require care for their children on weekday nights.\nThis gives parents time at night for work or to take courses to improve their skills. This also allows them to get a respite for families going through a difficult time such as those undergoing divorce or attending to critically ill family members.\nCareNights also conduct parenting workshops and organise parent-child bonding activities such as outings and birthday celebrations for children who attends CareNights and their families.\nA large proportion of families that place their children with CareNights are single-parent households. It currently supports 63 children across four centres.\nMr Lemuel Yanos Baculanta, the programme’s assistant manager, said: “Supporting parents is crucial in addressing and mitigating adverse childhood experiences because parents play a vital role in shaping a child’s environment and experiences.”\nAs for the children, the programme’s aim is also to provide a secure and nurturing environment for them where they feel secure and accepted, and are heard and understood.\nA recent case that Mr Baculanta encountered is an eight-year-old girl, whose father was put up at a nursing home due to deteriorating dementia. He had shown verbally violent behaviour.\nThe mother, the sole breadwinner in the family, works extra hours at night and during weekends to make ends meet.\nConfused and frustrated by the changes, the girl confided in a CareNights mentor that she had thoughts of self-harm and was curious about a “happy pill” (presumed to be a drug) that she had discovered while watching content fromYouTube.\nThe mentor immediately advised the child’s mother to limit the girl’s access to such online content. After learning about her daughter’s thoughts of self-harm, the mother also communicated the self-harm concerns to the school counsellor.\nEmphasising the importance of having trusted adults in the child’s life to buffer the impact of adverse childhood experiences, Mr Baculanta said: “Currently, the child is thriving and starting to express joyfulness despite her family situation. She feels more confident and secure, knowing that there are people (CareNights’ mentors and volunteers) aside from her family who are concerned for her well-being.”\nDr Fung from IMH said that even with such an ecosystem around a child, and social agencies and organisations may be able to provide tangible help and support, they still cannot provide the love that families can give.\n“There’s a need for love, but love is not something that I can prescribe, though I wish I could,” the child psychiatrist added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- RoundBox@Children's Society (Toa Payoh): 6259 3735 (Mon to Fri, 9am to 6pm)\n- Vox@Children's Society (Chai Chee): 6443 4139 (Mon to Fri, 9am to 6pm)\n- JYC@Children's Society (Jurong): 6566 6989 (Mon, Wed and Fri, 8.45am to 5.45pm)\n- The Fort@Children's Society (Radin Mas): 6276 5077 (Mon to Fri, 8.30am to 5.30pm)"

            "Article Body": "Please be advised that the articles delve into trauma-related topics that may be triggering to the reader.\nSINGAPORE — On Oct 31 in 2000, three-year-old Diyana Amir was at home when the SQ006 plane crash that killed 83 of the 179 people onboard happened.\nHer father Amir Husin, who had been a cabin crew member then, survived the aviation disaster.\nThe ill-fated Singapore Airlines Boeing 747-400 plane carrying 159 passengers and 20 crew members — some of whom were Singaporeans — was to fly to Los Angeles, United States from Taipei, Taiwan. \nDuring take-off at around 11.20pm, the plane hit construction equipment, fell back onto the runway, broke apart and burst into flames.\nFour crew members and 78 passengers died. Another passenger died from severe burns days later.\nThe tragedy would go on to change Ms Diyana’s childhood. \nOnce “the playful parent” she looked to for fun activities, her father became solemn and reserved after that, isolating himself in a room at home most of the time. \nDespite her young age then, she sensed that something had changed drastically.\nNow aged 23, the entertainment producer and filmmaker has written and directed a short film called Paper Planes, Don’t Always Soar — inspired by her childhood experience living with her father’s post-traumatic stress.\nShe told TODAY: “My mother, the only adult at home, and I were constantly vigilant and alert.  \n“We had to halt our daily routines because certain triggers, like the smell of fire or a lit gas stove while cooking, the scent of frangipanis or even my baby brother crying, would set my dad off, leading to anger, irritation or aggression.”\nThe scent of frangipanis was linked to the burial, funerals and deaths of her dad’s friends and colleagues.  \nShe added: “As a child, it took me a while to comprehend and accept the change in him.” \nGrowing up with a parent who was mentally unwell, she recalled the difficult period during her childhood: “Unlike my friends who spent their days playing, I found myself taking a more mature role early, supporting my mother and caring for my little brother. \n“At the time, it felt unfair, a childhood somewhat ‘lost’.”  \nEven though this experience is deeply personal, Ms Diyana’s early struggles with adversity are not uncommon. \nEvery two in three adults in Singapore have experienced at least one adverse childhood experience in their lives before the age of 18. \nThis was among the key findings of a study here published in the Child Abuse and Neglect Journal in 2020 — the first Singapore study on adverse childhood experiences. \nThe study was part of the Singapore Mental Health Study 2016 conducted by researchers at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH).\nThe term “adverse childhood experience” refers to a potentially traumatic situation or event that a person may face or witness while growing up. \nLiving with a household member who is mentally unwell is just one example. \nResearch into potentially traumatic events in childhood has highlighted their far-reaching harmful effects, which may persist well into adulthood. \nHowever, not all types of adverse experiences are obviously traumatic, and not every child is affected in the same way.  \nSome may be able to manage the situation, whereas others require support and help.  \nAdjunct Associate Professor Daniel Fung, chief executive officer of the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), said: “For example, when you’re young and you have an illness that keeps you in hospital for two months.\n\"You recover from the illness but that separation from your family could be quite traumatic, and may have repercussions in the longer term. \n“That can also be considered potentially traumatic although on the surface, it doesn't appear toxic, but that could potentially be a traumatic event.”\nIn the 2016 IMH study, the most prevalent adverse childhood experience reported was emotional neglect. Around 46 per cent of the adult respondents experienced this.\nThis was followed by: \nChildhood emotional neglect is when the child’s emotional needs are consistently overlooked, ignored or not adequately met by their caregivers during the formative years.  \nWhen asked what emotional neglect might look like in families, Dr Fung from IMH said: “In today's Singapore context, it would mean that there might be adults around but they are not providing (love and) care for the child.” \nIn a separate study by the Singapore Children’s Society, which surveyed 270 pairs of caregivers and children from low-income families from 2017 to 2019, the common adverse childhood experiences the children faced were:  \nMs Toh Sze Min, a research officer with the Singapore Children’s Society, said: “As the sample of children were from low-income families, some possible reasons where these adverse childhood experiences were common could be that children from these families might have lived in neighbourhoods that were less safe. \n“They might have been bullied in school because they were not able to fit in with their peers due to the family’s low income. \n“Individuals in multi-stressed populations were more vulnerable and at higher risk of offending behaviours that may lead to (serving time in prison).” \nDr Yeleswarapu Padmini, senior consultant with the department of child development at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH), said that exposure to adverse experiences during the critical early years of life can have significant and lasting effects on cognitive development, and how the person regulates behaviour and emotions.\n“These can contribute to difficulties in learning, social interactions and ultimately, have an impact on educational and employment outcomes in the long term.” \nLeft unchecked, experiencing hardships in childhood can cause toxic stress. \nClinical psychologist Claire Ng said that while some level of stress can be “healthy for development”, stress that is unrelenting, pervasive and overwhelming becomes detrimental. \n“Psychological stress is considered ‘extreme’ when it overwhelms the child’s internal capacity and inner resources to cope,” she added. \nMs Ng is with the department of developmental psychiatry and the forensic rehabilitation, intervention, evaluation and network development services at IMH.  \nLikening extreme stress to a car engine that is revved up for long periods every day, Ms Ng explained: “Eventually, it results in wear and tear that heightens the risk of stress-related physical health issues. \n“This (type of stress) is particularly problematic for children as they are undergoing critical developmental periods. \n“Toxic stress can affect the brain’s developing structure. This means it doesn’t just affect the child’s current well-being, it also has lasting effects on their capacity to tolerate stressors in the future.” \nFor example, children who were maltreated were found to have:\nFindings from research into the long-term health effects are just as troubling. \n“Exposure to adverse childhood experiences increases the chance of health problems in adulthood, ranging from cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune disorders, cancers, mental health problems, among others,” Dr Padmini from KKH said.\nMs Toh from Singapore Children’s Society said that findings from its aforementioned 2017 to 2019 study have shown that children who were exposed to more adverse childhood experiences tended to have “poorer life satisfaction, school engagement and social-emotional competence”.  \nNew research based on a nationwide sample of more than 25,000 pairs of twins in Sweden reinforced this. \nThe Swedish study found that the effects of adverse childhood experience were “dose-dependent”, with each additional adverse experience associated with 52 per cent greater odds of any psychiatric disorder later in life. \nThe study was published in the Jama Psychiatry peer-reviewed journal last month. \nThe IMH study found that experiencing just one adverse childhood experience placed the person at a considerably higher risk (3.7 times more likely) of developing a mood or anxiety disorder, compared to those whose childhood were unblemished by an adverse event. \nThose with an adverse childhood experience was also 4.2 times more likely to have suicidal thoughts, and plan and attempt suicide. \nThe effects of an adverse childhood experience may not end with the victim: Past trauma can affect subsequent relationships and leave an imprint across generations. \nMs Ang Jia Yi, a counsellor at Yishun Family Service at Singapore Children’s Society, said that parents who have experienced childhood trauma themselves may normalise adverse experiences or struggle to recognise that there are healthier alternatives for their children. \n“They may unknowingly perpetuate patterns of trauma within the family and expose their children to similar adversities,” she added. \nDr Fung from IMH said that intergenerational transmission of abuse can result in changed behaviour and perception of what normal relationships are. \n“For example, for someone who has been coercively abused, whether physical or sexual, they may view relationships as centred around satisfying the needs of the more powerful caregiver. \n“When they become caregivers themselves, they may relive that kind of trauma on the next generation, becoming abusers themselves. \n“If you study paedophilia and other kinds of sexual disorders called paraphilias, there often is a history of some level of abuse of a similar nature in the childhood, though not all (have experienced childhood abuse),” he added. \nMs Ng the clinical psychologist wanted to stress that not all abuse victims go on to become perpetrators themselves. \n“Many victims go on to thrive and experience post-traumatic growth (positive changes after exposure to trauma) where they go on to live meaningful lives.” \nNot everyone who has had a rough childhood suffers irreparable damage, but the potential fallout is significant enough such that researchers and experts are working to find ways to mitigate its effects. \nIn Singapore, there are programmes and interventions in place to support traumatised children. (More details will be available in the second part of this series.)\nExperts told TODAY that it is crucial to address adverse childhood experiences and provide appropriate intervention as early as possible. \n“Trauma-focused work with children often requires working close with families and communities. \n“A large part of the work is helping children and families understand the impact of trauma on children,” Ms Ng said. \nDr Fung said that education is key. \nUnderstanding what would potentially traumatise a child and its potential impact are an important preventative step. \nSo is the presence of safe, secure, nurturing relationships in the child’s life, particularly when times are tough. \n“Even if a child has gone through a potentially traumatic situation, providing a safe, secure and nurturing environment is actually protective,” Dr Fung said. \n“Suppose there’s an accident and the child (is the sole survivor). Can you still save the child (from potential long-term effects of trauma)? \n“Yes, you can, if there’s a caregiver who loves them. Maybe a grandparent who can keep them safe, nurture them and help them process what has happened.” \nMr Jeremy Heng, senior clinical psychologist and deputy head of Sunbeam Place at Singapore Children’s Society, a residential home for abused and neglected children, said: “From what we know from research and our work at Children’s Society, the other most important factor is having one consistent safe attachment adult figure, or more, in the child’s life.” \nDespite his mental health struggles after surviving the plane crash, Mr Amir’s love for his family came through later. \nA combination of medical intervention, therapy sessions and unwavering support from family and friends helped him and his family heal. \nMs Diyana said: “There wasn’t a singular defining moment that marked the turning point in my dad’s recovery.\n“Instead, it was more of a gradual realisation, a click of understanding that I had observed in him that resonated deeply with me.\n“Slowly but surely, we began seeing glimpses of his old self returning.” This was about two years after the disaster. \nShe recalled that their relationship improved when she was around five years old.\nIn the short film Paper Planes, Don’t Always Soar, Ms Diyana tried to capture that subtle yet profound shift with a scene of her family huddling together after a storm. \n“It symbolised not just the aftermath of a literal storm but also the emotional and psychological challenges we had weathered together,” she said. \n“It felt as if my dad suddenly saw us and understood that he wasn’t alone, that we were all there, willing to support him through his struggles. \n“That realisation seemed to act as a catalyst for him to begin opening up, allowing himself to be vulnerable and to lean on us as he took steps towards recovery.” \nToday, the family has not just “moved on” from the experience; they grew and became stronger as a unit. \n“My relationship with my dad is better than ever now. It’s evolved into something truly special… open, fun and deeply connected. \n“We enjoy each other’s company and we find joy in the simplest of moments together,” Ms Diyana said.  \nHer father’s battle with adversity shaped her own approach to handling life’s challenges. \nShe recalled feeling scared whenever her baby brother cried because that would trigger her father. She would also put on a brave front and help out at home, such as fold her own school uniform.\nLooking back, she realised that she ended up spending more time at home after the incident, and that made her closer to her mother and little brother. \nShe said that she never felt resentful or bitter. To her, it felt like they were all going through a difficult situation together. \nIt taught her the value of patience and understanding. Instead of reacting impulsively in times of adversity, it was crucial to pause, reflect and look past the surface of the problem, she added. \n“With hindsight, I see the immense impact it had on my personal growth. The experience accelerated my maturity, equipping me with a depth of understanding and empathy that has been invaluable through my teenage years and into adulthood. \n“It taught me to navigate complex situations and understand people beyond the surface,” she said. \nShe also saw how important open communication was in overcoming hard times.  \n“I’ve come to realise that trying to navigate trauma or any problems in isolation only amplifies the pain and can hinder healing. Speaking up and confiding in people I trust has been important. \n“It’s a reminder that sharing our burdens doesn’t make us weaker but opens the door to support and insight.” \nThat was why she made the film. “Making the film was not just a creative outlet for me, but a deliberate effort to communicate and connect (with people) on issues often shrouded in silence. \n“My hope is that by sharing these stories, we can illuminate the shared aspects of our human experience, encourage others to speak up, seek support and find solace in the fact that they are not alone.”\nPaper Planes, Don’t Always Soar will screen at an Institute of Mental Health event next Saturday (April 20) from 10.30am to 12.15pm. \nMs Diyana Amir, Dr Daniel Fung, Ms Claire Ng and other mental health experts will discuss the impact of intergenerational trauma on youth mental health.

            "Article Summary": "People are moving less while obesity rates have gone up, a recent health survey in Singapore found.\nBarriers in modern life, such as having not enough time and a focus on other priorities, make it harder for people to be motivated to exercise.\nFrom an evolutionary point of view, the body tends to take the easy way out to accomplish tasks, an expert said.\nA psychologist and personal trainer gave psychological and practical tips on how to overcome inertia.\nHaving jobs that demand a lot of our time.\nWork-at-home arrangements that limit incidental movement.\nFamily obligations such as caregiving responsibilities.\nFestivities such as Christmas and Chinese New Year that disrupt routines, making it challenging to get back to some form of exercise.\nIndulging in rich foods during major seasonal celebrations can lead to feelings of lethargy and guilt, further deterring motivation.\nIn the pre-modern world, having adequate energy was crucial for survival.\nIn the Paleolithic era (also known as the Old Stone Age), humans endured strenuous labour, using their energy primarily in hunting and gathering.\nThey also rested as much as possible to save up energy for the next round of demanding activities .\nLifestyles have changed in the past 10,000 years from the late Paleolithic era to the present.\nIn modern times, technological advancements have made life more convenient and we no longer move as much for survival.\nHowever, the human body has not adapted at the same pace and still operates according to ancient survival instincts.\nThis tendency to \"conserve energy\" and rest thus makes it challenging to initiate physical activity.\nInstead of rewarding yourself each time you do something good, this method involves delivering reward at irregular intervals.\nMr Boh the psychologist pointed out that the intended effect of not knowing what you may get is why some people become addicted to gambling.\n“They don't get their reward all the time, but it is the thrill of getting a reward, a win, that makes it so addictive.”.\nTo increase motivation for exercise, use the same technique — randomising the chance of a reward.\nFor example, you can tell yourself, ‘After I exercise, I will toss a coin. If it’s heads, I’ll give myself a reward but if it’s tails, then none’.\nThe reward can involve something that you like, such as unwinding with a movie or treating yourself to a small gift.\nOr mix it up with longer-term weekly or monthly goals, and then aim for a larger reward such as investing in new exercise clothing or going for a massage.\nEngage in some positive self-talk.\n“The brain has a way of believing something that you say,” Mr Boh said.\n“With exercise, you don’t have to pretend to like it. But do tell yourself, ‘It’s not easy but I can handle this’.\".\nMr Boh is referring to simple exercises such as brisk-walking or a slow jog, “not Olympic endeavours such as running a marathon or lifting 100kg”.\nEngaging in positive self-talk encourages the brain to continue to sustain effort in doing challenging things.\nWith consistency, exercising can become a habit, akin to brushing your teeth.\n“After exercising consistently for a while, you may notice feeling more energetic, fitter and lighter,\" Mr Chia said.\nExercise provides a dopamine boost, providing an immediate mood boost and sense of accomplishment after a workout .\nDopamine is a hormone and neurotransmitter that plays a role in giving feelings of pleasure, motivation and learning.\nIt may feel frustrating and difficult at first, but the amygdala (part of the brain involved in reward learning and motivation) will slowly create arousal and gradually, the brain will perceive it more positively, Mr Boh said.\nBefore starting an exercise session, visualising a positive outcome can help boost motivation.\nThis may be imagining how good you will feel, eating a healthy meal or getting a deeper post-workout sleep.\n“Mental savouring can increase dopamine for most people, especially for those who are half-hearted about exercise,” Mr Boh said.\nThis may not work for some people who dislike exercising.\nFor this group, visualise what might happen if you continue to remain sedentary and avoid exercise: Getting a stroke or heart attack or cancer.\n“The fear will then nudge them a bit because some people may get motivated by fear, though, it’s not always the best (method),” Mr Boh added  .\nThat generate visible results, usually as part of a structured exercise plan.\nThat the person enjoys such as dancing (cue Madagascar's dance track) or swimming.\nA good rule of thumb is to include structured exercise 80 per cent of the time and activities or sports that you enjoy 20 per cent of the time.\nFor example, play basketball once a week alongside a routine of running or strength training four times a week.\nFor people who like company or socialising, have a workout buddy or sign up for group exercise classes or join a sports club.\nA workout buddy can keep you accountable to your goals .\nFor people who find it hard to be more active due to family obligations, exercise together as a family.\nIt can become time spent to bond, to catch up with each other and share a healthy post-workout meal .\nPrepare to exercise in advance, put it in your diary and choose a convenient location such as a gym or walking route near your home or workplace.\nInvest in simple equipment such as a yoga mat or a set of dumbbells if needed.\nRather than start off with an hour-long session of high-intensity exercise, take small manageable steps with lighter ones first",

And nothing beats some ailments and stress like a good workout, which gives us natural painkillers and mood-boosting chemicals.\nYet, many people are still not moving more or getting enough exercise.\nFitness professional Joel Chia said that sedentarism is a “pandemic”, given that people are moving less. He is a certified personal trainer and senior dietitian at Novi Health, a specialist medical centre that provides personalised solutions to manage chronic health conditions. \nThe National Population Health Survey 2022 released here late last year showed the same thing about physical activity levels.  \nIt found that the percentage of Singapore residents engaging in sufficient total physical activity — say, at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity physical activity — has gone down from 84.6 per cent in 2019 to 74.9 per cent in 2022.\nThis was chalked up to reduced commuting from hybrid work arrangements after the Covid-19 pandemic.\nAt the same time, obesity rates have increased by almost 35 per cent in the past decade — from 8.6 per cent in 2013 to 11.6 per cent for the 2021 to 2022 period.\nSo, what is stopping people from mustering the motivation to exercise?\nVarious barriers found in modern life make it hard for people to carve out the time and will to get moving.\nMr Chia gave some examples:\nRegistered psychologist Gerald Boh said that younger adults, in particular, may have “present bias” — the tendency to prioritise the rewards they can get now over long-term future benefits. \n“If you (tell them) that not exercising increases their risk of cardiovascular disease, a young person may say, ‘I’m still young enough that I can wait’. \n“Younger people will always have other more urgent priorities that they would want to take care of, like career, setting up a family, their finances.\n\"It’s not like they think that health is unimportant but rather, they don’t think it’s urgent enough yet.”\nMr Boh is the clinical director and principal psychologist at Okay-to-Chat, a private mental health service that uses a combination of face-to-face and e-counselling platforms. \nHe is also an exercise psychologist with PsyFit, which uses psychology, counselling and physical activity to improve health.\nPerhaps the most interesting research on why people find it hard to get started on exercise is that your brain is just not wired that way.\nWe want to rest more because it is an evolutionary mechanism.\nAssistant Professor Ivy Yeh from Nanyang Technological University has research expertise in biological anthropology, which is the study of human biological variation and evolution. \nShe and Mr Boh have these to say collectively:\nAsst Prof Yeh believes that chronic and lifestyle-related diseases such as diabetes will become even more prevalent in the next few decades, considering that the modern diet is richer in sugar compared to that in olden times.\nShe said: “Our innate tendency is always to seek the easiest path to accomplish tasks, yet the convenience may not always align with what’s best for health.\n“We may be increasing in lifespan, but more important is our ‘healthspan’ that is the number of years spent living an active lifestyle and doing what we enjoy in old age.”\nNow that we know why exercising — or even just moving more every day — does not come naturally to us, here are some psychological techniques to help increase and sustain motivation.  \nMr Boh advised against setting outcome goals such as “I want to lose weight”.\nInstead, set behavioural goals that are achievable and action-oriented such as \"I will brisk-walk for 30 minutes, five times a week for 12 weeks\".\nCertain types of physical activities tend to boost and sustain motivation, making regular exercise more sustainable.\nThese include exercises:\nHere are some tips from Mr Chia the personal trainer:\n“A partial workout still counts as exercise. Instead of a full hour of exercise, for example, try doing push-ups first thing in the morning,\" Mr Chia said.\n“Don’t count your exercise minutes; make your exercise count.” \nMr Boh emphasised that in getting people to increase their activity levels, “some exercise is better than none”. \n“If you can do more, that’s better. But the main idea is to keep moving because we have to look at physical activity in totality — exercise is just one aspect. \n“If you sit in a chair for 10 hours a day and brisk-walked for 30 minutes, you may gain some benefits from the brisk-walking.\n\"However, certain risks from sitting the whole day may not be remediated. \n“So we encourage people to just move more, without consciously (overthinking) it,” Mr Boh said.

            "Article Summary": "Detecting and treating cancer early improves treatment and survival outcomes .\nHowever, it can take months or even years before the person with cancer experiences any symptoms.\nDepending on various factors, some cancers' symptoms show up early, while others may remain hidden until the disease has spread.\nRegular screening and being alert to persistent or unexplained signs can help identify cancer early, doctors said.\nA 38-year-old told of how her cancer diagnosis was delayed for months because she thought her symptoms were due to stress and anxiety",
            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — It is well known that the earlier cancer is detected, the better chance of treating and surviving it.\nCancer that has spread becomes more complicated to treat, with those in the advanced stages generally having poorer outcomes. \nPeople whose cancer treatment is delayed by even a month have a 6 to 13 per cent higher risk of dying — a risk that continues rising the longer treatment is put off, a study published in 2020 in peer-reviewed medical journal The BMJ suggested. \nAs developed and affluent countries see higher cases of cancer among young people, it is becoming important that this group be made more aware of cancer symptoms so as not to get a delayed diagnosis.\nAs it is, a late diagnosis continues to be the norm in many cases despite advances in medicine. \nFor example, between 2018 and 2021, the majority of lung, stomach and pancreatic cancers were diagnosed in the later stages, based on data from the Singapore Cancer Registry Annual Report 2021. \nEven for colorectal cancer, which is among the most common cancers in Singapore, more than half of the diagnoses were after the disease advanced to Stage 3 and Stage 4.  \nJust how long can someone have cancer without knowing that something is seriously wrong? \nIn conjunction with World Cancer Day that was on Feb 4, TODAY asked doctors why some people may not be aware that some cells in their body have gone rogue, and what are the early signs not to ignore.\nMany factors can affect how early or late the cancer is detected: The type, where it is located, its speed of growth and the uptake for certain cancer screenings, the doctors said. \nDr Melvin Look, medical director of PanAsia Surgery and specialist in gastrointestinal cancer surgery, said that it may take “months or even years” before a person experiences any symptoms. \nHe explained: “All cancers initially start at the microscopic level. Because it’s so small, it’s both asymptomatic (no symptoms) and undetectable. \n“As the tumour slowly increases in size, it may still remain asymptomatic unless a person undergoes special screening tests to look for it.” \nEventually, the cancer grows and progresses to the “symptomatic-detectable” stage, Dr Look said.\n“The symptoms are usually due to the size of the tumour itself, causing a lump that can be painful or painless. \n“The lump can also cause secondary effects like bleeding or blockage of the organ cavity where it is located.” \nFor example, cancer of the upper gastrointestinal tract such as the oesophagus or stomach can cause vomiting, pain or difficulty swallowing.\nAs the cancer spreads to the rest of the body, it can cause symptoms specific to the organ. For example, back pain can be a sign of secondary cancer in the bone, Dr Look added. Secondary cancer is cancer that has spread from where it first originated.\nHow early symptoms show up may depend on where the cancer is located and the speed of growth.\n1. LOCATION OF THE CANCER OR ORGAN \nExplaining why some patients may not feel pain at first even when the cancer is growing, Dr Look said that a cancerous growth starts to cause pain or discomfort only if it invades the nearby nerves or cause a physical compression or obstruction to the organ.\n“If the cancer is in an organ that has a lot of space like the stomach, the mass needs to be very large before it causes symptoms.\n“On the other hand, a very early cancer can become symptomatic if it is located in an area that is visible, such as skin cancers, or they happen to produce alarming symptoms (such as bleeding from the nose in nasopharyngeal cancers),” Dr Look added. \nAnother example of a cancer that is hard to detect early due to its deep-seated location is ovarian cancer.\nDr Samuel Ow, Singapore Cancer Society’s council member and chairperson of the society’s community health committee, explained: “It’s because the ovaries are very small organs floating in the depths of the pelvis.\n“On the internet, you’ll see that many people call ovarian cancer the ‘silent whisperer’, so when the patient is diagnosed with ovarian cancer by the time she has symptoms, it’s often at stage three or four.”\nDr Ow is also a senior consultant with the department of haematology-oncology at National University Cancer Institute, Singapore.\n2. SPEED OF TUMOUR'S GROWTH\nDr Look said that some slow-growing tumours, in the thyroid or prostate for example, can remain asymptomatic for a very long time.\nDr Ow said: “Slow-growing cancers may not just be organ-specific. Even for breast cancer, there are slower-growing types of breast cancer and faster growing types. \n“For example, triple negative breast cancers are more aggressive than mucinous breast cancer and tubular breast cancer, which are very slow-growing.”\nSome people may disregard symptoms due to the mindset that “it won’t happen to me”, Dr Ow said.\n“Young working individuals who are typically healthy and exercise will not be thinking that they develop cancer, but can they happen to them? Yes, of course.” \nCancer was not on 38-year-old Nicole Tan’s mind when she started having unusual symptoms of swallowing difficulties and chest tightness late in 2020. \n“I went for medical check-ups and the doctors didn’t find anything abnormal, so I assumed that it was stress related and attributed it to anxiety. I didn’t think that it (was anything serious) at my relatively young age,” she said. \nBy April the next year, Ms Tan could no longer keep any food down, vomiting whenever she tried to eat and drink. She was rushed to the emergency department. \nIt turned out to be oesophageal cancer. The oesophagus is a long muscular tube that moves food from the throat to the stomach.\n“I was shocked and in disbelief for the first hour or so,” she said of what happened after she learnt of the cancer, which was at stage two or three.\nDr Look, who treated Ms Tan, said that many patients ignore symptoms because they think it is related to something commonplace such as stress or indigestion.\n“Young people, tend to delay seeking medical attention because they wrongly believe that cancer only happens in older people. Unfortunately, the incidence of cancer in younger people are in fact on the rise in Singapore,” Dr Look said.\nFor example, the age-standardised incidence rate of cancer in the 15 to 34 age group rose by more than 40 per cent — from 27 per 100,000 population between 1993 and 1997 to 39 per 100,000 between 2013 and 2017. \nThis is based on figures from the Singapore Cancer Registry 50th Anniversary Monograph. \nSome people have “a fear of knowing” and are in denial about their health concerns, Dr Ow said. \nHe once encountered a patient whose breast tumour grew so large (to about 16cm) that it broke through the skin. \nThe woman, who was in her 60s, said that she thought her skin was red as she had rubbed medicated oil and scratched it. Despite being within the recommended age for breast screening, the woman had never gone for a mammogram. \n“The reason why the cancer was detected was because she developed severe anaemia that made her breathless. Any lay person will know that it’s abnormal, to have something erupt from the breast,” he added. \n“I think deep down inside, these patients know (that something is wrong).\n“For (the breast cancer patient), her husband had passed away from pancreatic cancer a year before. I think that had been a traumatic process for her. \n“I suspect that the condition she faced had occurred while she was caring for her husband as well, so probably she was trying not to deviate from her role as a caregiver.” \nThankfully, not all hope was lost for the woman, whose cancer was at Stage 3. She underwent treatment and surgery.\n“Happy to say that it’s been eight years since, and she remains well,” Dr Ow said.\nIn Singapore, there are national screening guidelines for colorectal, cervical and breast cancer. These are common cancers that have proven screening strategies that affect outcomes.\n“The reason for screening is because we are trying to cause what we call a stage shift,” Dr Ow explained. \n“(Cancer) screening is supposed to try to shift the needle, from a later stage to an earlier stage, with the idea that the treatment for the cancer will become less complicated, potentially cause less burden on the healthcare system and also improve overall quality of life and lifespan.”\nThe doctors also advised people not to ignore symptoms, especially if they have gone on for some time. \n“The key words are ‘unexplained’ or ‘persistent’,” Dr Ow said. \n“If you notice constitutional symptoms (a group of symptoms that affect many body systems) like constantly feeling tired or fatigue, unexplained weight gain or weight loss, feeling bloated, constantly feeling full or having a poor appetite, it may not be a bad idea to get a medical assessment.” \nDr Look pointed out that many early cancers remain in the symptomatic-detectable stage for a long time before they become advanced. \nFor example, in a clinical study he did for his patients with stomach cancer, up to 30 per cent of the early cases remained in this stage for more than a year before they progressed to the advanced stage. When these patients saw Dr Look, they already had symptoms for up to a year. \nThe symptoms for stomach cancer may include indigestion, nausea, vomiting, upper abdominal pain and heartburn.\nUrging patients not to ignore their symptoms, no matter their age, Dr Look said: “The potential window for diagnosis and cure is therefore significant as long as we do not ignore our symptoms.” \nCurrently in remission, Ms Tan wished that she had been more aware of how to care for her health. Her advice to young people is to listen to their body and advocate for their own health, especially if there are suspicious symptoms.  \nBringing up the point that alarm bells may not ring for doctors in general because the prospect of cancer in a younger person was hardly thought of as common in the past, she said: “Do not neglect the early signs, and go beyond the basic check-ups even when doctors may dismiss you because you are a young adult.”\nLearn more about cancer at Our Tampines Hub from 10am to 8pm on Feb 17 and 18.

            "Article Summary": "Members of Parliament from the Government Parliamentary Committee for Health has filed a motion to do more to tackle mental health.\nIt is to call for a whole-of-Singapore effort in advancing mental health and well-being.\nDr Wan Rizal Wan Zakariah from the committee explains why the team has put this up for when Parliament sits the week of Feb 5.\nHe talked about his personal experience of supporting his wife through her postnatal blues and the importance of having a support network.\nHis hopes are that mental health screenings will be the norm one day, and that people have strong links to a caring community with shared interests",
            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — When Dr Wan Rizal Wan Zakariah and his wife had their fourth child in 2017, he thought that he would be better prepared to walk his wife through the throes of postnatal blues.\n“You know, having a fourth child means you’re quite an ‘old bird’ already, lah,” the 46-year-old said, using a term that refers to someone who is well-seasoned. His wife is three years younger than him.\n“You know that your wife will go through postnatal depression probably, and you’re more or less geared up… you know how to help her out,” he continued.\nThe Member of Parliament (MP) for Jalan Besar Group Representation Constituency was speaking to TODAY on Friday (Feb 2) before Parliament sits next week. \nHer condition then had not been medically diagnosed, he added, but even with some experience and preparation, having their fourth child was an especially difficult period for the couple, because his wife’s postnatal blues lasted for six months — much longer than he had expected.\n“And for that whole duration, I think it was quite tough because she was always down. And as much support as I was giving her, I had three other children who also needed their mum.” Their four children are now aged 17, 14, 11 and seven.\n“Under pressure” to care for his wife and young children then, Dr Rizal expressed gratitude to close friends to whom he could confide and be heard.\nWhat helped the family through that period was having a community and strong support network, he remembered.\n“Although I had to really hold the ship together, I was not alone. I had my parents, I had my in-laws and everybody came in and they became a very strong support system, and that’s why I believe strongly in this.\n“If you really want to improve mental health in Singapore, it’s about getting that support network strong.”\nThis is why, together with four other MPs from the Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) for Health — Dr Tan Wu Meng, Mr Yip Hon Weng, Ms Mariam Jaafar, and Mr Edward Chia — he has filed a parliamentary motion to call for a whole-of-Singapore effort in advancing mental health and well-being.\n“The essence of the motion is a heartfelt call for unity in nurturing a society where mental well-being is a shared journey, emphasising compassion, understanding, and collective action for the holistic health of every Singaporean,” he said.\nOn why the team had filed the motion, Dr Rizal said that each committee member had their own areas of interest and collectively brought together a “broad kind of expertise”:\n“For me, it was mental health and… (Ms Mariam’s) in tune with the nuances of the youth, and mental health comes up quite high on the list. Dr Tan Wu Meng, he’s a doctor, so he’s seen his fair share of mental health issues within the community, too.”\n“But if you look across (the board), all of us really believe that mental health is something that is very pertinent… and it has always been an issue deep within our hearts,” he added.\nIn October last year, the Government launched the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy, which aims to build up the country’s mental health ecosystem to offer accessible clinical care to people who need it.\nEven though Dr Rizal believes that the national strategy is a good move “in the right direction”, strengthening the community element would be a key focus for the GPC for Health, because they are looking to build on the national plan.\n“I’m glad that we are all moving in the right direction... it’s all about just refining it. I think the key word I want to use for our motion is that we want to refine. It’s not about revamping a strategy,” he said.\nReferring to the 2012 Community Mental Health Masterplan and the 2007 National Mental Health Blueprint that came before the latest national strategy, Dr Rizal added: “We always, in a way, refresh and update (our approach) simply because of the way our community changes over time, and the nuances need to be adapted accordingly.\n“And for us (in the GPC), many of us have been speaking about this for the longest time, and I thought it was timely that the strategy came out and we are able to further the strategy’s plans.”\nDuring the interview, apart from talking about the motion the GPC had filed, Dr Rizal also spoke about his motivations for being a long-time advocate for mental health.\nRecounting the period when his wife was experiencing postnatal depression after they had their fourth child, Dr Rizal recalled two things they did when his wife was struggling: He taught his three older children to help support their mother, aside from relying on an external network of family and friends for support.\nDr Rizal told TODAY that what really got him interested in the sphere of mental health and well-being was when he was an officer in the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) during his National Service days.\nAttending to suicide calls as an SCDF officer was an “eye-opener” for him, and it made him more cognisant of mental health conditions and how people wanted to be heard.\nSince becoming a parliamentarian in 2020, he has spoken extensively about mental health and well-being, often defaulting to the acronym “LAST”, short for literacy, accessibility, screening and time-outs.\n“If someone were to fall, we know how to provide first aid for the cut, right? You wash, then you put some ointment, and maybe you put a plaster over it.\n“But what if your friend, someone close to you, has a mental health issue that you probably need first aid for and we don’t have that capability?”\nHow society is going to construct that first aid, is an area to delve deeper into, he said.\nSome key hurdles that remain in advancing mental health and well-being in Singapore include overcoming stigma associated with mental health illness, learning to provide support for individuals and their caregivers, and strengthening individuals’ support networks, he added.\nOn how Singapore can specifically “go further” in deepening its strategy, Dr Rizal offered some starting points. They include normalising mental health screenings and expanding one’s mental health networks to include a community with shared interests.\n“If we can equate physical health screening to mental health screening and we make it a norm, I think that would be my greatest dream come true,” he said.\nJust as physical health screenings tell of an ailment or condition, which then allows for directed solutions to be taken to treat it, Dr Rizal hopes that mental health screenings can offer people greater clarity on how they may better their mental health and well-being.\nBesides these, he also expressed his hopes for mental health time-outs to be normalised.\nHe suggested focusing on an added element of “spiritual health”, a topic that emerged in his conversations with the community and engagement sessions with young people.\nNoting that spiritual health was one of seven dimensions of wellness in well-being research, Dr Rizal spoke of the importance of having an “all-encompassing” approach to such healthcare.\nEmphasising that spirituality was not to be conflated with religious faith even if it could encompass it, he instead likened this aspect of spiritual health to having a “certain direction in life based on a certain set of principles” to help one stay on one’s path.\nOn strengthening one’s support network, he spoke of expanding this beyond one’s circle of family and friends to also include building a community that has shared interests.\n“The next frontier is really that: We need an empathetic community that understands mental health, that supports one another, and provides opportunities and platforms to share openly.\n“So one of the things we really feel strongly for is shared spaces — shared safe spaces — and I think it’s very important.”\nThis may be connecting with others through shared interests in gardening, sports, or the arts, he added.\nUltimately, his hope for the mental health landscape in Singapore is to create a community that is resilient, knowledgeable about mental health literacy and, finally, able to apply this knowledge to help one another.\n“And I think the idea is that for those who need help, they’re able to get help without stigma, without fear.”"

            "Article Summary": "A soup-based steamboat dinner may seem like a healthier meal option but it is often laden with calories, saturated fat and sodium .\nPeople may consume as much as 2,000 calories in a single sitting, if they are not mindful of what they take, a dietitian warned.\nOne doctor advised people with pre-existing medical conditions such as hypertension, diabetes and kidney problems to be extra cautious.\nThe experts gave tips on what to avoid when preparing or having a steamboat meal",
            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — In the lead-up to Chinese New Year, families will be making plans for their annual reunion meal and in Singapore, a popular choice is to have a steamboat dinner either at home or an eatery.\nA steamboat or hot-pot meal is a communal dining concept where people dunk raw food items into a boiling pot of soup and then fish them out when they are cooked, to be eaten with dipping sauces and other accompaniments such as rice or noodles.\nNot only is it a cost-effective way to feed a large group of people, cooking an assortment of ingredients in simmering broth is also often thought of as a “healthier” option compared to tucking into greasy, fried dishes at Chinese food places.\nFood that is boiled should be healthy, right?\nWell, that depends on how it is eaten and what else are served on the side, health experts said.\nYes, if one is mindful of what goes into the steamboat dinner, it can be a nutritious balanced meal. \nOn the other hand, a single indulgent steamboat dinner may also easily bust a day’s — or even two days’ — worth of the recommended calorie, fat and sodium intake for each person. \nDr Jonathan Chong from DTAP Clinic at Novena Medical Centre said: “Steamboat meals may not necessarily be as healthy as people think they are. While often seen as a healthier option, they can have many drawbacks and potential health repercussions.” \nDietitian Chloe Ong said that there is often a fine line between what is healthy and unhealthy. \nA principal dietitian at Parkway Cancer Centre, she added: “A steamboat meal can have as low as 400 calories if the person is disciplined and picks more vegetables, lean protein and avoids the oily dipping sauces.\n“But it can have as much as even 2,000 calories if the soup base is oily and the person picks a lot of fatty meat slices and includes dipping sauces such as chilli oil, peanut butter dips and soya sauce, not to mention if there’re also sugary or alcoholic drinks with the hot-pot meal.” \nThe average recommended daily caloric intake for adults is 2,200 calories for males and 1,800 calories for females. \nWhile a single overly indulgent reunion meal is unlikely to result in any serious health repercussions, repeated consumption of steamboat meals may result in the development of chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes over time, Dr Chong said. \nIn particular, people with pre-existing medical conditions such as hypertension, diabetes and kidney issues should exercise added caution when consuming steamboat meals, he added. \n“For individuals who already have such conditions, there may be a worsening of the control over these conditions in the immediate aftermath of such meals. For instance, deterioration in blood sugar control in patients with diabetes, an elevated blood pressure or increase in cholesterol levels.”\nMala broth (1 bowl): 218 calories, 3.6g of saturated fat, 895mg of sodium\nLaksa gravy (1 bowl): 355 calories, 22.6g of saturated fat, 1,500mg of sodium\nClear chicken broth prepared without chicken skin (1 bowl): 113 calories, 1g of saturated fat, 171mg of sodium.  \nTofu with fish paste (1 piece): 63 calories, 0.7g of saturated fat, 71mg of sodium\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following are what to look out for when preparing or having a steamboat or hot-pot meal.\nNot all broths are equal. One of the factors that determines how healthy your meal is the soup base.\n“Some of the broths used are often high in sodium, which can cause an increase in blood pressure and may be associated with the development of hypertension, Dr Chong said.\n“Certain soup bases such as the popular mala broth often contain large amounts of oil and saturated fat, which may in turn be linked to high cholesterol and cardiovascular disease.”  \nMs Ong said that “clear” soup bases that are prepared with some pork ribs or chicken parts are generally healthier and lower in sodium compared to those that use instant stock cubes. \n“If the soup looks ‘creamy’ such as collagen, laksa or mala broth, it may be higher in sodium and saturated fat,” she added. \nFor example, a small bowl of mala broth contains about 220 calories, 3.6g of saturated fat and close to 900mg of sodium, which is almost half the recommended daily sodium limit of 2,000mg set by the World Health Organization.\nCompare this with a bowl of clear chicken soup, prepared without chicken skin: It contains half the calories at about 115 calories, 1g of saturated fat and about 170mg of sodium.  \nTIP: \nDr Chong recommended picking a lighter flavoured, lower-sodium soup base and avoiding drinking too much soup during the meal.\nRefrain from slurping up the broth after many rounds of continuous boiling of meat slices and seafood, even though it looks and smells very flavourful. This is because at that stage, the soup would be even higher in sodium, fat and purines, Ms Ong said. \nPurine is a chemical compound found naturally in some foods that breaks down into uric acid. \n“Prolonged boiling of high purine food would increase the purine content of the soup, which may trigger a gout attack for some people. \n\"At the same time, sodium content is bad for hypertension and the oily soup can also increase bad cholesterol levels while the added calories could contribute to weight gain as well,” Ms Ong said.  \nMs Ong said that the dipping sauces that go with the steamboat meal may also pack a load of unwanted calories and sodium. \n“For example, two tablespoonsful of chilli oil contain about 180 calories, 17g of fat and more than 500mg of sodium. These calories from chilli oil are ‘hidden calories’ that most of us would not be aware of.”\nDr Chong pointed out that many ingredients that are commonly eaten from a steamboat such as fishballs, meatballs and crabsticks are usually highly processed and can contain large amounts of sodium and cholesterol as well. \nFor instance, just three pieces of pork meatballs have around 260 calories, 7.2g of saturated fat, 87mg of cholesterol and 381mg of sodium. \nBy comparison, three slices of lean pork contain 141 calories, 2.2g of saturated fat, 51mg of cholesterol and 45mg of sodium. \nConsumption of processed meats has been consistently linked with higher rates of cardiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes, he said. \n“Some people may think that fishballs, squidballs or prawnballs are pure protein but most of these are usually made of a mixture of starch,” Ms Ong said. \nTIP: Limit the amount of dipping sauce. Instead of dousing an entire slice of meat with sauce, give it a light dip when flavouring your food. \nTry choosing natural aromatics such as chopped fresh garlic or spring onions, freshly diced chilli and lower-sodium soya sauce instead of the usual chilli oil and peanut sauce. \nInstead of placing the processed “balls” and meats immediately into the pot when the soup starts bubbling, start your meal with plenty of fresh vegetables instead before adding leaner cuts of protein.\n“Choose more fresh vegetables, tofu, mushroom and fresh meat such as lean meat, chicken and seafood, rather than processed marinated meats. In that way, we can reduce the intake of sodium and saturated fat,” Ms Ong said. \nIt is easy to overeat when the elders at the table continuously pile food on your plate or egg you to take more food.\nHowever, controlling the amount of carbohydrates consumed in a single meal is especially important for people with a chronic condition such as diabetes, Ms Ong said.\n“(People with diabetes) will need to take note of all the ingredients that they are having and keep to their carbohydrate allowance. \n\"For example, if you (usually) consume a bowl of rice (150g) for dinner, be mindful that at a steamboat meal, there may also noodles, dumplings, yam, corn, etc. So, the rice portion should be cut down accordingly,” she advised. \nTIP: For people on a strict portion control, it might be a good idea to plan in advance. \nOne way to do this is to put aside the carbohydrate food items that you are going to eat, either before or after cooking them in the hot pot, Ms Ong suggested. This is so as not to lose track of how much you have eaten while eating and chatting during the meal. \nWhenever possible, choose wholegrains such as red or brown rice. If there are only white rice and noodles, portion control is still the most important in managing blood sugar levels. Include more leafy vegetables in your meal for added fibre as that would help slow the blood sugar spike, Ms Ong said. \nDr Chong said that a simple way to control meal portions would be to use the Health Promotion Board’s My Healthy Plate guide, which recommends filling half the plate with fruit and vegetables, a quarter with wholegrains and the last quarter with good sources of protein. \nDr Chong said that it is not uncommon for people to experience some gastrointestinal symptoms after overindulging in a steamboat feast. \nFor people who have gastroesophageal reflux disease, a condition in which stomach contents flow back up the oesophagus connecting the mouth and stomach, a hot-pot meal may worsen symptoms such as heartburn and regurgitation.\nHe also said that there is a potential risk of food being undercooked since cooking is done in a communal pot and there is no control over the mix of items placed into the pot at different times.\n“Some families may also inadvertently place raw and cooked food side by side, which poses a risk for cross-contamination,” he added.\nSalmonella and campylobacter bacteria and the hepatitis A and E viruses can cause diseases due to improperly handled steamboat food.\n“Patients with such illnesses typically develop diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and fever, and should seek immediate medical attention should such symptoms arise,” Dr Chong said. \nTIP: If you have gastroesophageal reflux, try to avoid dietary triggers such as spicy and fatty foods that can lead to uncomfortable digestive symptoms. \nBe mindful of how you quench your thirst during a steamboat meal.\n“Carbonated beverages and caffeine-containing drinks such as sodas, colas and iced teas are often consumed together with steamboat meals,” Dr Chong said.\n“Such beverages may also be linked to a worsening of symptoms in some patients with gastroesophageal reflux, and should thus be substituted with safer, healthier alternatives such as plain water.”\nHaving some over-the-counter medications on hand may be helpful.\n“Symptoms (of reflux) can be alleviated with the use of over-the-counter medications like antacids, which usually contain a combination of magnesium, aluminium and calcium compounds.  \n“Such medications neutralise acid and can provide quick relief for symptoms of heartburn,” Dr Chong said. \nIn patients with irritable bowel syndrome symptoms, some studies have found that peppermint oil may potentially be beneficial to reduce post-meal abdominal pain, gas and bloating, he added.  \n“However, should individuals develop more serious symptoms suggestive of food poisoning or food-borne illnesses, such as diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and fever, it would be advisable to not self-medicate but to seek medical attention for further evaluation and treatment, because complications such as dehydration can occur.”"

            "Article Body": "Dear readers, help us make your news reading experience better. We would appreciate it if you could take part in this quick survey. Thank you very much! \nSINGAPORE — As a working adult, Mr Johnny Woo Jia Ying was caught up with getting promoted on the job and accumulating wealth, but surviving a stroke three years ago changed all that.\nNow, the 39-year-old Singaporean’s resolution for the new year is simply to “stay alive” and be in good health.\nIn March 2021, a blood vessel in his brain ruptured while he was having a staycation in a hotel here.\nIt was a haemorrhagic stroke and he was 36 at the time. \nDoctors told TODAY that the incidence of stroke in younger and middle-aged adults has gone up. \nRecounting how his life changed drastically after this health setback, Mr Woo now wants young people to know that strokes can happen at any age.  \n“Please don’t think a stroke won’t happen to you just because you’re young. \n“That’s what I thought, too, that a stroke is something that happens only later down the road, but who knew that I would get it before 40?” he said, adding that the stroke was a big wakeup call for him to focus on his health.\nBefore the stroke, he was not paying attention to his health — he had high blood pressure, led a fast-paced lifestyle and loved to drink alcohol.\n“Do I have regrets? Of course. But for now, I have to move on,” he said. \nThree years after the stroke, Mr Woo still has some weakness and numbness on the right side of the body and some trouble recalling certain things. He works as an executive at a statutory board.\nSinging and running marathons — two activities that he used to love doing — are no longer possible. \n“I used to wish for promotions, to earn more money — those were all very standard and cliched (goals).\n“But since having a stroke, I just want to stay alive and keep healthy, as well as for everyone around me to be healthy,” he said. \nThere are two main types of strokes:\nYoung and middle-aged adults may think that they are safe from strokes.\nHowever, it can happen at any age and figures show that it is affecting more young people.\nReferring to the latest data from the Singapore Stroke Registry Annual Report published in November 2023, Dr Alfred Seng said that although the number of young stroke patients are relatively small compared to those aged 60 and above, their rates have risen over the years.\nFor example, in the 40 to 49 age group, the incidence rate of stroke increased from 73.4 to 97.5 per 100,000 population — a 33 per cent rise — over 10 years (from 2011 to 2021).\nFor those in Mr Woo’s age group (30 to 39 years), the stroke incidence rate rose by almost 50 per cent, from 17.8 to 26.4 per 100,000 population over the same period. \nDr Seng is a stroke rehabilitation consultant at Tan Tock Seng Hospital and is an executive committee member of the Singapore National Stroke Association.\nThe association is a support network for stroke survivors and caregivers. It supports more than 800 stroke survivors, of whom 28 are aged 40 and younger. \nThe youngest member is 22 years old, Dr Seng said. \nDoctors said that the main reasons for the increase are linked to risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension (high blood pressure), hyperlipidaemia (high blood cholesterol) and obesity. Most of these, though, are modifiable with lifestyle changes or treatments that control the conditions. \nDr Kaavya Narasimhalu, consultant with the National Neuroscience Institute, where Mr Woo was admitted to the intensive care unit, said that more people now have such risk factors at a younger age. \nIn younger adults, the biggest risk factor for a stroke is hypertension, followed by smoking, she said. \nResearch shows that uncontrolled high blood pressure increases the risk of stroke by four times. \nThose who smoke 20 cigarettes a day are also six times more likely to have a stroke compared to a non-smoker, the World Stroke Association states. \nMisguided fears about taking medication for chronic conditions may mean that some patients are not getting the treatment they need to control stroke risk factors.  \nDr Kaavya said: “I think many people here have this fear of taking medicine. \n“They may think ‘I have hypertension (but) it's not causing me any problems, so I'm not going to deal with it’. \n“They just don't want to know, and even if they know that they have a (medical condition), they don't want to treat it. That's a big problem.” \nShe added: “It's a bit foolhardy to say, ‘I know my blood pressure is high but I'm not going to do anything about it’. \n“You always want to prevent (strokes) rather than treat them when they happen.”\nA stressful lifestyle is also a possible stroke risk.\nIn a study published in the medical journal Jama Network Open in 2022, psycho-social stress reported by patients within the previous 12 months before a stroke happened were associated with an increased risk of haemorrhagic or ischaemic stroke.\nReferring to the study, Dr Zhao Yi Jing, a neurologist with Zhao Neurology and Headache Clinic in Mount Elizabeth Hospital, said that stress can cause changes in the body and lead to the development of cardiovascular diseases such as an increase in blood pressure.\n“Stress can also cause inflammation in the body, which can lead to a build-up of plaque in the arteries and increase the risk of a stroke,” she said. \nDr Kaavya said that stress could also be an indirect risk factor for strokes. \n“When we're stressed, we may do things that are not great for us, like smoke, drink or eat fatty food,” she said. \nMr Woo believes that he might have been a ticking timebomb since 2015. \nBack then, a health check for a separate medical condition revealed that he had high blood pressure, but he did not follow up on his abnormal blood pressure reading. \n“I didn’t like to go for medical check-ups,” he said. \nBesides his love for heavily salted foods such as sausages and pork knuckles, Mr Woo also loved drinking alcohol. \nHe used to be easily anxious and stressed, which he believed contributed to the stroke. \nSeveral days before it struck, Mr Woo had headaches but he attributed the symptom to a tiring day at work. \nHe was having a staycation with his wife when he started experiencing drowsiness, weakness in his limbs on the right side and difficulties typing. \n“Even then, I convinced myself that I was simply tired,” he recalled. \n“But when I tried to stand up, my right leg gave way and I collapsed. By then, I could not speak.” \nMr Woo’s wife Koh Yu Fang, 34, who works in a treasury, said that she knew a stroke had occurred when she saw that his face drooping and she immediately called the ambulance. \n“I’m not working in the medical field but I’d have to thank the Health Promotion Board and the media for educating me on stroke signs.\n“The medics and doctor said that luckily, I reacted fast (and called for an ambulance),” she added.\nWhen treating a stroke, time is of the essence. “Brain cells begin to die when they are deprived of oxygen,” Dr Zhao explained.\n“If the person reaches the hospital’s emergency department within hours of the symptom onset, early treatment can be instituted, which may reduce the severity of the stroke,” Dr Seng said. \nDr Kaavya said that in ischaemic stroke patients, there is a narrow window — about 4.5 hours — in which medication can be given to try to dissolve the clot that is blocking the blood vessel. \nFor haemorrhagic strokes, the aim would be to bring down the blood pressure as fast as possible to lessen the bleeding in the brain.\n“Most times with strokes, unless you’re within that window period, there’s not much to do to reverse it once it has happened. \n“So, the best way to do anything about (stroke) is to prevent it,” Dr Kaavya added. \n“A lot of the rehabilitation work in stroke is training other areas of the brain that are not affected to take over the work of what is already affected.” \nA stroke is an emergency because more than a million brain cells die every minute that it goes untreated.\nLearn to spot the signs with the FAST method:\n\n\n\n\nAlthough younger survivors show more potential for better recovery compared to older ones, they have a harder time getting used to a different way of life after a stroke. \n“Younger adults are in the productive stages of their lives — starting and building their families and careers, “ Dr Seng said.\n“They also have important roles to play as spouses or parents and to support their dependents.”\nDepression occurs in about a third of stroke survivors at any one time — and the mental health condition is associated with poorer function post-stroke and higher mortality, he added. \nGetting in touch with patient support groups such as the Singapore National Stroke Association can be helpful. \nDr Kaavya said: “Young people generally do better than older people in terms of recovering from a stroke. But then, take into account that they would have their residual disability for many more decades compared to an older person.” \nPost-stroke, about 30 per cent of patients will have cognitive symptoms, she added. \nThese can range from mild cognitive impairment to dementia, affecting many aspects of life such as memory, thinking, planning, language and attention span. \nMr Woo underwent months of rehabilitation to re-learn how to speak, eat, walk and use the bathroom independently. \nHe continues to experience side effects. For example, he now takes a longer time to memorise things and speaks more slowly. \nDue to numbness of his vocal cords, he can no longer belt out his favourite songs. He can no longer run. Heavy lifting is also out of the question.\nVisibly emotional when he talked about the things he can no longer do, he said: “I tell my friends that I’m now half a man.\n“As the man in the household, I’m supposed to lead, but because of (the side effects from stroke), I can’t do certain things. So it feels like I’m not a complete man.\n“For example, I can’t lift heavy things. I feel bad that my wife has to take on that role. Sometimes, I will still help as much as I can with my left arm.” \nMdm Koh does not feel the same way and always tells her husband not to think like that. On his recovery, she said: “With love and patience, nothing is impossible.”\nDespite the setback, what has gone well was that Mr Woo turned his lifestyle and diet around. \n“When I woke up in intensive care, I told myself, ‘No more alcohol’,” he said.\nHe now has a healthy, balanced diet and tracks his blood pressure regularly. \nHe has also learnt to better manage his emotions.\n“When things were not in my way, I used to get easily frustrated and angsty. \n“Now I’m a lot calmer; I even feel it in my brain because... my head now feels a lot less ‘tight’.”\nBesides having a caring spouse and family, he attributed his recovery to a supportive boss and early return to work. \n“Working required me to remember things, so that definitely kickstarted my brain and helped with my recovery.” \nMr Woo also has another wish for the year: To start a family. \n“We had to postpone many things after the stroke episode. Now, my wife and I are trying for a baby. Hopeful for a (Year of the Dragon) baby,” he said, referring to the zodiac animal for Chinese New Year in 2024."

            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — When disappointment, failure, sadness and loss hit all at once, being grateful, or feeling any positive emotion, may be the last thing on your mind.\nJust ask Ms Eva K Peters, who experienced several setbacks in the past year.\nBesides having to come to terms with missing out on an award that she had expected to receive, the postgraduate at the Singapore Management University (SMU) was grieving when her grandmother died earlier this year.\nWhat lifted her from the doldrums eventually was when she looked on what had happened through the lens of gratitude. \n“Mind you, I am still not happy about not receiving the award — and that’s okay, and an appropriate emotion to have in this context. I am nonetheless thankful for the insight that I gained about myself and my personal and professional aspirations through failure,” she said, rather than focusing on it being an outcome of her own insufficiency or incompetence.\nA Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) candidate in organisational behaviour and human resources whose dissertation centres around mindfulness, Ms Peters started developing this “skill” of being grateful regularly in 2019 after becoming a certified yoga teacher.\nGratitude is a quality one can possess and it can be cultivated by recognising and appreciating the different aspects of life.\n“When I began my PhD that focuses on mindfulness, I also read about the beneficial effects of gratitude practice from a research scientific perspective,” she said.\n“I think that was an additional motivation for me to incorporate gratitude practices in my life more intentionally.”\nSo even though Ms Peters cried and mourned the loss of her 93-year-old grandmother, one thing she felt grateful for was the memory of the good times they had together and the years they spent in each other's company.\nShe said that gratitude has also helped her to better navigate failures and disappointments.\n“I feel that by practising gratitude, we can have a richer experience of life because we can see both the negative and positive sides of all that happens to us.”\nThere are many proven health benefits to feeling grateful and expressing gratitude. It is the key to a happier and healthier life, and helps one bounce back from adversity.\nProfessor Jochen Reb, a professor of organisational behaviour and human resources at SMU’s Lee Kong Chian School of Business, said: “Gratitude is a well-researched emotion and it’s clear that experiencing it brings both mental and general health benefits, including positive affect and lower stress.”\nHe is also the founding director of the Mindfulness Initiative @ SMU, which was started in 2013 to support research in educational and outreach projects on mindfulness, with programmes that are open to the general public and corporate organisations.\nMs Peters said that people who are grateful are generally healthier than those who are not. They also experience less stress, sleep better and have better self-esteem and interpersonal relationships.\nAdjunct Associate Professor Angie Chew, founder and chief executive officer of Brahm Centre, a mental health charity dedicated to promoting happier and healthier living, said: “If you really have gratitude imbued in you, then you would be a happier person because you don't take things or people for granted.”\nShe is a certified mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) teacher as well as a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy course teacher. \nMindfulness is the awareness of one’s internal states and surroundings. To be mindful means to be fully present, aware of where one is and what one is doing at the moment without judging or being overly reactive. \nOn the flipside, a lack of gratitude can contribute to negative mental health outcomes, Ms Peters said.\nFor example, there may be more frequent experiences of negative mood, a generally negative mindset, social isolation and increased stress.\n“Someone who lacks gratitude may be prone to focus on what’s missing in their life, as opposed to what they already have. This may contribute to a general sense of discontentment, which can negatively affect one’s mental health,” she added.\nIn the spectrum of human experience, anyone can be grateful or feel grateful. Prof Reb said that it is “part of our innate emotional repertoire”.\nHowever, feeling and expressing the emotion may not come easily to some people. \nCulture, family environment and life circumstances play a role.\nFor example, if the behaviour was not modelled in the family or the environment in which the person grew up, it may be harder for the person to enact it, Ms Peters said.\nElaborating on this, Prof Reb said: “First, we humans learn a lot socially by imitating those around us. \n“Thus, when children grow up in families where their parents practice appreciation and expressing gratitude, this will shape them. \n“In contrast, when children grow up with a sense of entitlement, they might feel less gratitude.”\n“Second, and interestingly, some people come to gratitude through adversity. By experiencing or witnessing hardship, they come to appreciate more the little things in life.”\nThere had been research on this, such as a paper published in the Social Psychological and Personality Science journal in 2014, which looked at nearly 15,000 adults and the researchers found that people who had dealt with more adversity or setbacks in the past reported an elevated capacity to appreciate life’s simple pleasures. \nIn Singapore, Adjunct Assoc Prof Chew observed that Singaporeans generally have difficulty expressing gratitude and appreciation for others.\n“We find it difficult because it is not a habit we have developed. I don't think people generally express gratitude as much; even saying ‘thank you’ is not very commonly practised,” she said.\nA fast-paced lifestyle can also get in the way of experiencing or showing gratitude.\n“In my experience, a key obstacle is our business. We are often too busy working off items on our to-do list, doing chores or chasing our goals to stop and feel grateful,” Prof Reb said.\nMs Chang Ching Chen, an MBSR teacher with the Mindfulness Initiative @ SMU, explained that the brain is “wired in a way that makes people tend to go into auto-pilot mode to achieve maximum efficiency”.\nShe said that it can be difficult to put gratitude into words or practice because that will require one to slow down.\n“We may be rushing from task to task without allowing ourselves to engage with our body sensations, emotions and others. In the long run, (this) may make us appear entitled and ill-mannered,” Ms Chang said.\nMs Peters believes another reason could be that people have difficulty connecting to their emotions. \n“Today’s world is very ‘head-centred’, meaning that we place a lot of value on thinking, reasoning and information processing.\n“The fact that so much funding money is going into the creation of businesses powered by artificial intelligence — which one could argue is most related to our cognitive, information-processing version of intelligence rather than emotional intelligence — reflects the value we place on cognition as compared to emotion as a society.”\nFrom a young age, people across the globe are being trained and educated to develop their cognitive skills, Ms Peters added.\n\"Socio-emotional skills are a focus of education to a much smaller extent, even though this is slowly changing now. \n“The point is that our society, globally, I would argue, has not been placing much emphasis on emotions, identifying them, understanding them and expressing them.\n\"That is one reason why it may be hard for people to feel and, in a second step, show gratitude.”\nThe good thing is, it is possible to train the mind to experience and express gratitude more easily, much like improving on a skill or training the muscles to become stronger.\nMs Peters said: “Experiencing gratitude has a reinforcing effect. In that sense, the more gratitude we are able to experience in a given moment, the more likely we are going to experience more gratitude in the future.”\nAdjunct Assoc Prof Chew pointed out that all habits can be learnt. This applies to gratitude as well.\n\"For example, just because we paid for something, we feel like we don't have to say ‘thank you’, we just take it and walk off,\" she said.\n\"If we want to cultivate gratitude, that it becomes a habit, then I think we all have to consciously show appreciation.”\nThat means saying a word of thanks to the service provider.\n“Words mean something and they evoke a certain feeling. For example, if you complain about something, it evokes a feeling; if you don’t complain, then that feeling isn’t evoked. \nSimilarly, if you don't say 'thank you', then you don't evoke gratitude,” Adjunct Assoc Prof Chew added.\nWith regular practice, feeling and showing gratitude can get easier over time. Here are some tips from the experts.\n1. SLOW DOWN\nCultivating gratitude can be hard when one is rushing around to complete tasks.\nBefore you can count all your blessings, slowing down is necessary. “Pause, take a mindful breath,” Ms Chang suggested.\n2. THINK OF THINGS TO BE THANKFUL FOR EACH DAY\nNext, focus on what you are grateful for.\nAs part of the mindfulness-based programmes offered at the Mindfulness Initiative @ SMU, participants learn a practice called “three good things”, Prof Reb said. This involves bringing to mind three good things that have happened to them.\n“This can be little things, such as a cup of coffee, hearing a bird sing or the smile of another person,” he said.\nAt Brahm Centre, participants are taught the daily “10 finger gratitude practice”, a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy practice that involves recognising that you are grateful for 10 things and people in life. Count them.\nSuch practices help people to refocus on what they have instead of what they lack.\nAdjunct Assoc Prof Chew explained: “The mind, by default, is always looking out for what we lack, is missing, faulty and threats.\n“By doing this, it helps the mind not to stay in the default mode.\n“We train the mind to be grateful and be in the present, so you don’t keep ruminating about the past, worrying about the future — that’s how you lead a happier life.”\n3. ACT ON IT\nBesides developing a habit of practising gratitude by bringing to mind the things to be thankful for, Prof Reb suggested a step further: Turn feelings of gratitude into a behaviour by showing appreciation to someone to whom you feel grateful.\nFor example, tell them how much you appreciate them, he said.\nWriting a thoughtful letter to express gratitude is another way to increase feelings of gratitude while letting the other person feel appreciated.\nIn a study published in the American Psychologist in 2005, writing and delivering a detailed Gratitude Letter showed the positive impact on happiness one month later.\nStudy participants who personally delivered and read the letter to the recipient, rather than just mailing it, reaped the greatest benefits.\nIt may be tough but it is possible to still find moments to be grateful for even when facing severe hurt or betrayal.\n“Cultivating gratitude is not about suppressing or trying to replace negative emotions,” Ms Peters said.\n“It also does not mean that one negates the pain or finds a way to justify the hurtful actions or events.\n“Rather, it is about allowing oneself to experience gratitude alongside the negative emotions associated with the event.”\nIt must be emphasised that feelings of gratitude should not be forced.\nProf Reb said: “You don’t need to feel obligated or force yourself to feel grateful towards someone or something that hurt you.\n“Instead, you could feel grateful towards things that helped you through difficult times, such as the presence of family and friends, your own resilience.\n“When you are ready, you could consider practising another emotion that has shown to have health benefits — forgiveness.\n“But again, you need not force it.” \nWhat about dealing with another person’s entitled and ungrateful behaviour?\nAdjunct Assoc Prof Chew has this advice: Accept it.\n“Acceptance is what you can do because it's not up to us to go and change other people,” she said.\nProf Reb said that there is little direct control over other people’s emotions.\n“If we require someone to be grateful, quite likely it will not be an authentic feeling of gratitude, just an act.\n“Instead we can focus on ourselves by setting a good example. When others see that feeling grateful makes us happy, they might imitate us,” he said."

            "Article Summary": "Exposure to disturbing news events can leave children feeling anxious and fearful.\nThis writer’s young daughter had anxiety attacks after overhearing a family discussion on negative world news.\nMental health experts gave some advice on how to keep young children informed of current affairs without traumatising them",
            "Article Body": " \nScrolling through news headlines and social media, the world often seems like a scary place: People doing risky things that could harm themselves, sexual predators, mass shootings, hate crime, wars and the possibility of human extinction due to climate change and environmental disasters. \nIf such grim world events are anxiety-inducing even for adults, what more children? \nAs parents, even though our instinct is to shield our children from bad and harmful things, living in a world with unfettered access to unfiltered information means that they will inevitably be exposed to such news at some point during their growing years. \nWhen that happens, what can parents do to help their children process it? \nSeveral months ago, I learnt a lesson the hard way when my younger child — aged nine at the time — went into an anxiety spin.\nThe trigger? A conversation that my husband, our 16-year-old daughter and I had after learning that Japan was releasing radioactive water from its Fukushima nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean.\nSomehow, our discussion took a dark turn. We started imagining all sorts of hypothetical scenarios on how life might end on Earth. \nAt one point during our conversation, I made an offhand comment: “If there’s a zombie apocalypse, I don’t think we can survive.” \nTo us, it was just chatter over the dinner table, but for my nine-year-old child, she was looking increasingly anxious and panicky by the minute. \nOur conversation stopped when she burst into tears and screamed at us to stop frightening her.\nMy girl’s emotional state went downhill from there. \nFor weeks, she ruminated over what we had discussed and refused to eat seafood.\nWhen pressed to share her feelings, she would tear up and say: “Is the world going to end because we do bad things to the environment?”\nI could not alleviate her anxiety even when I explained that we were merely discussing something hypothetical, something that was based on possible ideas or situations rather than real ones.\n“But humans are destroying the environment, right?” she said several times when I tried to reassure her.  \nAs my child’s anxiety went on for weeks, I bitterly regretted not considering how she would digest the news and gloomy topic, given her age and sensitive temperament.\nAfter speaking to mental health experts, I learnt that while it is not wrong to keep children informed of what is happening around them and the world at large, one needs to be mindful of how the news is shared with them.\nA lot would depend on their age and level of development and maturity.\nIt also means that negative news shared with a primary school-going child should be very different from that shared with a 16-year-old. \nDr Lim Boon Leng, a psychiatrist with Dr BL Lim Centre for Psychological Wellness who treats children, youth and adults, said that young minds might find it challenging to differentiate between an event happening miles away and immediate personal danger. \n“We must be careful not to overexpose young children to upsetting news that could create a sense of fear and insecurity about the world.” \nHe pointed out that teenagers can handle more complex news and engage in discussions about socio-political causes and effects of such events, but a younger child may have difficulty making sense of the details. \n“When discussing negative news with a nine-year-old or someone younger, it’s important to focus on instilling values such as compassion and significance of helping others, rather than going into the grim details of the events.\n“On the other hand, discussing negative news with a teenager provides an opportunity to encourage critical thinking and awareness regarding world affairs.” \nMr John Shepherd Lim, chief well-being officer of the Singapore Counselling Centre, said that it is more appropriate to share negative news with children who are seven years old and above — with the appropriate guidance and context. \nAt that age, they are better able to discern what is real and fake, as well as the probability of situations or crises happening to people around them. \nHe explained: “According to (Jean) Piaget’s stages of development, from two to seven years old, children are developing abstract thinking — such as thinking about the past or future instead of what is happening before them in the present.\n“However, their way of thinking is still considered egocentric, so they are unable to understand that others think differently from them or that events going on around them are not related to them.” \nSwiss psychologist Jean Piaget was known for his work on child cognitive development.  \nEven among children of the same age, Mr Lim said that every child may have different responses to “scary” world news because they may process information and emotions differently. \nFor instance, children with attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) may tend to fixate on the events and struggle to let go of their emotions.\n“Therefore, it is important to be aware of the changes in the child’s behaviour before and after exposure. \n“Children can experience intense negative emotions such as stress or anxiety from learning about the events, because they may be afraid that it can happen to their loved ones,” Mr Lim added.\nIf the child continues to show signs of anxiety and distress and has trouble going about his or her daily activities, consider seeking professional help. \nEven though my daughter may seem old enough to understand what she heard when we talked about the bad news, Dr Lim said that her fearful reaction suggested that she may not yet be emotionally or cognitively equipped to handle complex global issues at her age. \n“While children do develop empathy at this age, they often lack the necessary context to fully comprehend intricate issues, which can lead to increased anxiety. \n“Therefore, it is crucial to reassure her and provide a sense of hope and security,” he advised. \nHe recounted encountering an eight-year-old boy who developed severe anxiety, nightmares and fears of dying after being exposed to scenes of patients dying in hospital and body bags in other countries during the Covid-19 pandemic. \nThe exposure, together with overhearing his parents discussing their fears of dying from Covid-19, heightened his anxiety.\n“A delicate balance is required in managing a child’s exposure to negative news,’ he added. \n“We may have to be mindful about not exposing children to potentially traumatising information, but they should also not be overly sheltered, resulting in ignorance or absence of a sense of caution. \n“Having a balance helps nurture well-informed, resilient individuals who are aware of the world, but not burdened by its complexities beyond their cognitive ability.”\nMr Lim from Singapore Counselling Centre said that parents may guide conversations on negative news by answering questions that their child has without over-explaining the details. \nAcknowledge the child’s fear and anxiety, and let the child know that it is normal to feel that way, he advised.\nIt is also important for parents who feel anxious or fearful about stressful or tragic news to help their children understand that their own feelings are not directed at the children.\nExplain in simple terms, for example, “I’m worried because people that we do not know are getting hurt”, Mr Lim suggested. \n“Parents can also stick to routines as much as possible to ensure that their child feels a sense of security despite their turbulent feelings.” \nDon’t neglect to share good or light-hearted news with your child. For example, news about people saving others.  \nTalking about what the child can control in their situation to help others is helpful as well, Mr Lim said. For example, making donations or taking part in recycling efforts. \nDr Lim said that focusing on what one has control over is a powerful tool in managing anxiety, especially in a world that can often feel unsettled and unpredictable. \n“When we guide children to concentrate on positive actions, such as contributing to a cause, we help them develop resilience,” he explained. \n“It’s about shifting from a passive to an active mindset, showing children that while they may not be able to change everything, they can make a difference in their own way.\n“This not only helps them cope with anxiety, but also builds a sense of responsibility, self-efficacy and empowerment.” \nLooking back at the conversation I had with my husband and older daughter, the words we had used such as “radioactive fallout” and “nuclear disaster” — without given the full context of the matter — would have painted a terrifying picture in my younger girl’s mind. \nDr Lim said: “It is important to communicate with the child in a way that matches her level of maturity, using familiar and relatable context to make it easier for her to grasp the situation.”\nTelling her not to worry or over-think did not help. What I found helpful was to give her age-appropriate facts and a bit more context of what we had discussed.\nFor example, we explained the reasons why the wastewater had to be dealt with that way and what the authorities said about the plan.  \nWe also took the chance to introduce the concept of radioactivity in simple terms. For example, how people are exposed to radiation from natural sources in everyday life such as sunlight as well as naturally occurring radioactive materials in the ground, soil and water. Some food items such as bananas, Brazil nuts and potatoes are also naturally radioactive. \nOn my part, I also learnt to be more mindful about what and how I talk about current affairs and news when my younger child is around. No more flippant doomsaying. \nHer anxiety gradually abated. \nRecently, I asked her if she still wanted to know what was happening around the world and how I should tell her without terrifying her. \nShe said: “I want to know. But just don’t start off talking about a zombie apocalypse, okay? How can anyone not panic about that, Mum?” \nRight. Guess I’ll just keep my walking dead theories to myself and stick to facts. "

            "Article Body": "If you looked up the phrase \"going hard\" on Urban Dictionary, you'd probably find a picture of my face.\nAt age 19, before I had even officially received my diploma, I started working my first full-time job in advertising while doing my degree part-time. My days were spent working insane hours, going to class, partying late into the night, taking naps and hitting the gym, before going to work and beginning the cycle all over again. \nUnsurprisingly for someone who can't sit still, I love sports. Boxing, bouldering, surfing, diving, hiking — if it doesn’t involve a racquet, I’m into it. \nBut most of all, I love football — not just for the technicality and complexity of the game, but also the camaraderie. My teammates and I have made promises that we would play together until we’re in our 60s. \nIn order to improve and play injury-free for longer, I invested in personal training sessions followed my trainer's online programme for years. You’d usually see me in the gym for three to six hours a week. The difference my efforts made were undeniable: After a few months on this regime, I was hitting personal bests on every lift. \nThen, it came to October this year. After over 13 years of non-stop hustling, I was finally on sabbatical from work.\nI was at my strongest and healthiest. My mental health was the best it's been in years. To top it all off, I was now married to my dream guy! \nAll the pieces of my life had finally fallen into place. I was happy; more importantly, I was hopeful for what I thought to be a bright future ahead. \nI was walking home after football one day, and, without any warning, my right knee just buckled. Right away, I knew something was deeply, chillingly wrong.\nAs I lay still in an MRI scanner, the worst-case scenario in my mind was a torn medial collateral ligament (MCL) — a short-term problem that can typically be fixed with surgery and diligent rehabilitation. But days later, when I hobbled into the doctor's office to receive my results and saw the concern in his kind eyes, I knew I was in for a rough ride. \nBeing diagnosed with bilateral patellofemoral osteoarthritis at age 32 is pretty damning. Most people with this condition are over the age of 50, and the usual prognosis would be to do a double knee replacement surgery and to give up contact sports. \nAfter my consultation, I sat in the car and cried for a long while. I’m too young to switch out contact sports for swimming! I’m too young for osteoarthritis!\nI’ve been 165 cm tall since I was 12 years old. At my lightest, I was 46 kg and at my heaviest, I was 75 kg. Pretty drastic, I know.\nI grew up in the era of Keira Knightley and Kate Moss, but my genetical make-up is more \"Trim and Fit Club\". Fellow millennials will know TAF Club really meant FAT Club, where we were taught that if we wanted to lose weight, we had to eat less and run more. \nThe more I ran in school, the more I realised I could actually run pretty fast. In a way, I was happily surprised: My body was good at something! \nI started receiving compliments on my weight loss. This spurred me to keep piling on the runs, always going faster and longer — all while subsisting on a diet of salads. \nBy the time I was 16, I was running an average of 10 to 20 km a day, with no proper training, footwear, recovery or nutrition. \nOne day, 3 km into a casual jog, my knees buckled. Afraid to find out what it meant, I avoided seeing a doctor and also stopped running altogether. \nThat was the point at which the cartilage in my knees begun to degrade. And I wouldn’t find out for another decade.\nI am proof that body dysmorphia and eating disorders aren’t just mental health conditions. They also have a long-lasting, possibly permanent impact on our physical health. \nUpon getting diagnosed, I had only one goal in mind: To get back onto the football pitch as soon as humanly possible.\nWithin a week, I’d completed a bilateral arthroscopic debridement, chondroplasty and meniscus repair with the help of my doctor, Dr Gurpal Singh. \nBy the second day I was doing pull-ups and had walked over 1300 steps, feeling very proud of myself for being able to move and shower independently. \nOn the third day, in the midst of making the arduous preparations now required for me to undertake a simple shower, it suddenly hit me that I was just at the starting line, and the road to rebuilding my strength and stamina from scratch is a long one. \nI cried again.\nIt took me a while to process and embrace the full spectrum of my feelings. Hours in therapy has enabled me to acknowledge the beauty of being human: We are complex and messy. The sooner we learn to be comfortable with being uncomfortable, the more wholeheartedly we can live.\nA week after my operation, a vase I'd ordered for a friend arrived — coincidentally enough, with its legs broken. I decided to order a separate Kintsugi set and attempt to fix the vase on my own. \nIt’s messy and it’s not perfect — but it holds up, and my friend loves it. \nFor me, this was an encouraging reminder that perfection is overrated, and that while my body may never be back at 100 per cent, a new beauty can emerge from the mess. \nI may not be able to play three matches in a row ever again, but I don’t have to give up on football, and total knee replacement is not inevitable. \nI’ve started sessions at Physio Circle. Their philosophy is “No last game”, which I've taken to heart. I recently managed my first push-ups in nearly a month, and I’m once again looking forward to the future. \nSlowing down has also given me the chance to finally start the podcast that's been on my to-do list for years now, titled Naked.Graced, where I'm excited to share my ugly, uncomfortable, authentic stories that will hopefully resonate with my fellow human beings. \nI have no idea what the future holds, but I know that it’s going to be worth it.\n \nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\nGrace Ke, 32, is an aspiring podcaster who founded her mental health podcast Naked.Graced."

            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — Whether it is groin discomfort, a burning sensation when urinating or trouble maintaining an erection, there are some below-the-belt symptoms that should not be ignored, even in younger men. \nIn conjunction with men’s health awareness month in November, TODAY asked doctors about the most common urological problems that they see in younger male adults, the warning signs of a serious condition and what to know to prevent them.\n1. AN INFLAMED PROSTATE\nProstate conditions are often associated with older adults, but younger men can also experience problems with their small, walnut-shaped organ located between the bladder and penis.\nProstatitis, or an inflamed prostate, is among the most common conditions seen among younger men in their 20s to 40s. \n“As with every organ in the body, the prostate can get infected,” Dr Jay Lim said.\nThe urologist in private practice with PanAsia Surgery Group added that in many cases, it is unclear why it happens but when the source is isolated, it is usually related to a bacterial infection of the urinary tract.\nUnlike a urinary tract infection (UTI), he said that the symptoms for an inflamed prostate can be hard to pinpoint and some patients may have difficulty describing their symptoms. \n“They sometimes feel that something is wrong, when they go to the toilet, when they sit or stand. Many of them describe this ‘heavy’ sensation but may not have overt symptoms like fever or blood in the urine when they have prostatitis,” Dr Lim said.\nA suspicious symptom would be bloody or painful ejaculation. Some people may report a pulling ache or a vague sensation in the perineal region (the area between the anus and the scrotum).\nSymptoms associated with UTI such as blood in the urine and painful urination can also occur with prostatitis.\nMost cases are not life-threatening and the immune system will fend it off, but Dr Lim advised men to seek medical attention and get prostatitis treated. \n“Treatment in the form of oral antibiotics for two weeks is usually recommended as it helps with the symptoms and prevent progression,” he said. \n“Without treatment, there will be symptoms and the recovery journey will take longer — months — to resolve.\"\nIn patients with existing conditions such as diabetes, prostatitis can worsen and evolve into a prostatic abscess (a build-up of pus within the prostate), he added.\n2. ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION AND LINKS TO STROKE OR HEART DISEASE\nFor men who have trouble obtaining or sustaining an erection sufficient for sexual intercourse, there is more to worry about other than their sexual performance. It could be a warning sign of a serious medical condition, such as heart disease or stroke.\nIt is estimated that erectile dysfunction may precede the first cardiovascular event by an average of three years. This is based on a review published in 2021 in the Journal of Clinical Medicine, an international and peer-reviewed journal on clinical and pre-clinical research.\nOne of the common conditions seen at the department of urology in Sengkang General Hospital is erectile dysfunction and it can happen to men of any age group. \nIn Singapore, a past study have shown that about half of the men over the age of 30 have some degree of erectile dysfunction. The condition becomes more prevalent and gets worse with age, particularly after 50. \nDr Thomas Chan, a consultant with Sengkang General Hospital’s department of urology, said, “Although it is more likely to occur with the advancement of age, it is a common misconception that erectile dysfunction is purely due to ageing.” \n“From our experience (managing this group of patients), erectile dysfunction can be attributed to overt or even undiagnosed metabolic diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.”\nThat said, not all erectile dysfunction is due to blocked arteries or other underlying medical conditions.\nFor some younger men, psychological factors such as stress, relationship problems and performance anxiety could affect their ability to achieve adequate erection.\n3. URINARY TROUBLES AND LINKS TO SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE\nThere are many reasons why men get UTIs: Diabetes, kidney stones and dehydration, for example. An enlarged prostate due to ageing could also lead to recurrent infections. \nDr Tan Wei Jie from Dtap Clinic said that in younger men, one of the common causes for UTI is a sexually transmitted infection (STI). \n“At Dtap, due to the nature of our practice, we see young men coming into our clinic with symptoms, and the majority of them will end up being diagnosed with a form of STI.”\nDtap clinics offer a general practitioner’s services with a focus on men and women’s health including sexual health. It also provides screening for STIs and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\nCommon STIs that can cause urological symptoms are chlamydia, gonorrhoea, trichomoniasis, mycoplasma and ureaplasma — Dr Tan sees around 10 to 20 of such cases each week. \nSome of these infections spread by sexual activity can also cause inflammation of the testicle and epididymis (the coiled tube behind each testis that stores and carries sperm).\nBesides painful urination and increased trips to the bathroom, other warning signs may include discharge from the penis, painful sex, blisters and sores around the genitals or anus. \nDr Tan said: “If any of those symptoms are present, you need to visit your healthcare providers as soon as possible for investigations and treatment.\n“STIs that are left untreated can develop complications such as infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease, kidney infection and even cancers affecting the penis, anus, back of the throat, cervix and vagina.”\nUntreated STIs can also be transmitted very easily through sexual intercourse. Individuals with symptoms should avoid sexual intercourse until they have been tested and cleared from the infection, Dr Tan added.\nHe also pointed out that some STIs can have no symptoms, so it is important to undergo regular screening to avoid passing any unwanted diseases to loved ones. \n 4. KIDNEY STONES FROM DEHYDRATION\nKidney stones is a painful urinary disorder that is more common among men and usually among those between 20 and 40 years old, the National Kidney Foundation states.\nLiving in a tropical climate, excessive caffeine intake from coffee, tea or cola, as well as not drinking enough water, are prime conditions for the body to develop kidney stones, Dr Lim from PanAsia Surgery said. \nHe also said that Singapore is situated along the “global stone belt” along with northern Australia, India, the Middle East and the southern part of the United States.\nPeople living in these places are more susceptible to developing kidney stones. These hard deposits made of minerals and salts that form inside the kidneys can affect any part of the urinary tract. \n“Caffeine beverages cause diuresis (increased urine flow or output) and contributes to dehydration of the body. A high-salt diet and high consumption of meat, along with a high oxalate intake, puts one at a greater risk of kidney stones as well as UTI,” Dr Lim explained. \nFoods rich in oxalate include peanuts, soy, almonds, potatoes, tea, cereal grains and beets.\nKidney stones can set off symptoms such as sudden back or flank pain, blood in urine and recurrent UTIs. When stones obstruct urine flow, severe pain or renal colic (sudden, acute pain in the kidney area) is often described as a 10-out-of-10 pain. \n“Without treatment, urine flow is obstructed and the obstructions can affect kidney function,” Dr Lim said. \nUrosepsis, a life-threatening condition, can occur when the obstructed urine becomes infected.\n“Even if the infection doesn’t happen, long-term obstruction of the kidney leads to destruction of the obstructed kidney. I’ve encountered patients in their 20s who lose one of their kidneys due to previously undiagnosed stone diseases,” Dr Lim added. \n1. STAY HYDRATED, PRACTISE SAFE SEX\nDr Lim said that many urological conditions that occur in younger men are preventable through simple changes to lifestyle and diet. Getting adequate hydration is one way, for example. \nHowever, how much fluid is considered “adequate” to prevent kidney stones?\nInternational guidelines recommend “producing 2.5L of urine per day”, Dr Lim said.\n“To achieve that, one would need around 3L of pH neutral fluids (water) because you lose around 500ml through sweat, skin and saliva,” he added.\n“But that may not be feasible. For my patients, I’ll tell them that minimally around 1.5L to 2L (around six to eight cups) of pH-neutral fluids a day is good enough.” \nDr Lim emphasised that the recommended fluid intake should not include caffeinated drinks such as coffee, tea and soft drinks. \n“Everyone thinks that you’re taking in fluids when you drink caffeinated beverages, but they do not count. They are a diuretic,” he said, meaning that they causes an increase in urine production.  \n“To simplify things, I tell my patients to imagine that if you drink a cup of coffee, you'll have to remember to top it up — with around 1.5 cups of water. While it's not exactly the amount, it helps my patients remember better.”\nDr Lim said that not holding in urine for long periods of time and voiding after sexual intercourse are other ways that may reduce the risk of urological problems. \n“Bodily fluids are exchanged during sexual intercourse. Voiding after intercourse (which refers to urinating after sex) helps with flushing the urethra and prevents UTIs,” he explained.\nThe doctors said that there are no specific check-ups or screening programmes for most urological conditions and for younger men. \n“Unless UTIs and stone diseases plague you or you have a family history of urological issues, most men below 50 will not need to see a urologist,” Dr Lim said.\n“However, it would be prudent to undergo an annual health screening that includes a urine test and imaging of the kidneys, which can detect early onset of urological problems.”\nProtecting against STI is also important. Dr Tan from Dtap advised men to practise safe sex by using a condom, staying in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship, reducing the number of sexual partners and abstaining from high-risk sexual intercourse. \nHe also advised staying up-to-date with the latest vaccinations for hepatitis B and the human papilloma virus that can be transmitted via sexual activity.\n 2. DO KEGEL EXERCISES\nWomen are often told to do Kegel exercises as a way to strengthen their pelvic floor muscles and improve bladder and bowel control, especially after pregnancy and childbirth. \nThey can benefit men in several ways, too, including alleviating certain urological symptoms.\nDr Chan from Sengkang General Hospital said that Kegel exercises are often recommended to men to prevent stress urinary incontinence — or urine leak — or who are recovering from it. Urine leak is a common side effect in the first few months after a prostatectomy (partial or complete removal of the prostate) for prostate cancer. \nThe exercises may help ease symptoms of an overactive bladder. They have also been advocated as a potential treatment method for erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation, Dr Chan added. \n“The strengthening of the pelvic floor muscles may improve penile rigidity in erectile dysfunction and may help delay premature ejaculation,” he said. \nTo reap the benefits, however, the right set of muscles must be engaged during the exercise. \n“The technique of Kegel exercises is often a difficult concept for men to understand and apply. But once it is understood, it can be done anytime, anywhere,” Dr Chan said. \nTo locate the pelvic floor muscles, try stopping urination mid-stream or tightening the muscles required to keep from passing out gas. \nOnce you have done so, perform two different series of Kegel exercises, with these tips from Dr Chan.\nConsult a urologist or specialist nurse if you want to do the Kegel exercises but still have difficulty locating the pelvic floor muscles."

Add grated parmesan cheese (about 1,500mg per 100g) and croutons (about 700mg per 100g), and a serving of salad will easily exceed the daily recommended sodium limit.\nEven the healthier versions of bread such as wholemeal bread, focaccia and French baguette are relatively high in sodium, with each 100g serving containing around 500mg.\nSteamed dim sum: Three pieces of steamed prawn dumplings contain 222mg of sodium, and two rolls of chee cheong fun (steamed rice rolls) with sweet sauce will add on another 400mg.\nOpt for plain rice instead of flavoured rice.\nAsk for no or less salt, sauces and gravy.\nConsume less gravy or soups. Refrain from finishing the soup when you have a soup dish because this is where a lot of sodium is.\nAdd aromatics, fresh herbs and spices if you need more flavour in your meal.\nIf you still prefer having sauces or dressing, ask that they be served separately. Only dip when necessary and do so sparingly.\nRefrain from dipping into extra condiments such as soy sauce and chilli sauce.\nConsider lower-sodium alternatives such as potassium salt (K-salt), which contains 30 per cent less sodium.\nHowever, people with medical conditions such as chronic or advanced stages of kidney disease should exercise caution with this salt substitute unless under guidance by a health professional. When kidney function is poor, the organs may not be able to excrete excess potassium from the body effectively, Ms Yeo said..\n.\n.\n.\n",
            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — In an effort to eat healthily, people may try to make better food choices when they dine out or at home, choosing to eat a bowl of noodle soup instead of fried food at the hawker centre, or have a salad or a “cleaner” lunch.\nYet, even when they choose one of these seemingly healthier food options, they might be exceeding the daily limit of sodium intake.\nHigh sodium intake is among the pressing public health concerns in Singapore, with nine in 10 people here consuming almost double the recommended daily limit by the World Health Organization, which is 2,000mg of sodium — equivalent to 5g or slightly less than a teaspoon of salt.\nSalt is made up of 40 per cent sodium and 60 per cent chloride.\nFindings from the National Nutrition Survey 2022 here showed that the daily sodium intake of Singapore residents rose from 3,480mg in 2019 to 3,620mg last year. \nAlong with this was a drastic increase in the proportion of people with hypertension, or high blood pressure.\nIn 2021 and 2022, more than a third of Singaporeans (37 per cent) were found to have hypertension. The figure was nearly double of the 19.8 per cent in 2010.\nThe chronic disease — which increases the risk of life-threatening illnesses such as kidney failure, stroke and heart attacks — does not affect only older adults.\nProfessor Tan Huay Cheem, senior consultant at the National University Heart Centre, Singapore, pointed out that around one in 12 (8.1 per cent) of young people between 18 and 29 years old have hypertension, based on the recent National Population Health Survey.\nProf Tan, who is chairman of the Singapore Heart Foundation, added: “For this young population, the risk of developing cardiovascular complications in future is significant.”\nHe recently spoke at the Symposium on Sodium Reduction in Singapore and the Role of Salt Substitutes, which took place at the Lifelong Learning Institute on Oct 21.\nOrganised by the Singapore Heart Foundation, the Singapore Nutrition and Dietetics Association, and National Kidney Foundation, the event featured talks and discussions on reducing sodium intake and the prevalence of heart and kidney-related illnesses in the population here.\nSenior dietitian Natalie Yeo from the Singapore Heart Foundation said that a major source of sodium comes from salt and sauces added during food preparation and cooking, as well as in meals sold at eating places.\n“Some foods such as bread, breakfast cereals and processed meats are fairly rich in sodium, too. And all of these can add up,” she said.\nSome foods are obviously high in salt (such as fries, bacon, tinned and preserved food), but you will also need to look out for the less obvious choices that may be loaded with sodium. For example:\nThe sodium content for each dish or food item may vary, depending on how it is prepared.\nSports drinks are promoted to help replenish electrolytes, fluids and glucose lost during a strenuous workout, improve endurance and energy levels.\nSteer clear of these drinks if you are watching your sodium intake and not exercising vigorously or for extended periods of time.\nSports drinks contain electrolytes such as sodium and potassium.\nDepending on the brand, the sodium content for every 100ml of the drink can range from 46mg to 92mg. For example, a 325ml can of 100 Plus contains around 150mg of sodium.\nSuch drinks are designed for use during exercise sessions that last more than 90 minutes, Ms Yeo said.\n“They are more suited to support athletes during their training by fuelling energy to the muscles and brain,” she added.\n“It is not a good idea to turn to electrolyte drinks as a go-to beverage because it is possible to over-indulge.\n“If the individual is not doing a vigorous workout, it could add to his or her overall calorie and sugar intake, too.”\nMs Yeo said that the increase in salt intake and hypertension numbers reflects evolving lifestyles and dietary habits among Singaporeans.\n“For example, individuals with busy and hectic lifestyles tend to eat out more than cook.\n“Without being mindful, sodium intake could quickly add up while dining out regularly,” she said.\n“Also, there is an increasing availability of processed foods on the go, as well as a wide variety of choices available through food delivery services.”\nOur tastebuds play a role, too. If you have always been eating food high in salt content, that can dull the sensitivity of your tastebuds.\n“This results in a need for a higher concentration of salt for one to detect saltiness,” Ms Yeo added.\nWhile sodium is an essential nutrient for the body, it needs only around 500mg — or less than a quarter teaspoon — each day to function normally, Prof Tan said.\nThe nutrient helps transmit nerve impulses, contract and relax muscle fibres including those in the heart and blood vessels, and maintain a proper fluid balance.\nHowever, too much sodium is harmful to body.\nAfter having a salty meal, a person may experience symptoms such as feeling bloated, feet swelling, thirst and frequent urination.\n“Natural excretion of excess salt will be carried out by the body.\n“(The symptoms) are usually self-limiting and resolve with time, with little consequences as the body able to regulate the sodium level through natural excretion,” Prof Tan explained.\n“However, too many holiday parties, rich salty hors d’oeuvres, delectable cakes and pudding can harm your cardiovascular health. This can increase risk of high blood pressure and stroke,” he added.\n“High level of sodium in the blood stream reduces the kidneys’ ability to remove water.\n“This can cause the body to retain water, resulting in an increase in overall blood volume, which then increases stress on the blood vessels, causing hypertension.”\nProf Tan said that it is important to reduce sodium intake from an early age. From age 18, people should also monitor their blood pressure even though hypertension is less common in younger people.\nMs Yeo said that slowly reducing sodium from your diet and adjusting to less salty flavours can help people get accustomed to a lower-sodium diet.\nThis can be done in 21 days or three weeks.\nShe suggested doing this gradually over three weeks, starting with being more mindful of food choices when dining out, buying takeaways or ordering in:\nMs Yeo said one thing to note is that Himalayan salt, sea salt, rock salt and kosher salt are not table-salt substitutes since they have similar sodium content by weight.\nIn a joint statement, the Singapore Nutrition and Dietetics Association, Singapore Heart Foundation and National Kidney Foundation emphasised the urgent need to reduce sodium intake in the population here to prevent diseases.\nOne of the key strategies it highlighted at the symposium last month was the use of lower-sodium salt substitutes, such as potassium-enriched salt and other salt blends with monosodium-glutamate or yeast extract.\nLower-sodium salt substitutes use a variety of minerals and ingredients to lower the sodium content of the product while preserving taste.\n“These substitutes can be used as one-for-one replacements for regular salt,” Prof Tan said.\nDerived from glutamate, flavour enhancer MSG is a naturally occurring amino acid that is found in nearly all foods.\nMSG can be used as a substitute for salt or used to replace some sodium chloride in table salt. It contains less than a third of sodium in table salt.\nThis is among the strategies to reduce sodium intake, by the Singapore Nutrition and Dietetics Association, Singapore Heart Foundation, and National Kidney Foundation.\n\n\n"

            "Article Body": "Increasingly, people are becoming aware of the importance of mental health and well-being in our lives. In our weekly Gen Zen series, TODAY looks at ways that we can feel better while coping with the mental stresses of modern life.\nSINGAPORE — Helpline volunteer Aisyah Abu Bakar recalled speaking to someone who had sought help on Youthline's chatline, but he was giving monosyllabic responses to her questions.\nSo she asked: \"What are some songs that best describe your current situation?\"\nThat broke the ice, as the caller became more responsive and gave a long list of songs he loved. \nNoticing the common themes of heartbreak and pain in the songs the caller shared, she then asked if the music reflected what he was feeling at the moment, which opened up the conversation into discussing why he was seeking help.\nThis is but one of the text conversations that Ms Aisyah has had with young people who seek help through Youthline’s WhatsApp chat line. The 24-year-old is visually impaired so she uses \"text-to-voice\" assistive technology, which converts text into spoken words.\nAnother volunteer at Youthline is Mr Kevin Wong, who is 32 years old this year and studying for a master’s degree in counselling and guidance at the National Institute of Education. He takes calls from the helpline and provides pro bono in-person counselling. \nBoth Ms Aisyah and Mr Wong have been surprised by the depths of struggle and isolation that some of their clients have faced. \nThis is even though the issues that young people tend to share over the conversations – often ranging from anxiety over studies or work to family issues – may be personally relatable to the volunteers. \n“Some of the clients who come to the helpline, they face really intense issues that need sorting out. But they lack the support around them,” Ms Aisyah said.\nAgreeing, Mr Wong said that he has spoken to clients who have endured complex experiences of clinical depression and grief, even at a young age.  \nYouthline is a registered charity founded last year that provides mental health services to young persons. It also runs the first youth-dedicated live helpline for anyone up to 35 years old.\nIt now supports up to 300 callers a week, with calls ranging from as short as 10 minutes to as long as five hours. \nAnother helpline that caters to a general public, Touchline by Touch Community Services, receives an average of about 100 calls a month. Around 30 out of a total of 320 calls for the last three months were from young persons. \nTODAY spoke to the people behind helplines that provide mental help support for the youth, to understand what is involved in such calls and what kind of support they provide for those in need.  \nEven though starting a conversation about one's mental health with a stranger may seem daunting, the helpline volunteers told TODAY that the caller sets the pace and tone of the conversation. Helpline officers are trained to convey empathy and not to judge the caller.\nFor first-time callers, Mr Wong assures them that whatever is shared will be kept confidential and there is no pressure for callers to reveal their name. \nOver the WhatsApp chatline, a helpline care officer will attend to a chat within 30 seconds, unless there is a high volume.\nMs Aisyah said that she lets conversations take its natural course and tries to look at issues through the other person's point of view in a non-judgemental manner. \nFor those who may have a harder time opening up, she typically starts discussing a more general topic, such as asking if they have had lunch or what interests they might have. \n“This helps in bridging the human connection and trust between the texter and helpline care officer before delving into their issues,” she added. \nHelpline care officers then gauge what support the individual needs, because some might simply need an outlet to vent their feelings, while others need a partner to brainstorm ways to approach a certain situation.\nThe non-judgemental and confidential space offered by a helpline can support youth who may need a listening ear on issues affecting their mental health.\nMs Andrea Chan, head of Touch Mental Wellness at Touch Community Services, said: “We also receive calls from young adults who are finding out if what they are facing is normal. Generally, there is a lack of knowledge and a sense of helplessness when they call for help.” \nAgreeing, Ms Aisyah said: “Sometimes, people have this mindset that seeking help is a weakness, but it is a form of empowerment.\n“I always have this idea that it is okay to not be okay. But it's not okay to remain not okay.”\nYouthline said that one third of the texts and calls from youth tend to be regarding mental health conditions such as anxiety, depression, delusions or hallucinations.\nAnother third have psycho-social problems such as stress, concerns regarding self-esteem and self-worth, or a sleep disorder. \nA third of their clients reach out regarding high-risk conditions such as suicidal thoughts, self-harm, sexual assault, bullying as well as relationship and family issues. \nAt Touchline, the youth tend to call to discuss challenges in school or relationship problems with a partner or family member. \n“Over the years, the demands on youth have increased. Besides the usual familial, social and academic stress, they also need to juggle a digital identity and the complexity of being in a highly globalised world,” Ms Chan said. \nTaking the first step to reach out for help takes courage, but Ms Aisyah said that young people who do seek help can find access to “abundant resources” such as helplines and free counselling services. \nA helpline can serve as a first point of contact, as a space for them to feel welcomed and assured that their concerns will be taken seriously and their feelings validated, while also being a way to link them up to relevant resources. \nMs Aisyah said: “If you really don't know what (resources) are meant for you, it's okay, you can just reach out and express what you need or what your issue is and you will get referred to somewhere that is much more helpful to your situation.”\nMr Wong said that helpline care officers are trained to support the caller to share more about the problem they are facing and to explore the resources and coping strategies or solutions they may have already tried. \nThey also help the individuals to explore other options or resources they can consider to address their problems. \nReaching out to one’s social system for support is key, Mr Wong said. \n“Sometimes you're so caught up in your work, studies and life and you think, ‘Okay, never mind, I'm going to say no to meeting my friends, I'm going to say no to spending time with my mum and taking a walk in the Botanic Gardens… But sometimes, you have to say yes to these things, because these things are important and you get to spend time with family and friends, and be in nature.” \nMs Chan from Touch Community Services said that being willing to reach out for help and talk to a family member or friend who can provide support, or seeking professional help if the thoughts or challenges one is facing become unmanageable,is a key way to protect mental well-being. \n“The path to mental wellness is not necessarily linear. Periods of high stressors may come our way, but one thing we can do is to band together and provide that support to each other,” she added.\nPeople should also diversify their support system, Ms Aisyah said. \n“The support system you are dependent on may get exhausted and burnt out, and sometimes may not be able to attend to you fully. So getting a wide range of support systems is important. Plus, it helps to have different perspectives,” she added.\nIf you, or anyone you know might want to talk to someone, you can reach out to one of the helplines below. \nYouthline: +65 6436 6612 (call), +65 8533 9460 (text) and over email at hello@youthline.sg. \nYouthline is dedicated to individuals up to 35 years old and provides free mental health support to youth via phone, email or a live chat service. It runs from 9am to midnight daily. Calls outside of operating hours are redirected to Samaritans of Singapore or the Singapore Civil Defence Force for emergency medical services.\n\n\n\n"

            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — As someone who has had depression since the age of 15, Raven (who did not want to be identified by her real name) would not have minded staying in a dedicated facility for youth prone to suicide risk or self-harm. This would have provided a respite from home, where she often felt very isolated, exacerbating her depression.\nShe added that with round-the-clock care and a good in-patient programme provided at such a place, it would have definitely speeded up her recovery as well.\nNow 27, she was commenting after it was announced on Thursday (Oct 5) that such a facility catered to the youth is being planned as part of the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy to improve mental healthcare for various segments of the population here.\nMany details are still in the works, but the goal is for this intermediary care centre to serve as a rehabilitation centre where young people may seek refuge, free of stigma, in a safe environment for up to six months.\nThis is a live-in facility where a team of psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, live-in staff members and nurses attend to youth with suicide risk who have received primary care, in order to address underlying triggers before they get home.\nRaven said that having a home away from home would be really helpful, especially if young people do not have access to other mental healthcare.\nHowever, she and some other young people, as well as mental health practitioners, told TODAY that they do have certain concerns about how such a place would be run and how it will ensure that the patients return to leading a normal life.\nMr Ian, 27, who did not want to give his full name and is diagnosed with panic disorder, said that a care facility that promises a safe and stigma-free zone is beneficial for youth to develop some clarity on why they are feeling troubled.\nPanic disorder is an anxiety disorder where people regularly have sudden attacks of panic or fear. Even though people can experience general anxiety or panic during stressful moments, people with panic disorder have frequent and unexpected panic attacks and spend long periods in constant fear of another attack.\n“I didn't fully understand what triggered my anxiety as soon as I was diagnosed, so to be in a facility with a team of professionals at the ready to immediately help you with what is troubling you, that would have been very beneficial and insightful,” the freelance creative director added.\nHe observed that at a young age, people often lack the vocabulary to articulate what they are going through, so to get a grasp on it and develop some understanding of their condition would be useful.\n“I know at 20, I didn't have the verbiage or the understanding of the world to comprehend what was causing me to be suicidal.”\nAs for 22-year-old Ashely Poo, a polytechnic student who is diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety, she said: “I think it’s a great initiative for youths to have a safe space, especially when home isn’t one.”\nLike Raven, she also said that being at home can be “triggering” because it intensifies feelings of isolation and can exacerbate mental illness. \nRaven said: “If it is presented as an easily accessible option for teenagers, I do think it's a great thing, because seeking avenues for help was something I struggled with as a teenager.”\nDr Jonathan Kuek, a mental health advocate, is co-founder of The Total Wellness Initiative Singapore, which seeks to encourage people to be more proactive with their well-being.\nHe said that having a facility like this is “a fantastic idea”. \nHe believes that the concept would be similar to crisis houses overseas, where care is provided in a residential setting instead of an overtly medical one such as a hospital.  \nThey offer intensive, short-term support to help people manage mental health crises.\n“A shift to rehabilitation means there can be a greater focus on more well-rounded care that targets the psychosocial and emotional challenges that youths may be facing, instead of a greater focus on managing the risk of harm and symptoms,” Dr Kuek added. \nThis move away from a hospital setting is vital for young people who might feel intimidated and hesitant to be admitted to one, a counsellor said.\nMr Thum Berfont, a senior rehabilitation counsellor from Anglican Care Centre (Pasir Ris), a non-profit organisation that offers counselling sessions, said: “The mixed profile of patients held in the general ward (in terms of age and diagnosis) could make the environment more challenging for youths who are grappling with acute stressors.”\nHe also said that being in the mixed environment of a psychiatric hospital with a range of patients consisting of adults undergoing mental health relapses can be intimidating and stressful for younger patients. \n“It's important to recognise that the approach required for managing acute stress reactions differs from the one used for chronic mental health conditions or relapses.”\nThese sentiments were shared by freelance creative director Ian, who was admitted to the Institute of Mental Health when he was 20, and he described the experience as “overwhelming”.\nAs a young person having a mental health crisis, facing a new strict daily routine with designated mealtimes as part of his in-patient programme, no access to the outdoors, unfamiliar faces around him, and coping with a new environment can be disorientating. \n“I wanted someone to sit me down and take as much time as I needed to really comprehend what I was going through,” he recalled. “I hope that this facility gives space to the young, that they are given the attention they need for the length of time that they require.”\nHaving espoused the good of having an alternative healing space, the interviewees and the experts said that a facility of this sort will still not do much to eradicate the stigma associated with mental health.\nIt might even draw undue attention to suicide and its associated pains and repercussions, making youth-at-risk even more uncomfortable to step forward and seek help.\n“I think it's a double-edged sword, honestly,” Raven said, “as suicide risk is still a pretty serious issue, so I think having a programme dedicated to just that could be quite alienating since it singles out (those with suicide risk).” \nTo add to that, Ms Poo said that there is a fear of people finding out that you were admitted to such a facility. She also wondered if a stay in such a place would be reflected on official records and affect employment, for example.\nMs Ling Anne Hsieh, one of the founders of Project Green Ribbon, said that the facility is a “good option” to have but could be seen as a mere band-aid to the root cause of a troubled mind.\nProject Green Ribbon is a non-profit organisation that takes in youth in crisis and provides refuge and support for them as they go through a transition and reintegrate into society. \nMs Ling also said: “Most of the time, when (young people) are having such troubles, a lot of it stems from childhood. Much of it stems from broken families, or even intact families but just dysfunctional.” \nThe focus should be on preventive and early care, she suggested. \nMs Ling believes that it would be hard to run away from the stigma that comes along with having to seek treatment for suicidal leanings, so the facility's name and positioning must be a “careful” process because “every label that we put will give a certain image”. \nAgreeing with Ms Ling, Dr Kuek said: “The devil’s in the details when it comes to execution.”\nHe added: “There is a real possibility that despite the best efforts of the facility, the root causes of (what the person is dealing with) may not be solved through their stay, and a strong continuity and community of care is necessary as well.\n“If this is not done well and intentionally, it may lose its potential effectiveness.” \nMost of the interviewees brought up the matter of the healthcare costs of staying at such a care centre.\n“Even for working adults, affording mental healthcare can be too costly, so I do hope it's a programme that's heavily subsidised or even free for teenagers,” Raven said.\nFurthermore, it is unclear now how the stay would work around school and studies such that the residents do not fall too far behind the curriculum. \nAnd looking at the capacity of the facility, Dr Kuek foresees that there will almost certainly be more people needing admission than there are spaces available, especially given that it will be the first of its kind. \n“Identifying and selecting who gets to be placed in it will be tricky, and what happens after they leave will be an issue,” he said.\nThis is because, despite best efforts, the source of mental distress may not be solved through their stay. \nEqual emphasis needs to be placed on the continuity of care after their stint at the facility, be it follow-ups from counsellors or community services. Dr Kuek warned, though, that this might then weigh heavy on manpower resources.\n“With all these questions and concerns taken together, it is uncertain how many youths will be able to benefit from such an approach given its proposed initial scale,” he added."

            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — A new specialised care facility will be piloted to support youth who are at risk of suicide, the Government said.\nThis was announced on Thursday (Oct 5) during the launch of the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy, which aims to build up the country’s mental health ecosystem to offer accessible clinical care to people who need it.\nFor young persons with suicide risk, not all have mental health conditions, the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) said in releasing a 49-page report of the national strategy.\nOn average each year, 650 people aged 10 to 19 with suicide risk are admitted to the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) and at least half of these do not suffer from any mental health conditions.\nInstead, triggers are usually related to stressors such as difficult interpersonal relationships with family, peers or romantic partners.\nAfter they are discharged from IMH, some of these young people might be re-admitted because they find it hard to cope with their living environment. \n“An intermediate residential facility will be piloted for this group of youths to stabilise them in a safe and nurturing environment, while providing psycho-social interventions to address underlying triggers before discharge,” the ministries said in a news release.\nMOH and MSF are co-leading the Inter-agency Taskforce on Mental Health and Well-being, formed in July 2021 to oversee and coordinate mental health efforts across various public sector agencies. \nThe task force, which developed the national strategy, is chaired by Dr Janil Puthucheary, Senior Minister of State for Health and for Communications and Information.\nHe said on Thursday at a press conference: “What we want to do is to improve the mental health support ecosystem here... where people live in a caring and inclusive society, seek help without stigma and are ready to support one another.”\nThe plan is to also avoid unwarranted medicalising when it comes to treatments and to reduce the stigma around mental health, the task force said in the report.\nThe intermediate facility for young people who are at risk of suicide is envisioned to be a rehabilitation centre where they may seek refuge free of stigma in a safe environment for short periods of time, or up to six months.\nThis is a live-in facility where a team of psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, live-in staff members and nurses attend to them to address underlying triggers before they are discharged.\nDetails on payment methods and insurance coverage, the facility's capacity as well as its location are still in the works. \nTo better support parents in helping to manage their children’s mental health, a “toolbox” is being developed to empower and equip them with personalised knowledge and skills to build strong parent-child relationships and to strengthen their children’s mental well-being and resilience.\nThis resource kit is expected to be launched early next year, and it is suitable for households that might not fit into the typical nuclear family structure.\nMSF said at a media briefing: “Strategies in the toolbox are practical in nature and (therefore), any profile of family should be able to use it.”\nIt added that the toolkit is “not your typical, very dense, structured parenting programme”. \n“These are evidence-based strategies taken from research such that diverse kinds of profiles would find the strategies easy to use on a day-to-day basis.” \nThe toolkit also serves to combat any stigma parents might have against mental health conditions, with information on mental health literacy, children’s mental well-being and tips on how to detect early signs of distress in children. \nA recent national health survey found that the highest proportion of people with poor mental health were from the 18 to 29 age group.\nThat is why the task force is looking to scale up ongoing efforts to build mental and socio-emotional resilience in the young by introducing emotional development lessons in preschools.\nThis is led by the Early Childhood Development Agency, which will make available resources and training for early childhood educators.\nAs for improving mental health literacy and reducing stigma, some of the initiatives detailed in the national strategy report include:\nThese efforts will be expanded and targeted at children aged seven years and above. \nEven though social media has always been a double-edged sword when it comes to emotional and mental health, the task force recognises that outright banning of social media usage is not ideal either.\nThe Ministry of Education (MOE) said: “We are unlikely to go the way of China when it comes to young people owning personal devices.”\nIt was referring to the Cyberspace Administration of China proposing rules that will see people under 18 banned from accessing the internet on mobile devices from 10pm to 6am. Different age groups will be allowed certain durations a day to use their phones, for example.\nAs part of MOE's 2030 masterplan to develop digitally literate learners, secondary school students have their own personal learning devices such as iPads. \nMOE has so far strengthened cyber wellness education in schools and institutes of higher learning by training and nurturing students to be discerning, safe, respectful and responsible users in cyberspace.\nThe young are also taught the importance of respect and empathy, how to protect themselves and others online, and how to seek help when necessary.\nHPB also provides cyber-wellness tips on MindSG, a one-stop online portal with mental health resources, targeted at teenagers and youth. \nMOE recognised that although there are many negative aspects to social media usage for young people, many of them also use it as a tool for learning.\nParents play a critical role in guiding their children as they navigate the digital world and so, they will find that the upcoming toolkit mentioned earlier will help them understand the digital landscape and empower them to support their children.\nA “positive use” guide on technology and social media will also be introduced to show how technology and social media can contribute to or hinder youth developmental processes.\n“It's a very fine balance, but we can't tell them not to use it. We prefer to teach them how to use it,” MOE said. \nThe full report of the national strategy is available on MOH’s website."

            "Article Body": "NEW YORK — My older child has always been an early riser. He rarely snoozes past 6am and wakes up with enthusiasm. As a night owl, I often marvel at how I created this morning lark.\n“Everybody’s ‘clock’ is set a little differently,” said Dr Leisha Cuddihy, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Rochester’s Comprehensive Sleep Center.\nHere are some expert tips that can help mornings feel more tolerable, and even productive.\nLOCK IN YOUR WAKE TIME. To shift your sleep schedule, the trick is to set a consistent wake time, and stick to it every day, said Dr Rafael Pelayo, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences in sleep medicine at Stanford Medicine.\nIt takes about a week for your body to adjust for every hour you move up your wake time, he added.\nACKNOWLEDGE YOUR NATURE. Even if you are an early riser, you may not wake up ready to start the day. “A lot of people, no matter what time they wake up, just need a minute,” Dr Cuddihy said.\nAcknowledging that can help bring peace to the morning, she said. Find ways to protect quiet time: Sit in bed and take a few deep breaths.\nCouple it with a strategy known to increase wakefulness, like soaking up some sunlight.\nREWARD YOURSELF — IMMEDIATELY. People tend to change habits when doing so feels relatively easy and rewarding, said Dr Wendy Wood, a professor of psychology and business at the University of Southern California.\nSo if your goal is to wake up earlier — or to mitigate early morning grouchiness — it is essential to build in immediate rewards.\nConsider what would feel good after you wake up. Maybe it’s a delicious breakfast or playing music you love.\nTURN ROUTINES INTO MEANINGFUL RITUALS. “When you shift something from a routine into a ritual, it makes it more special,” said Dr Cassie Mogilner Holmes, author of “Happier Hour: How to Beat Distraction, Expand Your Time and Focus on What Matters Most.”\nFocus on something you already do every day, like having a morning cup of coffee. Label it your “coffee ritual,” Dr Holmes said.\nNotice, with wonder, what it feels like to go through each step. Use a special mug or enjoy a particularly delicious brew.\n“All of a sudden, it puts you in a different frame of mind,” Dr Holmes said.\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

            "Article Body": "PARIS — Despite claims that the fashion industry is embracing curvier bodies, the data suggests it could be guilty of what one expert calls \"fat-washing\".\nWhile a handful of plus-size models such as Paloma Elsesser have grabbed media attention in recent years, the figures show they remain a vanishingly small minority. \nVogue Business looked at 9,137 outfits unveiled during 219 shows in New York, London, Milan and Paris last season and found that 0.6 per cent were plus-size — defined as US size 14 or above, which is actually the average size for a woman in the United States — and only 3.8 per cent were size 6 to 12.\nThis means 95.6 per cent of outfits presented were in US sizes 0 to 4.\nDr Paolo Volonte, who teaches sociology of fashion in Milan, says brands use a few curvy models to deflect criticism. \n\"It's 'fat-washing',\" he told AFP, comparing it to criticisms of cynical \"green-washing\" by which the industry is accused of making empty climate pledges. \n\"They use curvy models in their shows to show inclusivity but in fact, this is to preserve and maintain a system based on the tyranny of the thin ideal,\" Dr Volonte said.\nMs Ekaterina Ozhiganova, a 31-year-old model and law student, says luxury brands simply \"refuse to represent normal people\". \nMedium-sized women \"are often told either to lose weight... or to push themselves up to XL,\" she told AFP. \"Neither is healthy.\" \nMs Ozhiganova's advocacy group, Model Law, carried out a survey that found nine out of 10 models felt pressure to change their bodies, more than half on a regular basis. \n\"It's very hard for them to talk about,\" she said. \"If you complain, everyone will just say: 'Darling, that's the job.'\"\nHow it became \"the job\" is a question of history. \nDr Volonte says the obsession with thinness dates back to the birth of industrial production techniques. \nPreviously, designers made clothes specific to individuals. In the mass production era, they use small templates which they scale up for larger sizes. \nThis only works up to a certain size, however, after which fat and muscle can change the shape of bodies in more complex ways. \n\"It is much more expensive to produce and sell clothing in higher sizes and requires more expertise,\" said Dr Volonte. \nAt the same time, thinness became firmly associated with wealth — having the time and money to work on your body — an aspiration that has been deeply entrenched by advertising and the day-to-day practices of the fashion industry.\nThere have been efforts to change things since the early 2000s when fears spread that size-zero models were encouraging anorexia in young people. \nSince 2017, France has required models to pass medical examinations, while the country's two biggest luxury conglomerates, LVMH and Kering, signed charters vowing to stop using size-zero models.\nBut with sizes varying from one brand to the next, this is hard to enforce.  \nDesigners are as trapped in the status quo as everyone else. \nElite couturier Mohammad Ashi says discrimination based on race and gender has been fairly well tackled in fashion, but shape is tricky. \n\"We're not trying to avoid it, but from an industrial point of view, we can't produce a plus-size dress. We sell what we show and I know our clients personally. It's just business,\" he told AFP. \nCouturier Julien Fournie has used pregnant models and his favourite model, Michaela Tomanova, has \"six centimetres everywhere more than the others\". \nBut he says, \"fashion remains fashion... It's a fantasy world and that will never change fundamentally.\" AFP"

            "Article Body": "The first time I walked in on my nephew chasing the family’s pet cat around the house, my first reaction was to tell him not to do that.\nGiven a talking-to for “disturbing” the cat, he stopped but went back to doing the same after a while. Around five or six years old at the time, he had seemed oblivious to the cat’s distress.\nThe cat, being swift and nimble, was not harmed, although my nephew got scratched once.\nWas he being mischievous and curious about how the cat would react to his chasing? Or was his behaviour suggestive of something more concerning? Was I right in trying to discipline him?\nI did not think that my nephew had malicious intent, but I could not help my own nagging feeling: When children behave in an unruly manner towards animals, when should the adults in their lives worry?\nIn the last few years, there have been cases of animal cruelty by children and youth that made the news.\nAmong these was a 10-year-old boy who threw a community cat off a public housing block. The cat died.\nIn a separate case, a 19-year-old, who pleaded guilty and was given a community sentence for several offences such as trespassing a rhino enclosure at the Singapore Zoo and killing a live frog on a foosball table.\nIn April this year, a teenaged boy was arrested for committing an obscene act on a cat.\nFigures by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) showed that the number of animal welfare and cruelty cases was at its highest last year since 2020.\nIn total, there were 481 cases in 2020, 324 in 2021 and 511 last year.\nIn the same period, there was a seven-fold increase in the number of cases involving child and youth animal abusers.\nOf the total cases reported, there was one case each in 2020 and 2021 that involved youth (under the age of 21), but there were seven such cases last year.\nSPCA said that the numbers reflect cases that had enough evidence of animal abuse and exclude suspected cases with inconclusive evidence.\nThe absolute number of cases involving a child or teenager may seem low, but Ms Aarthi Sankar, executive director of SPCA, said that “a single case is arguably one too many, especially among this young age group”.\nShe observed that the common ways in which animal abuse was carried out included:\nActs of animal cruelty and abuse are never acceptable no matter the perpetrator’s age. However, I cannot help but wonder if such cases could have been prevented if the adults in these young people’s lives had stepped in earlier to intervene.\nAt the same time, I was also appalled by the intense public vitriol and threats against some of the young culprits. For example, online users called for the 10-year-old to be taught a similar painful lesson and to be jailed, with some threatening to throw him off the building.\nHow helpful would retributive justice be in addressing the complex psycho-social aspects involved in children who commit such acts?\nMental health experts I spoke to said that any incident of animal maltreatment by children must always be addressed and not waved off as child’s play or curiosity.\nHowever, they also pointed out that reacting to the child’s wrongdoing in anger, or physically punishing or intimidating the child would be counterproductive and may even perpetuate the circle of violence.\nDr Lim Boon Leng, a psychiatrist from Dr BL Lim Centre for Psychological Wellness, said: “Parents should always be concerned when they observe their children mistreating animals. It might be indicative of underlying emotional distress and maybe a reflection of the child’s difficult or abusive environment.\nHe added: “Addressing the incident allow for an opportunity to educate the child (to understand) right from wrong in the very least.\n“Leaving the incidents alone is detrimental to the child and may result in the behaviours escalating.”\nTo find effective ways to correct the behaviour, it is helpful to first understand the child’s or youth’s motivations or triggers.\nIn children, the motivation to hurt an animal typically differs from that of adult animal abusers, Dr Lim said.\nIn adults, the most common reason for animal cruelty is anger, and this is often rooted in power dynamics, a history of violence or even psychopathy.\nChildren, however, may not know right from wrong, and may externalise their negative emotions and act out on their pets or animals they see, he said. \nBesides curiosity or exploration, a child’s motivations for animal cruelty may include peer pressure, to relieve boredom or when coerced to do so by a more powerful individual (for example, an adult in the child’s life).\nSome children may have animal phobia, and pre-emptively attack the animal they fear, Dr Lim suggested.\nDr Cherie Chan, a clinical psychologist with The Other Clinic, a private practice, said that it is important to distinguish between the types of cruelty to determine how best to intervene.\nFor example, is there deliberate intention to hurt the animal or is it a case of neglect such as forgetting to feed the pet?\n“Educating the child on the importance of relating and respecting living relationships could help reduce neglectful behaviours,\" she said.\n“For deliberate acts of cruelty, it may be helpful to talk about why it occurred and to understand if there are associations in the home or school environment that may have encouraged the display of aggression.”\nWhen asked how to tell the difference between a child’s curiosity and intentional abuse, Ms Sankar from SPCA said that there are several considerations: The type of action, how long it has been going on, intention and the child’s response to signs of distress from the animals.\n“For the type of action, there is a clear difference between a child who pokes a cat’s belly with a finger to elicit a reaction, and a child who tries to drive a pair of scissors into the cat’s belly.”\nCertain tools, such as a pair of scissors, are almost always used to cause destruction, she said.\n“Children who have been exposed to these implements, such as in school, can reasonably be expected to know the dangers of using them and hence understand the injury they can inflict. This knowledge increases their culpability beyond mere curiosity,” she added. \nA child who repeats the action, especially if the animal shows distress, is also more likely to be intentionally cruel than curious.\n“However, this is based on the assumption that the child can accurately read the body language of the animal.\n“The ability to read such cues tends to be lower among young children and children with certain disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder,” Ms Sankar added.\nThese would be those that cover topics such as animal welfare and responsible pet ownership.\nThe Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) offers youth engagement programmes such as the Youth Ambassador Programme for children aged seven to 16. There is also an upcoming youth animal welfare symposium in October to allow those above the age of 16 to engage in meaningful discussions surrounding animal welfare advocacy issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Lim said that studies show a higher prevalence of animal cruelty in children with developmental delays, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and conduct disorder.\nHe once encountered a primary school boy with ADHD whose impulsive behaviour and hyperactivity affected the way he treated his pet dog. His parents were often frustrated with his behaviour and would physically punish him.\n“When the boy became frustrated, especially after a run-in with his parents, he would often lash out at the dog, pulling its tail, hitting or screaming at it,” Dr Lim said.\nThe boy and his parents were referred to a child psychologist to work through the behavioural issues. Medications were given to help manage the boy’s impulsivity and hyperactivity.\nThe parents were also taught to manage their child’s behaviour with positive parenting techniques.\nOver time, the child developed a healthier relationship with his pet and the abusive behaviour stopped, Dr Lim said.\n“This case illustrates the complex interplay between a mental health issue, parenting difficulties and animal abuse.\n“The boy’s behaviour was unacceptable but it was rooted in his struggle with ADHD and his parents inability to cope with his ADHD behaviour.”\nWith the right support and intervention, such situations can improve, he added.\n“This emphasises the importance of understanding and address the underlying issues.”\nIn some cases, animal abuse by a child could also be a sign for child abuse or exposure to domestic violence.\nWhile younger children may act out of curiosity, Dr Lim said that animal abuse carried out by older children who are above 10 years old is associated with child abuse, with these children being two or three times more likely to have been directly abused themselves.\n“They have also often witnessed family violence, including that of violence towards their pets by family members.\n“One study has shown that about a third (32 per cent) of children exposed to domestic violence go on to engage in animal abuse,” he said.\n“It is likely that these children are desensitised to violence or are modelling the adults in their lives.\n“Moreover, children who feel disempowered in their personal lives might harm animals to exert control or gain a sense of power,” Dr Lim added.\nDr Chan the clinical psychologist agreed. When asked what could possibly be the motivation behind a young person’s disturbing behaviour, she said that acts of animal cruelty could possibly stem from curiosity as well as experiences of violence or abuse in the child’s personal life.\n“There is a possibility that individuals who engage in behaviour (that includes performing obscene acts) may be objectifying animals and fail to feel empathy or emotions towards a ‘less powerful’ (living thing),” Dr Chan added. \nIn changing the behaviour of a young animal abuser, the mental health experts said that the focus should not be to lay blame on the child alone, and that a more compassionate approach may be more appropriate.\n“The focus should be on rehabilitation and understanding, not retribution.\n“Rehabilitative programmes, if well-structured and comprehensive, can be effective in altering the child’s behaviour,” Dr Lim said.\nOn the other hand, public condemnation is likely to be more harmful and unhelpful: Threatening or harming the child can reinforce their negative views on adults and society in general, further traumatising the child and worsening their behaviour, he added.\nPhysically punishing the child may halt the behaviour temporarily, but it does not address the root causes, be it impulse control difficulties or family violence.\nFostering empathy, encouraging open communication and understanding the child’s feelings and motivations, as well as their environment, would be more effective in bringing about long-lasting change, Dr Lim advised.\nIn the case of the 10-year-old boy who threw the cat off a housing block for instance, he was placed on a “diversionary programme” conducted by the Animal and Veterinary Service (AVS), after being assessed by a psychiatrist not to have attained sufficient maturity to understand the nature and consequences of his conduct and taking his age into account.\nMs Jessica Kwok, group director of AVS, said that the diversionary programme was assessed to be the most appropriate course of action in this case because the programme centres on rehabilitation, by getting the offender to understand animal welfare, how to care for animals, living with animals in the community, and why his actions were wrong.\nAfter completing the one-month programme, the boy expressed regret and remorse over his actions, and apologised to the cat’s caregivers.\nHe was issued a stern warning from AVS, which will continue to work with his school to monitor his progress.\nMs Kwok said that this programme has been conducted before for offenders, with the curriculum of each programme tailored to the profile of the offender.\nMs Sankar said that continued support and guidance are pivotal in preventing youth from repeating such actions.\nIn the case of the 10-year-old boy above, for example, SPCA recommends regular follow-ups involving both the parent and the child on a quarterly basis to ensure that a robust support system is in place for the youth's rehabilitation.\nCollaborative efforts among the school, family and the authorities are essential in ensuring a comprehensive approach.\n“In addition, we encourage vigilant neighbours to report any suspected animal abuse to the authorities or SPCA.\n“By working together as a community, we can take necessary steps to prevent such tragedies from recurring,” Ms Sankar said.\nDr Lim stressed that it is crucial for parents and family to be involved in correcting abusive behaviour.\nParenting training — that is focused on positive parenting and limit setting aimed at helping children develop empathy — has been shown to be effective at improving anti-social behaviours such as animal abuse, he said.\nIn children, limit setting refers to the process where caregivers establish and communicate boundaries, rules and expectations to guide the child’s behaviour. It helps children understand what behaviours are acceptable and what are not, Dr Lim explained.\nMy nephew, now 10, is older and better able to rein in his impulsive behaviour. When we asked why he was chasing the cat around, he said that he had just wanted to play with it.\nStill, we felt it was important to educate him on how to interact with animals. We explained how his actions were stressing the cat.\nHe has since learnt more appropriate ways to interact with it, for example, by gently stroking it on the head instead of touching areas such as the tail.\nRecently, he worriedly informed me that the cat appeared to be having flu symptoms, and asked that I take it to a clinic for a check-up. Looking at his concerned face, I was relieved that he was showing concern for his pet. "

            "Article Summary": "The Ministry of Health released the results of the 2022 National Population Health Survey.\nIt found that the highest proportion of people with poor mental health were from the 18 to 29 age group at 25.3 per cent .\nMore Singapore residents were willing to seek informal help when they were unable to cope with stress.\nThey would approach friends, relatives or religious leader, for example.\nAs for the Health Promotion Board's 2022 National Nutrition Survey, it showed worrying trends such as a higher sodium intake and an increased calorie consumption among Singapore residents",
            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — Slightly over a quarter of Singapore residents aged 18 to 29 suffered from poor mental health last year, a national survey has found.\nThis group of youth made up the highest proportion of residents who faced mental health issues compared to other age groups, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on releasing its findings from the 2022 National Population Health Survey on Wednesday (Sept 27). \nThe proportion of young people dealing with mental health issues in 2022 — 25.3 per cent — was an increase from the 21.5 per cent in 2020. \nIn comparison, the prevalence of poor mental health in those aged 30 to 39 was 19.4 per cent last year, a rise from 12.6 per cent in 2020.\nFor those aged 40 to 49, the proportion was 15.7 per cent, up from 12.4 per cent in 2020. \nOverall, 17 per cent of Singapore residents faced mental health issues last year, up from 13.4 per cent in 2020.\nHowever, more people were also willing to seek informal help — such as from friends, relatives or religious leaders — when they were unable to cope with stress, the study found.\nMOH's survey tracked the health and risk factors, as well as lifestyle practices of Singapore residents aged 18 to 74 between July 2021 to June 2022. \nAs part of the study, about 8,000 residents completed household interviews and around 9,000 attended a health examination. \nThe increase in \"help-seeking behaviour\" displayed by Singapore residents in response to stress \"reflects continued public awareness of mental health, and reduced stigma around mental health conditions\", MOH said on Wednesday.\nThe study found that more people on the whole were willing to seek help informally from their social circle (79.7 per cent) than from healthcare professionals (56.6 per cent) if they were constantly unable to cope with stress. \nInformal support networks include friends, relatives and teachers, while healthcare professionals include counsellors and psychologists. \nHowever, the proportion of residents who were willing to seek informal help decreased with age, the study found.\nThe 18-to-29 age group was the most willing (88.1 per cent) to seek help informally. Older adults aged 60 to 74 were the least willing, with 68.4 per cent saying they would seek help. \nAs for seeking help from healthcare professionals, 60.1 per cent of those aged 18 to 29 said that they would do so.\nThis was even lower (48.1 per cent) among older adults aged 60 to 74.\nThose aged 30 to 39 years (62.0 per cent) were the most willing to do so.\nFemales were also more willing to seek help from healthcare professionals and informal support networks compared to males, the study found.\nIn a separate survey by the Health Promotion Board (HPB), the findings revealed some unhealthy dietary trends among residents last year.\nThese included rises in sodium intake and calorie consumption among Singapore residents.\nHPB's 2022 National Nutrition Survey monitored the dietary patterns and nutritional status of 3,000 Singapore residents aged 18 to 69 from December 2021 to August 2022.\nAlthough this National Nutrition Survey found that sugar consumption had declined since 2018, sodium intake remained high. \nThe daily sodium intake of the population increased from 3,480mg in 2019 to 3,620mg in 2022.\nNine in 10 Singapore residents exceeded the daily recommended sodium intake of less than 2,000mg, which is equivalent to one teaspoon of salt. This was a slight rise from 88 per cent in the last study done in 2019. \nA key source of sodium consumption is the salt and sauces added during cooking, as well as in meals eaten outside of home, HPB said. \nSoupy dishes were the main source of sodium, followed by convenience foods and gravy or sauce-based dishes. \nHPB added that on average, sodium content for every dish sold outside has increased by 22 per cent from 2010 to 2023.\nThis was due to increases in portion size and price increases for ingredients. This causes food operators to turn to salt — a cheaper alternative — to maintain flavour. \nTo address this trend, HPB had in September last year announced targets to get the population here to reduce sodium intake by 15 per cent in the next five years. \nIt also said then that it will make healthier salt and seasoning products more readily available to consumers, such as potassium salt that contains about half the amount of sodium compared to regular table salt. \nAlthough the National Population Health Survey showed that there was a decreasing prevalence of diabetes and high cholesterol among Singapore residents, the prevalence of hypertension continues to rise. \nJust 19.8 per cent of residents suffered from hypertension in 2010, but this figure rose to 35.5 per cent in the 2019-2020 study and 37 per cent in the 2021-2022 edition, MOH said. \nA diet high in sodium is a significant risk factor for hypertension, MOH and HPB said. \nEvery 1g increase in salt intake a day is associated with a nearly 10 per cent increase in hypertension risk, HPB said during a media briefing on Monday ahead of the release of its survey results. \nThe HPB's nutrition survey also found that people are eating more, with the average calorie intake increasing from 2,360kcal in 2019 to 2,410kcal in 2022. \nMore than half, or 61 per cent of the population, are exceeding their daily recommended calorie intake after factoring the energy required for physical activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

            "Article Body": "As a breast surgeon at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, I see six to eight cases of newly diagnosed breast cancer patients every week. \nBut it is no less difficult to break the bad news of metastasis — or the spread of cancer — to my patients and their loved ones.\nIt can be especially hard when it hits the young. Just recently, a colleague of mine lost his wife to breast cancer. \nShe was a medical officer whom I had worked with, and was only in her late 30s when she passed on. My colleague now has to bring up two young children on his own.\nBreast cancer is the most common cancer afflicting women globally, with no less than one in eight women expected to develop the disease in their lifetime. \nAlthough more commonly diagnosed in women aged 50 years or older, the global incidence of breast cancer in younger women has risen by 16 per cent since the 1990s and is currently the most common cancer in young women, with 244,000 cases diagnosed per year.\nFortunately, the survival rate of breast cancer has improved dramatically for most patients now due to the advancement of diagnostic and pathology assessment tools, surgical techniques, radiation precision, and new systemic treatment options for patients.\nThe key, however, still lies in the early detection and prevention of invasive breast cancer. If the disease is detected in its early stages, we can often perform breast-conserving surgery and even avoid chemotherapy.\nSingapore has established a national breast cancer screening programme since 2002, where women 50 years and above are invited to attend breast cancer screening biannually at a subsidised rate of S$50.\nWomen aged 40 to 49 years can also attend screening annually after discussion with their doctors regarding the benefits and limitations.\nWith the recent introduction of Healthier SG, breast cancer screening will be fully subsidised and free of charge for eligible women in the near future.\nDespite these measures, however, what is worrying is that our national take-up rate for breast cancer screening is low.\nStatistics from the National Population Health Survey show that it was about 40 per cent in 2019, a stark contrast to other developed nations like the United States and Sweden, which had take-up rates of 80-90 per cent in the same year.\nIn the latest available statistics in 2021, our overall breast cancer screening participation further dropped to 31.1 per cent, but this may be partially influenced by the Covid-19 pandemic and deferment of less urgent health services such as screening.  \nLocal researchers have attempted to shed light on this phenomenon of low screening uptake, which is especially perplexing for a highly-educated nation like ours.\nFour key themes were revealed from a local research conducted by a team from the Health Promotion Board, published in the Annals Academy of Medicine Singapore: \nI remember a patient called Madam Tan, a single mother in her early 50s who confessed that she did not attend screenings because she was the sole breadwinner and was too busy with work to provide for her two children, one of whom just recently enrolled in a university.\nShe was presented with locally advanced breast cancer which required urgent chemotherapy to control the further spread of the disease and shrink her cancer before surgery.\nHowever, she was worried about the effects of chemotherapy, which would affect her ability to work. She decided to delay treatment and seek help from alternative medicine instead, despite our repeated attempts advising her against doing so.\nSome months later, she was readmitted to the emergency department for vomiting and weakness. \nUnfortunately, her disease had progressed to Stage 4 and spread to her brain. She passed on peacefully shortly after, in the company of her loved ones.\nMadam Tan should be the exception and not the norm, but unfortunately, cases like hers are not uncommon in my practice.\nHer death is a reminder of the importance of attending regular breast cancer screenings and highlights the struggles that the women in our society face — juggling the pressures of providing for the family and taking care of one’s health.\nSadly, personal health often takes the backseat and gets neglected in the daily grind.\nAnother important lesson gleaned from Madam Tan’s case is to educate our youths on significant healthcare issues that plague our society today.\nStudies have shown that women are more likely to attend screening when they are encouraged and supported by their children. \nThis will become increasingly important with our low fertility rate and increasing life expectancy. The youths of today must be more involved in supporting our ageing society.\nRecently, I had the privilege of mentoring a group of university students who are passionate about raising breast cancer screening uptake in Singapore.\nThe team, “Mammobot”, aims to develop a chatbot which can be deployed over mobile and web-hosted platforms to educate the public on the importance of breast cancer screening, answer common questions pertaining to screening and provide a follow-up function to send mammogram screening appointment reminders.\nTeam Mammobot won the “Social Responsibility Award” with their prototype in this year’s Medical Innovation Grand Challenge organised by the National University of Singapore. The team has decided to use the prize money to further develop the prototype to benefit the public in the near future.\nNext month (October) marks the start of Breast Cancer Awareness month here and internationally. Various locations in Singapore will be lit up in pink in support, and a series of public campaigns and events will be held across our island.\nI am proud to say that Yishun Health and Khoo Teck Puat Hospital where I work will be part of these efforts in collaboration with Tzu Chi Foundation.\nIn addition to multi-lingual public education seminars on breast cancer and Healthier SG, we will organise sharing sessions by patient advocates on their personal breast cancer journeys. A Mammobus will also be deployed to facilitate screenings on-site.\nAs the event’s organising committee Chairman, I am very fortunate to be given the opportunity to put together an event to raise awareness for such a worthy cause.\nJust as heartening is the support I have received from medical and nursing students from our local universities.\nI believe that involving the youth of today in tackling national healthcare problems will reap benefits for society down the road. \nScreening and prevention of breast cancer is one of the nation’s focus under the Healthier SG strategy and we can certainly benefit from the additional creative energy of our younger generation, as part of an “all hands on deck battle” against this formidable disease. \n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:"

            "Article Body": "Headlines are buzzing with the excitement that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will soon designate Mounjaro to join Wegovy and Ozempic as the latest diabetes medication approved as weight loss drugs. \nIn Singapore, Wegovy was approved by the Health Sciences Authority earlier this year.\nWegovy and Ozempic can now also be prescribed for patients suffering from obesity under the discretion of a medical professional, and there have been reports of more patients requesting to be put on these drugs, despite not suffering from diabetes or being obese.\nAs these drugs enter the market, more questions arise about safety and who exactly should be using them. \nThese drugs have been a game changer for some people facing chronic and severe obesity who were unsuccessful in losing weight previously. \nI have heard the stories of countless numbers of individuals who have improved their health, beginning with a change in their mindset about their ability to make a change, followed by a programme that then helped them lose weight. No injections needed. \nDespite the existence of such weight loss programmes, globally, the health of many continues to decrease as their body fat continues to increase.\nSo it’s no wonder why there is so much excitement for a medical prescription approach to weight loss.  \nIn a society that prioritises quick fixes and instant gratification, these drugs are exciting. \nBut as a board-certified public health and preventive medicine physician, I have to ask: What is an approach that is focused on overall health and well-being that is well supported by science and is scalable for the good of the public? \nIt remains the tried-and-true combination of regular exercise, a balanced diet and lifestyle changes.  \nAntidiabetic drugs containing semaglutide, like Ozempic, are classed as GLP-1 agonist drugs, which are not new. \nThey were first approved by the FDA in 2005 to treat Type-2 diabetes. They work by lowering blood sugar levels and increasing satiety — that feeling of fullness — to prevent overeating. \nAnd while loss of hunger may cause you to eat less — does it cause you to eat healthy? Our bodies still need a constant daily consumption of important macro and micro nutrients.\nThese drugs have the potential to help people facing chronic and severe obesity who were unsuccessful in losing weight previously. \nHowever, there are potential risks and drawbacks. For instance, using them for weight loss without proper diet and exercise can result in decreased muscle density, malnutrition, cardiovascular impacts and other known issues. \nMost notably, the majority of patients who stop taking these drugs gain the weight back — repeating the frustrating cycle that so many people experience. \nSimply put, there is no silver bullet when it comes to losing weight. Sustainable weight loss is a lifelong commitment that starts with behavioral change. \nLong-term results happen by setting goals, being physically active, having a balanced diet, getting adequate sleep, and understanding how nutrition impacts your body. \nPeople will always need support in forming new habits and making sustainable changes — whether it’s losing weight, building muscle, or covering their nutritional needs through diet and supplements, where needed. \nIt can be challenging to stay motivated and this is where weight loss and wellness companies can provide the support needed to help people stay on course. \nThe positive impact of a support group was echoed by the majority (84 per cent) of consumers in a recent Herbalife Asia Pacific Health Priority Survey, which polled over 5,000 people across 11 countries, including Singapore. \nThe respondents also said the benefits of support groups included being able to share experiences and seek guidance and encouragement. \nIn addition, while weight loss products and supplements are not a substitute for those who need prescribed medication, they are one way to help people build the right habits that can serve them in the longer term.\nWithout a doubt, weight loss drugs are likely here to stay, and they have the potential to improve lives and open doors to people who can truly benefit from them. But good health is more than weight loss. \nThe ultimate goal is often more than a number on a scale — but overall improved health and a sense of well-being.  \nTo that end, an approach as a society to expand access to healthier foods, better nutrition education, a supportive community, increased norms that promote physical activity, and often a coach who can guide you on your journey remains the key elements to meet that goal.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR: \nDr Kent Bradley is the Chief Health and Nutrition Officer at health and wellness company Herbalife."

            "Article Body": "PARIS — Bystanders are less likely to give life-saving CPR to women having a cardiac arrest in public than men, leading to more women dying from the common health emergency, researchers said on Monday (Sept 18).\nCardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) combines mouth-to-mouth breathing and chest compressions to pump blood to the brain of people whose hearts have stopped beating, potentially staving off death until medical help arrives.\nIn research to be presented at a medical conference in Spain this week, but which has not yet been peer-reviewed, a team of Canadian doctors sought to understand how bystanders administer the procedure differently to men and women.\nThey looked at records of cardiac arrests that took place outside of hospitals in the United States (US) and Canada between 2005 and 2015, which included nearly 40,000 patients. \nOverall, 54 per cent of the patients received CPR from a bystander, the research said.\nFor cardiac arrests in a public place, such as in the street, 61 per cent of women were given CPR by a bystander — compared to 68 per cent of men. \nDr Alexis Cournoyer, an emergency physician at the Hopital du Sacre-Coeur de Montreal who conducted the research, told AFP that this gap \"increases women's mortality following a cardiac arrest — that's for sure\". \nCardiac arrests are a leading cause of death, with more than 350,000 occurring in the US alone every year, according to the American Heart Association.\nOnly around 10 per cent of people who have a sudden cardiac arrest outside of a hospital survive, research has shown. \nThe researchers sought to find a reason for the gender gap.\nOne theory was that bystanders in public could be uncomfortable touching a woman's breast without consent, Dr Cournoyer said.\nThe researchers looked into whether age could play a role, he added.\nBut it did not — women were less likely to receive CPR than men from a bystander regardless of their age, the data showed.\nDr Cournoyer said another possibility was a \"barrier of recognition\" for women having a cardiac arrest, which is often represented as something that happens only to men.\nBefore a cardiac arrest, men are more likely to have chest pain — a commonly depicted symptom in media — while women are more likely to experience shortness of breath, according to a study published last month in Lancet Digital Health.\nDr Cournoyer said further research was required to shed light on the gap between men and women, in particular involving data on the gender of those performing CPR. \nThe research, which the team plans to publish in a peer-reviewed journal, will be presented at the European Emergency Medicine Congress 2023 in Barcelona.

            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — Before you think of buying a whole box of durian mooncakes, be advised that people may be out to cheat you through online scams, and that it is going to add more fat to your body than eating the fruit itself.\nDurian season lasts from June to anywhere well into October and people have been known to pay top dollar for premium varieties of the tropical fruit.\nSingaporeans’ passion for the king of fruits can also be seen from their interest in novel durian-infused food — durian shakes, durian hotpot, durian coated with batter and deep-fried, durian paste piped into pastries and wrapped in glutinous rice balls, the list goes on.\nTheir love affair with durian extends even to their dating preferences.\nA new survey done by Bumble, a dating and social networking application, revealed that more than half of the people in Singapore polled were likely to consume durian this year, with one in five indicating their expectation to savour the fruit while on a date.\nAnother interesting finding was that almost one in three (29 per cent) of durian fans would turn down someone they are romantically interested in if the person did not like the fruit, which is known for its pungent smell and rich flavours that range from sweet to bitter.\nThe survey, done in April this year, polled 500 single people in Singapore aged 18 to 42.\nDurians can be considered a super fruit because of its high nutrient content.\nHowever, if they are packed with so much nutritional goodness, can they replace other fruits?\nAnd just how much durian should one eat in a sitting if one is worried about blood sugar levels and weight control?\nIs it true that one should never mix durians with alcohol?\nTODAY asked the experts to weigh in on these thorny issues.\nIt is often thought that it is unhealthy to eat durian but the fruit is a rich source of monounsaturated fats, or healthy fats.\nMs Bibi Chia, principal dietitian with Raffles Diabetes and Endocrine Centre, said that the main benefit of monounsaturated fats is its ability to lower bad cholesterol level, which in turn reduces one’s risk of heart disease and stroke.\nIt is also a myth that eating durian increases cholesterol levels, since it does not contain cholesterol and contains limited saturated fat, Ms Chia said.\n“When looking to reduce cholesterols levels, other parts of our diet that contributes more fat, cholesterol and calories should be first assessed,” she added.\nBesides fibre and vitamins such as A, B and C, durians are also rich in potassium, which is essential for maintaining normal functioning of all cells. Potassium maintains the balance of salt and fluid in the body to regulate blood pressure.\nAs an energy boost, durians are a good option. However, people who are watching their weight or have diabetes should be aware that it has a higher calorie and sugar content than other fruits such as apples and strawberries.\nDr Anuradha Negi, a specialist in endocrinology and consultant at Raffles Diabetes and Endocrine Centre, said that 100 grams (roughly three seeds) of Thai raw durian contain 165 calories and 29g of carbohydrates (equivalent to a bowl of rice).\nIn comparison, 100g of a red apple contains 57 calories and 13g of carbohydrates.\nMs Chia said that a 100g serving of durian contains three to four times the amount of carbohydrates than strawberries.\nIf you were to devour an entire small durian weighing about 600g, that would mean consuming about 990 calories — although this may vary depending on the variety. This is around half the daily calorie intake recommended for an average adult. \nThe high sugar content in durian will also cause blood glucose spikes when consumed excessively, Dr Negi said.\nFor people living with diabetes, uncontrolled and repeated blood sugar spikes can lead to serious complications such as heart disease, blindness, nerve damage and kidney problems.\nIt is not unusual for durian lovers to indulge in five or even 10 to 20 seeds at one go, but that would be considered excessive.\nThe experts advised limiting durian intake to one to three seeds every day, as one of the two daily servings of fruit.\nFor diabetics, limit durian intake to no more than two seeds a day. Ms Chia advised having them between meals to avoid sugar spikes and to avoid overloading the meal with too much carbohydrates.\nThe size of each durian kernel matters, too. For example, the Red Prawn and Black Pearl varieties tend to have smaller seeds.\n“Those with smaller seeds tend to have more flesh. This means that you will consume more calories and carbohydrates by eating more smaller seeds,” she said.\nIf you must have durians, it is recommended to eat two seeds of the fruit every day as part of a healthy diet, but switch around with other types of fruit.\n“Having a variety of fruit in our diet can help provide different nutrients.\n“Fruits like durian and banana are higher in carbohydrates and should be eaten in moderation,” Ms Chia added. \nConsuming too much durian and alcohol together may cause uncomfortable side effects.\nDepending on one’s tolerance, alcohol can cause nausea, bloating and dehydration, while overeating durians can lead to bloating and sugar spikes, Ms Chia said.\nIt is also thought that mixing the two may worsen hangovers, a set of symptoms that occur as a consequence of drinking too much alcohol. Typical symptoms are fatigue, excessive thirst, nausea, headaches, muscles aches and weakness. \nDr Negi explained that durians contain sulphur compounds that are known to slow the metabolism of alcohol in the body. This can potentially exacerbate alcohol-related intoxication. At the same time, the liver also has to process the fat and sugar content in durian.\nStudies in mice have not shown any conclusive evidence and more studies are required to understand the effects of durian on alcohol metabolism, but it would be prudent to avoid mixing the two, Dr Negi added.\nIt is worth mentioning that durians contain the amino acid tryptophan, which the body uses to make melatonin and serotonin.\nMelatonin is a hormone that regulates the sleep-wake cycle, while serotonin plays a role in regulating body functions such as mood, sleep, digestion and even appetite.\nWould consuming durian promote better sleep then? The jury is still out on this.\nDr Negi said that a study analysing the tryptophan content in three different varieties of durian found that it is present only in the Musang King variety — but in low amounts.\n“We cannot conclude with certainty that durian positively affects sleep,” she said.\nIf you are having sleep problems, you should avoid consuming too much fatty food such as durian, and eating it too late in the evening because that will affect digestion.\nTry other sleep-promoting habits instead. For example, improving your sleep hygiene and limiting caffeine intake in the afternoon or evening.\nWhen choosing between eating the fruit and a durian puff or cake to get your durian fix, opt for the fruit itself.\nDurian-infused treats and beverages are typically laden with way more sugar, (not-so-good) fat, carbohydrates and calories than the real deal.\nFor example, one raw durian seed contains 55 calories and 1.7g of fat but a small durian puff (30g) can easily contain more than 70 calories and almost 5g of fat. \nAs for that entire piece of durian mooncake (about 200g), it has more than 800 calories and around 42g of fat.\n“Enjoy these novelty foods only once in a while and limit the portion size,” Ms Chia said.\nPeople are often advised to drink salt water from a durian husk after eating the seeds to get rid of the smell and to reduce “heatiness”. Is there any truth to this?\nTraditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) physician Tay Jia Yin from Raffles Chinese Medicine said that from a TCM perspective, durian is considered a “heaty” food.\nThis means that it has “warming” properties that can lead to undesirable symptoms such as sore throat, mouth ulcers and increased phlegm production when people consume too much of it.\nTCM practitioners believe that salt water has the effect of reducing the heaty effects of durian, but there is no basis to support the practice of drinking it from a durian husk to get rid of the smell, Ms Tay said.\nPeople may also consider pairing durians with mint tea, chrysanthemum tea, green tea or coconut water to counter its “heaty” effects, she added."

            "Article Body": "NEW YORK — When adults exercise, they tend to have the same resolute look on their faces. Yet many experts say adopting a playful attitude toward working out benefits mental health, mixes up the workout and encourages people to keep moving.\nHere’s what you can do.\nDROP YOUR INHIBITIONS ABOUT MOVEMENT. For most people, movement stops being fun at the beginning of adolescence, when many stop playing games and competitive sports enter the picture, said Dr Matthew Ladwig, an assistant professor of integrative human health at Purdue University Northwest.\nMr Darryl Edwards, the founder of an exercise program called the Primal Play Method, said the key to rediscovering the fun of exercise is to tap into memories from before exercise became a chore.\nIn 2011, he left an investment banking job to become a personal trainer. He soon noticed that many clients seemed bored and realised he was often bored, too.\nSo he looked back to his childhood for inspiration. Mr Edwards began incorporating play into his workouts and his clients’: Climbing trees, balancing on railings and crawling on all fours instead of going to the gym.\nEventually, he developed a workout aimed at building strength and endurance through childlike play. His clients give piggyback rides and play tag instead of lifting weights.\nNot only do they get a solid workout, he said, it changes how they see movement. “Play is not the activity,” Mr Edwards said.\n“It’s the attitude you have.”\nFIND SMALL WAYS TO BE MORE CHILDLIKE. Dr Ladwig said children don’t move steadily for long periods of time. They stop and start: Chasing a ball, then playing a game.\nAsk a friend to kick a ball or throw a Frisbee with you. Or add bursts of running or skipping to your walks.\nIf balancing on railings or climbing trees sounds risky, bounce a ball while you walk the dog, or gamify it by giving yourself two points if you pass someone and deducting five if someone passes you.\nChildren also aren’t worried about making mistakes or looking silly while exercising. Try blasting your favorite song and dancing around the living room, said Ms Erica Nix, a trainer based in Austin, Texas.\nFor her online aerobics classes, Ms Nix dons vintage workout gear and acts out song lyrics.\n“I want to make it fun and silly, take out the perfectionism of it,” she said.\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

            "Article Body": "SINGAPORE — Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats and neighbourhoods will become more senior-friendly as Singapore’s population continues to age, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Sunday (Aug 20).\nIn his National Day Rally speech on Sunday night, Mr Lee highlighted that nearly one in four Singaporeans will be aged 65 and above by 2030. \n“Many seniors have told us that they want to live out their golden years in their own homes and neighbourhoods,” he added. \n“It is a familiar environment, a cosy sanctuary, and they have established deep roots and meaningful friendships. And this is a very good thing. We will help as many seniors to age in place as we can.” \nHomes will become more senior-friendly, with enhancements to the current Enhancement for Active Seniors, or Ease programme, he added. \nUnder the programme today, seniors can install fittings like ramps to help them get in and out of their homes, as well as grab bars and slip-resistant flooring in toilets, Mr Lee noted. \nSoon, seniors will be able to choose from an expanded suite of fittings under the enhanced programme, or Ease 2.0, he added. \nFor example, this includes foldable shower seats or widened toilet entrances for those who are wheelchair-bound, he added. \n\"And life can be safer and much more convenient,” said Mr Lee. \nEase was introduced to all towns in 2013. In April, HDB said that about 283,900 households have had elderly-friendly fittings installed under the programme. The programme was expanded in April to include features such as wheelchair lifters, which were previously offered as part of a pilot.\nSingapore will also make it safer and more comfortable for seniors to move about their neighbourhoods, said the Prime Minister. \nStreets and linkways frequented by seniors will be revamped and more shelters and rest points will be built, he added. \n“Also, more therapeutic gardens, fitness trails, and exercise machines, to encourage seniors to stay active,” Mr Lee said. \nRoads will also become more pedestrian-friendly, with measures like longer green man signals to give seniors more time to cross the road, barrier-free ramps and raised zebra crossings to help wheelchair users, as well as 3D road markings and narrowed roads to slow cars down, he said. \nThe Ministry of Transport announced in March that lifts will be added to more pedestrian overhead bridges to cater to Singapore’s ageing population.\nIn his speech on Sunday, Mr Lee said larger and more colourful signs with familiar symbols will be installed around HDB blocks, to help seniors remember their own block and find their way home. \nSingapore will also build more assisted living facilities “for those who need a little more help”, he said. \nIn a separate press release on Sunday, the Ministry of National Development and HDB said they will launch more Community Care Apartments, which integrate senior-friendly housing with customisable care services, “to enable seniors to age in place”. \n“We will keep making Singapore a more friendly home for current and future seniors,” said Mr Lee on Sunday. \n“We will do this across Singapore, starting with the towns with more seniors like Ang Mo Kio and Bukit Merah.” \nIn his speech, Mr Lee also stressed the role of active ageing and Singapore’s investment in healthcare for seniors. \n“The Government plays a big role in providing care, but seniors must also play our part to look after ourselves,” he added. \nNoting the launch of Healthier SG in July, the Prime Minister encouraged Singaporeans to sign up for the programme when they receive the invitation. \nBeyond their physical health, Mr Lee also stressed that “one of the biggest threats” to the well-being of seniors is loneliness.\n“Today, many seniors are living alone. They risk becoming socially isolated. Their spouses may have passed on, and their children are probably living elsewhere with their own families.” \nThe Government will do more to help seniors stay engaged and socially active, he said. \nFor example, active ageing centres have been set up all over the country, said Mr Lee, encouraging Singaporeans to bring their senior family members to join a nearby centre.\n“And if you are a senior yourself, I strongly encourage you to join a centre near you, because many seniors are having a good time there. Take the first step towards active ageing, so you can live well and age well.”\nThese steps are part of a new national programme called Age Well SG, which will complement Healthier SG, announced Mr Lee on Sunday. \nThe programme will be led by the health, transport and national development ministries. More details will be announced in future, said the National Development Ministry in its press release. \n“So we are taking major steps to prepare for a super-aged society,” said Mr Lee. \n“Together, we will make Singapore an endearing home for all ages, where seniors can age with dignity and grace, connected with friends and family.” CNA\nFor more reports like this, visit cna.asia."

            "Article Body": "An expert from Bioskin sheds light on this common skin condition and its multifaceted causes.\nYou’ve likely encountered these common beliefs: “Only teenagers get acne”, “Popping pimples gets rid of them more quickly” or “Acne is caused by eating too much chocolate and greasy food”.\nThese notions often trivialise the complexities of acne and can be misleading, said Ms Chanel Tay, assistant training manager at Bioskin, an established beauty salon in Singapore. Acne, she explained, is primarily caused by factors such as excess oil production, clogged pores and bacteria.\n“While cleansing helps remove surface dirt and oil, acne can still occur due to factors like hormonal imbalances and genetics. Over-washing or harsh scrubbing can irritate the skin and exacerbate acne,” she added.\nContrary to popular belief, acne affects individuals of all ages, including adults. “Hormonal changes, stress, diet and genetics can all contribute to acne development beyond the teenage years,” shared Ms Tay. “Hormonal acne is linked to the overproduction of sebum (an oily substance in skin glands), which clogs pores. Though often unavoidable, hormonal acne can be treated to prevent future breakouts.”\nFor individuals genetically predisposed to acne, Ms Tay recommends taking a proactive approach to managing acne. This includes selecting non-comedogenic products that won't block pores or worsen breakouts, as well as scheduling regular facial treatments.\nAs for popping or squeezing pimples, Ms Tay cautioned that this may worsen inflammation, increase the risk of scarring and spread bacteria, leading to more breakouts. “It’s best to leave pimples alone and allow them to heal naturally or seek professional treatment,” she advised.\nWhen it comes to diet choices playing a role in acne development, Ms Tay said that chocolate has been unfairly blamed as a trigger for acne, but there is limited evidence linking chocolate consumption directly to acne.\nGreasy foods themselves are also not the main culprit behind acne breakouts. According to Ms Tay, these foods are often eaten together with high-carbohydrate meals, which can trigger acne by promoting inflammation and influencing hormone levels.\n\nConsuming simple carbohydrates like refined grains and sugars can cause a rapid spike in insulin levels. The increase in insulin prompts higher levels of androgen hormones and IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) in the bloodstream. Consequently, this hormonal surge accelerates skin cell growth and boosts sebum production, contributing to clogged pores and acne.\nMAKING INFORMED DECISIONS TO IMPROVE SKIN HEALTH\n\nFor acne sufferers seeking a comprehensive treatment programme, Ms Tay recommends Bioskin’s Skin Purifying Face Treatment, which prioritises advanced technologies and specialised products over traditional extraction methods to tackle acne.\n“Our non-invasive approach includes using ultrasonic exfoliation to clear debris from the skin and draw out excess oils, whiteheads and blackheads, followed by a high-frequency device to kill germs and bacteria that cause inflammation,” Ms Tay explained.\nThe key ingredient used in this 10-step treatment is professional-grade salicylic acid, which penetrates the skin to dissolve dead skin cells, regulate oil secretion and lighten blemishes.\nTo address acne concerns effectively, Ms Tay emphasised the importance of examining the factors that contribute to acne development. “While we cannot alter our genetics or hormone levels, we can manage certain lifestyle choices that influence acne breakouts,” she said. “This includes maintaining good hygiene practices and adopting a balanced diet.”\nIn addition, Ms Tay recommends establishing a comprehensive skincare routine that encompasses gentle cleansing, moisturising and the use of non-comedogenic acne treatments. Individuals should also prioritise adequate rest, regular exercise, proper hydration and effective stress management to boost overall skin health.\nNew customers can try Bioskin’s Skin Purifying Face Treatment at a special price of S$38* (before GST). Terms and conditions apply.\nIndividual results may vary."

            "Article Body": "In the age of artificial intelligence, the Singapore Institute of Technology is harnessing its potential to reshape education through a competency-based approach. \n“In the realm of education, artificial intelligence (AI) is not just a tool,” said Professor George Siemens, chief scientist of Southern New Hampshire University’s Human Systems – an organisation that builds resources to respond to the systemic impact of AI on learning and wellness. “It is a thinking partner, one that changes our cognition.” \nRecognised for his pioneering work on how technology influences education, Prof Siemens was speaking at the recent CBExchange APAC 2024 in Singapore. Organised by the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) in partnership with the Competency-Based Education Network, the conference gathered thought leaders to explore the evolving landscape of education in the digital age.\nIndeed, AI is not just transforming industries but also recalibrating the labour market and precipitating a shift in core competencies. This rapid evolution presents a challenge for the education sector in bridging the widening gap between the skills of today’s workforce and those required by the job market.\nThe solution, according to Prof Siemens, lies in embracing a new educational approach, one increasingly recognised as vital in our AI-driven era: Competency-based education.\nA NEW PARADIGM OF LEARNING \nIn competency-based education, mastering skills and knowledge isn’t just about what you know but how well you apply it. In today’s dynamic job market, characterised by rapid technological advancements, this educational framework proves both agile and responsive.\nAddressing a pressing concern in modern education, Prof Siemens underscored the challenge universities face in assessing the authenticity of student performance. “With AI’s ability to generate assignments, how do we accurately assess student capabilities?” he said.\nCompetency-based education offers a compelling solution by shifting the focus to practical skill application rather than mere acquisition. Within this framework, proficiency in utilising AI itself becomes a competency that students will have to master in order to achieve their learning goals effectively.\nMoreover, this educational approach is designed to align educational outcomes with the evolving demands of the job market. By leveraging AI’s capabilities, curriculum development can be tailored to match real-world workforce requirements. This backward-design methodology ensures that educational pathways directly address the skills gap, enhancing graduates’ employability.\nDuring her presentation at CBExchange APAC 2024, Associate Professor May Lim, assistant provost (Applied Learning) at SIT, shared how competency-based education and stackable micro-credentials revolutionise learning. “With the help of AI and big data, we can quickly gather industry insights, enabling educational institutions to refine their offerings to equip students with the relevant skills to meet tomorrow’s challenges,” she said.\nEMPOWERING ADULT LEARNERS THROUGH AI \nSIT spearheaded the competency-based education model last year with the launch of its Applied Computing degree programme. Alongside, it introduced stackable micro-credentials and recognition of prior learning as key components of its adult education offerings. \nAssoc Prof Lim said: “As a forward-looking university, it’s crucial that we embrace change and offer flexible and accessible education pathways. This is vital for adult learners juggling multiple commitments while pursuing further education.”\nThe integration of AI’s adaptive learning technologies provides opportunities for highly personalised education, allowing content delivery that can be adapted to each learner’s pace and preferences. It also broadens the spectrum of assessment methods while ensuring comprehensive feedback. Assoc Prof Lim explained: “AI tutors can transform the feedback process by offering multifaceted perspectives, unlike the traditional method that relies on a single source.” \nA unique challenge encountered by students pursuing stackable micro-credentials is the asynchronous nature of the lessons, which allows for self-paced learning. “While independent learning offers flexibility, we recognise the value of collaborative learning. This is where AI peers can come into play alongside human peers with different schedules. This can make the learning process more interactive and supportive while accommodating the hectic schedules of adult learners,” she elaborated. \nNAVIGATING ETHICAL FRONTIERS WITH INTEGRITY\nAs educators explore the vast potential of AI, ethical considerations remain paramount. Stressing the necessity for openness and clarity in AI-related processes, Assoc Prof Lim said: “Ensuring transparency in how data is utilised is fundamental for building trust between students and educational institutions.”\nExpanding on this ethical imperative, Prof Siemens added: “Every phase – from data collection and model building to deployment and assessment – demands meticulous attention to safety, equity and ethics. It is critical that technological advancements contribute to a learning environment that is both fair and secure.”\nLooking ahead, Prof Siemens envisions AI as a catalyst for deeper inquiry into the human condition. “We’re at a crossroads, questioning what it means to be human in a technology-driven world,” he mused. “The hope is that AI will guide us in asking the right questions about human identity – and in so doing, elevate our understanding and enrich the human experience.”   \nLearners who are keen to upskill themselves can discover the array of courses offered by the Singapore Institute of Technology."

            "Article Body": "Shopee aims to deliver a seamless and reliable experience from order placement to fulfilment. \nLast September, as the weather grew increasingly hazy, Mr Gerald Lim, a computer programmer, knew he had to act quickly to find a solution. \n“My child, who is sensitive to airborne particles, was struggling with persistent sniffles,” he explained. “I urgently needed an air purifier to improve indoor air quality, especially on days when the environment turned less favourable.” \nBrowsing the assortment of vouchers and promotions on the Shopee mobile app, Mr Lim discovered the guaranteed next-day delivery (NDD) option. “Thanks to the NDD service, the air purifier arrived at my doorstep the following day,” he said. \nMr Kel Jin Chua, director of Shopee Singapore, highlighted that the introduction of NDD last August reflects the company’s commitment to enhancing customer experience and meeting the growing demand for expedited delivery options. “Shopee is focused on delivering effective solutions for pressing needs, such as securing a last-minute gift or replacing a faulty mobile phone,” said Mr Chua.\nHOW NEXT-DAY DELIVERY WORKS\nSince the launch of the service, Shopee has been working with logistics partner, SPX Express, to ensure the swift delivery of orders when customers opt for NDD as their delivery method. At SPX, a round-the-clock process facilitating NDD begins in the late afternoon and continues till nightfall. During this time, drivers collect parcels from sellers and transport them to SPX’s sorting centres where they are sorted overnight by specialised machines. \nParcels are scanned at each stage of the journey for accurate record keeping. For instance, upon reaching the sorting centre, they undergo both weighing and scanning procedures.\nPost-sorting, parcels are grouped by delivery areas and matched with their respective delivery bag or pallet. Thereafter, they are moved to delivery hubs across Singapore. Drivers load parcels into vans and embark on their delivery routes by 8am. \nFrom meticulous sorting to the precise coordination of delivery routes, each step is designed to ensure the timely arrival of customers’ orders.\nCOLLECTION POINTS FOR CONVENIENCE\nIn addition to NDD, Shopee provides access to 2,000 collection points located throughout Singapore, including minimarts, mobile phone stores, opticians, lockers and shopping malls. This option is ideal for customers who anticipate being unavailable to receive their deliveries at home.\nStructured to prioritise ease, most Shopee users will be able to find a collection point within a five-minute walk from their home or workplace. The most popular collection points serve over 300 Shopee customers daily and the number is set to rise.      \n     \nMr Lim often uses the Shopee collection point at a nearby convenience store when buying small items. “Since I’m not always at home, picking up my purchases on my way back from work is really convenient,” he said.\nTo optimise his limited time at home on weekends, Mr Ravi Singh, a full-time national serviceman, purchases necessities like toiletries and household goods on Shopee once or twice a week.\nHe, too, has reaped benefits from using the Shopee collection point service: “Shipping costs quickly add up when I buy items from multiple sellers, so it helps that delivery to collection points is free.” \nMr Singh retrieves his parcels from the convenience store located beneath his block. “Not only is the process hassle-free, I also have peace of mind knowing that my purchases are securely stored at the shop,” he added.       \nRECEIVE YOUR 4.4 HAUL IN A JIFFY\nAt major shopping events such as the 4.4 sale, users can anticipate an expanding array of products eligible for NDD.\nAmid the bustling excitement, shoppers can rest assured that Shopee remains dedicated to delivering orders promptly. \nSaid Mr Chua: “At Shopee, we place shoppers at the heart of all we do. Based on feedback obtained through Shopee chat and emails, we consistently adapt our features and services to meet evolving needs and provide users with an enjoyable online shopping experience.”\nSelect Shopee’s guaranteed next-day delivery option when making a purchase and enjoy the platform’s exceptional service and convenience throughout your online shopping journey.\n "

            "Article Body": "The National STEM Championship showcases young innovators going beyond book smarts to pit their analytical, scientific and communication skills against one another.\nIt’s the time of the year again when secondary school students in Singapore dive into challenges that reveal how science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) impact our lives.\nFormerly known as the National Science Challenge, the National STEM Championship (NSTEMC) aims to highlight emerging technologies and spark a passion for STEM subjects among students and the wider public.\nIn addition to the usual quizzes and tasks, NSTEMC participants are thrust into real-world scenarios during Onsite Challenges, where they must devise innovative solutions within a tight timeframe.\nDr Wu Yan, principal scientist at the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), commended this year’s finalists for their demonstration of critical thinking and creativity. “They sought innovative approaches and drew from personal experiences to tackle problems, showcasing a remarkable ability to think outside the box.”\nSURPRISES AND SECOND CHANCES\nThe victors of this year’s NSTEMC were the students from Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) (ACS (I)). The first, second and third runners-up were the students from Raffles Institution (RI), Raffles Girls’ School (RGS) and Temasek Junior College (TJC) respectively. All the teams comprised 15-year-old Secondary Three students.\nAny one of the finalists could have won – or been eliminated – thanks to the competition’s hands-on interdisciplinary focus, which demanded quick thinking and resourcefulness.\nACS (I) member Emmanuel Soon recalled the team sacrificing weekends and after-school hours to develop a prototype for a solar dryer using limited materials. As team member Ken Yokota Soh revealed, they diligently pored over videos and challenges from past competitions.\nYet, unexpected twists, like the task of constructing ball-and-stick models of organic molecules from memory during the quarter finals, took them by surprise. “After the time was up, we had only built one model,” recounted team member Reyes Lee.\nTo secure a spot in the grand finals, the ACS (I) team relied on the Wildcard Round, a crucial second chance. Said team member Aiden Lim: “It opened our eyes to the scope of the challenge and drove us to produce our best work and expand our scientific knowledge.”\nRGS, too, got a shot at redemption during the Wildcard Round. Teammates Claire-Leia Ng and Janhvi (who goes by one name) made a nerve-wracking dash to complete numerous tasks and questions on topics spanning zoology to programming in under one hour.\nThe team’s elation upon learning of their advancement to the grand finals was palpable, as they realised that their efforts had finally borne fruit.\nCOMMUNICATING STEM TO A WIDER AUDIENCE\nThe NSTEMC placed a premium on strong collaborative and communication skills, ensuring that participants could convey their knowledge in easily understood presentations and responses.\nJudge Dr Aniq Ahsan, a scientist at the Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology at A*STAR and technical advisor to the National Climate Change Secretariat at the Prime Minister’s Office, enjoyed the creative team presentations, which included start-up pitches, commercials and skits. Another judge, Dr Li Jingmei, group leader of the Laboratory of Women’s Health and Genetics at A*STAR, appreciated how teams crafted compelling narratives to bring scientific concepts and equations to life – some even incorporated aspects of Singapore’s history.\nFellow judge Assistant Professor Yvonne Gao, Centre for Quantum Technologies at the National University of Singapore, agreed, noting the teams’ confidence and their ability to articulate strategies and scientific rationale.\nAPPLYING STEM PRINCIPLES TO THE REAL WORLD\nDuring an Onsite Challenge visit to the National Kidney Foundation, the teams had a firsthand look at how STEM advancements improve patients’ lives. “The teams demonstrated a keen interest in learning and actively engaged with the experts and facilities they visited,” said judge Dr Lee Song Choon, director of KidsSTOP, Events and Engagement, at Science Centre Singapore:\nIndeed, the RI team said that the championship has inspired them to pursue STEM careers aimed at improving future standards of medical care and welfare.\nAddison Ang expressed his fascination with medical technology, while Harry Zhong Zihe noted that the study of medicine is a meaningful pursuit. Linus Ong hopes to explore precision medicine – which creates targeted, personalised treatment based on a patient’s data – while Swaagat Bikash Saikia is keen to explore natural language processing to create data-driven models that can address global community challenges.\nJudge Dr Felix Lena Stephanie, senior lecturer at the Nanyang Technological University’s School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, said the annual NSTEMC is a celebration of innovation, creativity and collaboration among young minds.\n“Viewers should tune in, not just to see the impressive technical prowess on display, but to be inspired by our nation’s emerging STEM leaders. They turn academic theories into tangible solutions while navigating unexpected challenges. It’s not just a competition, but a testament to Singapore’s commitment to nurturing future-forward thinkers and innovators.”\nCatch the National STEM Championship 2023 on mewatch."

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "Level up your confidence with compression wear and waist trainers that provide contouring solutions for women at every life stage.\nIn an age shaped by digital influences, the relentless pursuit of unrealistic body ideals fuelled by media exposure and societal norms has thrust an unnecessary weight on women.  \nIn an effort to democratise body shaping, Ms Jas Chua launched Lazywaist Co, a solutions-based shapewear company. “Shapewear can be harnessed as a tool of empowerment. This led us to create a line that is backed by science and can help women feel and look better in a safe manner,” said Ms Chua. \nMATERIAL MATTERS\nGuided by the principles of effectiveness, comfort and a personalised approach to body contouring, Ms Chua’s goal was to make shapewear accessible to women in all seasons of their lives. \nOne key factor that enhances the wearability and versatility of Lazywaist’s products is the meticulous selection of material. “Our compression shaping range featuring The Slim (high-waisted sculpting pants) and The Sculpt (an arm-shaping top) is crafted from the same medical-grade material used by South Korean plastic surgeons in post-liposuction compression wear,” she said. \nShe pointed out that numerous patients in South Korea who had undergone liposuction were required to wear compression garments continuously for a minimum of 72 hours. As such, it was imperative for the material to be moisture-wicking, comfortable and lightweight. \nSimilar attention to detail went into developing The Fix, a double-layered zipper shaper that targets the midsection.\n“The Fix is crafted from neoprene, a material commonly found in wetsuits. In addition to being soft and lightweight, neoprene naturally retains heat. Women who wish to enhance sweat production during a workout session can consider wearing the garment under their gym-wear,” said Ms Chua.  \nBeyond its functional qualities, shapewear can also feel luxurious. The Desire, a contouring underwear from the Lazywaist collection, touts intricate lace detailing, lending it a sumptuous finish. \nEFFECTIVE COMPRESSION WITHOUT DISCOMFORT\nCompression wear refers to snug, elastic clothing designed to compress and provide support to underlying tissues in the body and limbs. This concept is thought to mitigate the effects of gravity and promote improved posture and wound healing.\nSuch garments are widely used in sports to boost blood circulation and ease muscle swelling after workouts, and harnessed in medical therapy to address conditions such as varicose veins.\nLazywaist’s compression range offers compression levels that closely resemble those found in medical-grade compression wear. “Doctors typically prescribe compression wear with levels at 40mmHg and above while our products feature compression levels of 35mmHg. This slightly lower figure ensures comfort for daily wear while still providing nearly identical benefits,” explained Ms Chua.\nIllustrating her point, Ms Chua shared that The Slim is expected to provide double the compression compared to regular yoga pants.\nLazywaist’s compression and shapewear range is a favourite among air stewardesses, offering support during long periods of standing and helping them maintain a sleek physique in their fitted uniforms.\nThe Lazywaist collection has been put to the test by a diverse group of women, including four mum-influencers – Ms Mongchin Yeoh, Ms Cheryl Chin, Ms Melissa Koh and Ms Selina Ong – who shared their experience at the brand’s launch on Sep 19.\nFirst-time mothers Ms Yeoh and Ms Chin have discovered The Slim to be a valuable addition to their regimens.\nFor Ms Yeoh, it has become an essential companion on long-haul flights, ensuring improved lower body circulation. She reflected: “I’ve noticed a reduction in water retention and my body appears less bloated.” \nMeanwhile, Ms Chin has integrated The Slim into her fitness sessions, boosting compression during her gym and Pilates workouts. Additionally, it helps her achieve a more streamlined figure.\nPOSTPARTUM BODY SHAPING\nIt is important to align one’s shaping objectives with the right shapewear, especially when addressing a specific need such as postpartum body shaping. Ms Chua shared that the postpartum period is often regarded as “a golden phase of recovery”, characterised by pelvic expansion and “a more adaptable body state”, making postpartum binders beneficial in contouring and supporting the abdominal area. \nWhile waist training is a common practice in European countries, there are limited products designed to suit the Asian physique in the market, said Ms Chua.\nFor this reason, Lazywaist developed a waist training collection tailored for Asian body types, comprising The Fix and The Shape (a waist trainer with nine-steel boning). “The latter is ideal for new mothers, serving as a postpartum binder to gently sculpt the waistline by tucking in ‘tummy pouches’,” she explained.\nMs Yeoh shared that she paired The Shape with Lazynote, an in-house eight-week waist training programme with prescribed specific wear hours. “When used in concert, the regimen offered effective waist support. Just a few hours of daily wear made me feel like I was on my way to reclaiming my pre-pregnancy shape,” she said.\nA third-time mother, Ms Koh revealed that the Lazywaist range marked her introduction to waist trainers and compression wear. “The team encouraged me to progress at my own pace with Lazynote and I still managed to achieve pleasing results,” she said.\nTo round out a holistic postpartum shaping routine, women can incorporate The Slim into their regime – these sculpting pants can help manage postpartum swelling in the thighs, hips and calves due to their compression properties.\nIn support of new mothers, Lazywaist has curated a special postpartum bundle for full-body contouring.\nAnd to facilitate the breastfeeding experience, women can try the seamless and wire-free Love-me-Tender nursing bra. Engineered with comfort and convenience in mind, the bra features an ultra-soft breathable nylon-spandex blend and includes sewn-in padding, making washing hassle-free without the need to remove separate pads.\n“I’ve tried various nursing bras in the past but Love-me-Tender stands out as the most comfortable and cooling option. I appreciate how the bra provides support without underwire,” said Ms Koh. \nSHAPING GOALS ACROSS LIFE STAGES\nWomen of all life stages can benefit from wearing shapewear regularly or for special occasions. “The advantages include having better posture and enhanced confidence, resulting from a sleeker and more polished appearance,” said Ms Chua.\nMum-preneur Ms Ong, a co-founder of a luxury hair salon, is a fan of The Shape for its ability to refine her silhouette. She said: “I wear it daily and appreciate the posture and back support it provides, especially since I spend long hours on my feet in heels at work.”\nAcknowledging that unrealistic body standards can have detrimental effects on an individual’s self-image, Ms Chua believes that embracing yourself no matter your body type is the first step to feeling good. \n“Good shapewear can give you that extra boost by helping you fit better in clothes, but true beauty arises from finding contentment within yourself,” she said. \nTo meet your shaping objectives, browse the full Lazywaist shapewear range online.

            "Article Body": "NTUC LearningHub’s exclusive partnership with TÜV SÜD offers a job-ready certification that is financially accessible and endorsed by prominent companies.\nIn the realm of corporate sustainability, action speaks louder than words. It involves intentionally embedding green practices into every facet of business operations and overarching strategy.\nFor many businesses, navigating the array of challenges and opportunities presented by sustainability can be daunting. NTUC LearningHub’s Special Report 2022 on Sustainability found that while nine in 10 business leaders recognised the importance of integrating sustainability into their business strategy, 41 per cent cited the lack of specialised talent or expertise as a barrier to setting sustainability goals.\nEven when companies manage to formulate sustainability strategies, they often encounter roadblocks: 47 per cent of respondents identified a dearth of expertise as an obstacle in shaping these strategies. In addition, 86 per cent of business leaders agreed that there was a gap in expertise and skill sets required for steering sustainability initiatives within their organisation.\nTo bridge this knowledge gap and empower more companies and business professionals to embrace sustainable practices, NTUC LearningHub has collaborated with the academy division of TÜV SÜD in Singapore, an internationally recognised provider of safety, quality, security and sustainability solutions, to introduce the Professional Certification in Business Sustainability Management ISO Standards.\nINDUSTRY-LEADING EDUCATION FROM PROMINENT PROVIDERS\nNTUC LearningHub, committed to enhancing the employability of working individuals through continuous education and training, has been a driving force since 2004, having assisted over 29,000 organisations and provided more than 2.6 million training opportunities.\nCommenting on its exclusive partnership with TÜV SÜD in Singapore in launching the Professional Certification in Business Sustainability Management ISO Standards, Mr Tay Ee Learn, chief sector skills officer of NTUC LearningHub, highlighted the expertise of TÜV SÜD in facilitating the adoption and maintenance of rigorous ISO sustainability standards.\nMr Tay said: “Not only will the certification address the rising demand for sustainability-trained professionals, it also supports graduates and mid-career professionals who aspire to equip themselves with market-ready competencies to take on in-demand sustainability-related job roles.”\nTÜV SÜD in Singapore, a wholly owned subsidiary of TÜV SÜD AG, specialises in testing, inspection, certification, auditing and training services.

Through a global workforce exceeding 26,000 employees across more than 1,000 locations, TÜV SÜD adds value to customers and partners by enabling market access and managing risks to create a safer and more sustainable future.\nEXCELLING IN SUSTAINABILITY\nThe Professional Certification in Business Sustainability Management has been well-received by participants eager to elevate their workplace contributions and careers.\nMr Au Yang Sian, director and regional head of operations planning and inventory at Zuellig Pharma Holdings, said that one module – the ISO 22301:2019 Business Continuity Management System Implementer Training – offered a particularly engaging learning experience.\n“The programme’s thoughtful design incorporates ample opportunities for class discussion, engaging video content that enhances understanding, and practical exercises to facilitate the application of acquired concepts. Additionally, it offers a preparatory online component, allowing busy professionals to access the material at their own pace and preferred timing through a user-friendly platform,” he shared.\nHis colleague Shamsir Ali, a regional quality assurance and health, safety, security and environment manager, called the module an “enlightening experience”. Said Mr Shamsir: “The comprehensive content gives us an in-depth understanding of business continuity management, equipping us with the knowledge and skills necessary for practical application in real-world scenarios.”\nIntended for sustainability and sustainability-linked professionals, including facilities and operations managers, strategy consultants, finance managers and environment professionals, the certification offers two tracks: Facility and cybersecurity.\nParticipants of the facility track undergo a specialised module titled ISO 41001:2018 Facility Management Systems Implementer Training, while those on the cybersecurity track have the opportunity to attend the Cybersecurity Essentials and Trustmark course.\nBoth tracks encompass essential modules covering pertinent subjects, such as business continuity, information security, anti-bribery and energy management. The tailored curriculum imparts universal sustainability principles and best practices that can be adapted across diverse industries.\nThe tracks empower participants to tackle environmental challenges, such as transitioning to renewable energy, making data centres more sustainable, meeting sustainability reporting requirements and optimising carbon credits.\nAccording to Mr Zack Lee of Greensafe International, the certification’s ISO 22301:2019 Business Continuity Management System Implementer Training module has enhanced his proficiency in developing and overseeing robust business continuity plans. Much like Mr Au and Mr Shamsir, he enjoyed the interactive style of learning, which encourages engagement with both instructors and peers.\nACCESS TO FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR JOB-READY LEARNING\nThe Professional Certification in Business Sustainability Management is designed to be accessible to those passionate about driving sustainability in the business world.\nDepending on the funding programme offered, both individuals and corporate-sponsored participants can enjoy up to 70 per cent SkillsFuture Singapore funding for course fees. In addition, corporate-sponsored learners under the Career Conversion Programme or Place-and-Train Programme receive between 70 and 90 per cent salary support during the course.\nThe certification boasts a flexible learning structure with stackable credentials, encompassing five modules to be completed within two years. Embracing a learner-centric approach, the curriculum employs a flipped classroom technique that entails e-learning, classroom instruction and project-based work.\nUpon completing all modules, participants undergo a job-readiness assessment by TÜV SÜD in Singapore, culminating in a professional certificate endorsed by both NTUC LearningHub and TÜV SÜD in Singapore.\nMr Richard Hong, CEO of TÜV SÜD ASEAN, said: “In launching the stackable ISO credential pathway, we are not only equipping individual professionals with widely recognised qualifications applicable across industries but also empowering them to become invaluable contributors to businesses on their sustainability journey. Besides enhancing employability, this initiative opens doors to in-demand roles across various growth sectors, catalysing a transformative workforce primed for a sustainable future.”\nEnquire and sign up for the TÜV SÜD Professional Certification in Business Sustainability Management at NTUC LearningHub today."

            "Article Body": "Through its innovative degree programmes and campus-wide initiatives, James Cook University is doing its part to drive sustainable practices in Singapore.\nFor many students, a typical souvenir from one’s university would be a T-shirt, a decorative wall pennant or perhaps a school-branded notebook. \nAt the Singapore campus of James Cook University (JCU), keepsakes take on a more profound significance, intertwining eco-consciousness with a sense of purpose. Bolstered by seed funding earmarked for sustainability, the university recently acquired a plastic recycling machine, transforming plastic waste into meaningful souvenirs for its students, said Professor May Tan-Mullins, JCU’s dean international and chief sustainability officer.\nThis is only one aspect of JCU’s dedication to sustainability, which extends beyond its campus borders and takes shape in diverse efforts. They include on-site innovations like installing energy-efficient photocell-controlled lighting and using an eco-shredder to recycle branches and leaves into compost, as well as broader collaborative pursuits, such as partnering with Singapore National Employers Federation to instil sustainability-focused training.\nA pivotal testament to JCU’s commitment is the introduction of the Bachelor of Business and Environmental Science programme at its Singapore campus. The degree programme seeks to equip graduates with the essential skills to shape effective environmental strategies for businesses and guide them into a more sustainable future.\nLEADING THE CHARGE IN SUSTAINABILITY\nIn line with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set out by the United Nations, JCU is actively supporting the Ministry of Education’s target of a two-thirds reduction in net carbon emissions from the education sector by 2030, as well as the Singapore Green Plan 2030 agenda on sustainable development.\nProf Tan-Mullins, who also leads JCU Singapore’s Sustainability Working Group, which was established in April last year, said JCU’s commitment stems from the belief that a united societal effort is necessary to address global sustainability concerns and build a more inclusive and resilient future for the world.\n“Universities are hotspots for innovation and learning, with the power to extend the impact to surrounding communities and society. By educating students and staff about what they can do for sustainability, we can cultivate change agents and drive progress across various SDGs,” she said.\nTo realise this vision, JCU leverages its research clusters – such as the Sustainability Research Cluster and the Ethics, Organisations and Society Research Cluster – to spearhead its multifaceted and interdisciplinary approaches in studying sustainability.\nUNITING BUSINESS AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE\nThis same approach informs the Bachelor of Business and Environmental Science programme, housed within the JCU Singapore Business School – an institution accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). The AACSB distinction is held by less than 6 per cent of university-level business schools worldwide.\nTo align the programme with industry needs and prevailing best practices in Singapore, the university collaborated with businesses to identify their requirements within the environmental sector, customising its academic components and learning outcomes accordingly.\nAccording to Prof Tan-Mullins, the programme’s uniqueness lies in its blend of business acumen and environmental expertise. Students undertake both business and environmental science subjects, including electives in areas like aquaculture, coastal and marine management, and field studies in tropical geography. As they gain an understanding of biodiversity and ecology, they will also be trained in economics, accounting and management.\nThis comprehensive approach empowers graduates to navigate a business landscape where environmental considerations increasingly drive consumer choices, and prepares them for environmental, social and governance roles in both public and private sectors.  \n“Our faculty possesses extensive understanding of Singapore’s sustainability demands and skilfully integrates these elements into the curriculum,” said Prof Tan-Mullins. “Their diverse expertise and ongoing research enable them to guide students in tackling region-specific environmental challenges.”\nFor students aspiring to propel Singapore’s sustainability journey, she advises embracing curiosity, fostering interdisciplinary thinking and developing critical thinking skills. “Harness your passion,” she added, “to bring about positive change on the path to creating a more sustainable world.”\nEnrol in the AACSB-accredited Bachelor of Business and Environmental Science programme at James Cook University in Singapore, and be a force for positive change in the world."

            "Article Body": "From stackable programme offerings to tailored consultancy services and strategic alliances, the Singapore University of Social Sciences is building sustainability capabilities for the future.\nWhat does ‘social good’ mean to you? While the term might evoke images of food drives or fundraising efforts for worthy causes, Professor Ang Hak Seng of the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) envisions a more profound impact that transcends the present day.\n“At SUSS, we believe that social good encompasses the creation of a community and an environment for future generations,” said Prof Ang, who serves as the director of the Centre of Excellence for Social Good (CESG), SUSS.\nCESG goes beyond its role as a think tank focused on advancing social good; it also serves as a catalyst for building social alliances and plays a pivotal role in developing the capacity of the people sector at a national level. Added Prof Ang: “CESG is committed to equipping sectors with the necessary skills to embrace social good causes such as sustainability. We conduct research on how organisations can do good, do right and do well, which is a delicate balancing act. Through this research, we develop best practices to help the ecosystem to rapidly scale up their sustainability practices.”\nSustainability takes on an interdisciplinary approach at SUSS, addressing not just environmental concerns but also the complex web of social and business challenges. In addition to launching a suite of graduate-level sustainability management programmes, the university has formalised a partnership through a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with professional services firm RSM.\nThis alliance aims to empower small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) in Singapore to integrate sustainability into their operations and business models. The focus on SMEs is a strategic one, as these businesses lack the capacity to readily hire sustainability experts due to their smaller size and resource constraints. However, as SMEs employ more than 70 per cent of Singapore’s workforce, they have the potential to generate a substantial and widespread influence on Singapore’s sustainability landscape.\n“Embarking on sustainability can strengthen SMEs. It builds business resilience within the supply chain, reduces operational costs through process optimisation and drives innovation, enabling SMEs to venture into new markets,” noted Prof Ang. “An SME that refuses to adopt sustainable practices may risk alienating younger consumers and miss out on attracting fresh talent by failing to align with the values of the younger generation.”\nGUIDING SMES ON THEIR SUSTAINABILITY JOURNEYS\nAccording to Prof Ang, SUSS’ MOU with RSM is laser-focused on three crucial aspects – the creation of a training curriculum, sustainability research and engagement in consultancy projects. These areas have been identified as gaps that SMEs often encounter when striving to weave sustainability into their operations.\n“The training programmes help to address the sustainability knowledge gaps that SMEs have, while the consultancy projects are designed to bridge the gap in practical expertise in implementing sustainability practices,” explained Prof Ang. “Our research endeavours aim to meet the need for sustainability best practices, such as easily adoptable sustainability standards of practice for scaling up within an organisation.”\nTo mitigate the issue of limited resources and expertise, SUSS is offering affordable consultancy services to SMEs looking for guidance in their sustainability journeys. Working alongside industry experts, including its partner RSM, CESG will provide consultancy sessions, toolkits and other tailored resources to help kickstart the process for SMEs.\n“To keep costs affordable, we will also tap on skills-based volunteers who have deep sustainability knowledge and the passion to support SMEs through the consultancy process,” revealed Prof Ang. “We intend to roll out this consultancy initiative as a pilot programme next year.”\nTo help close the knowledge gap, SUSS will work with Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs) and other industry partners to carry out joint research, organise regular sustainability forums, facilitate Community of Practice sharing sessions for participants in the SME consultancy programme, and create templates and guidelines for sustainability initiatives.\nRecognising the unique sustainability needs inherent to different sectors, SUSS plans to seek insights and feedback from TACs to ensure that the training programmes developed under the MOU offer a tailored fit for SMEs across various industries. The programmes will be scalable, stackable and flexible, allowing SME staff to acquire the skillsets essential for their career development – and to help their companies go greener, faster.\nEDUCATING A NEW COHORT OF SUSTAINABILITY LEADERS\nEnsuring that Singapore has a pipeline of sustainability-savvy talent is top of mind for Dr Tan Eng Joo, head of Graduate Programmes in Sustainability Management and the co-chair of SUSS’ sustainability committee.\nDr Tan oversees the Graduate Certificate in Sustainability Management and the Graduate Diploma in Sustainability Management. Together with the Master of Management with a specialisation in Sustainability Management, these programmes are currently accepting applications for classes scheduled to begin in January next year.\nThe Master of Social Entrepreneurship – which will be launched later in 2024 – also includes a sustainability track, aimed at developing a focused understanding on best practices for Singapore’s environmental, social and governance (ESG) ecosystem and global ESG standards.\nAccording to Dr Tan, postgraduates are the target demographic for SUSS’ sustainability management programmes as they can leverage their professional expertise and networks to put their newly acquired knowledge to good use.\nSaid Dr Tan: “Postgraduate students tend to better appreciate the complexity of sustainability challenges and the need for coordinated, interdisciplinary solutions. Their professional connections make them well-suited to implement such solutions, in addition to being advocates and change agents. Also, those who are further along in their careers are better positioned to lead, drive and support the transformational change that is often needed to create positive impact.”\nDeveloped in collaboration with industry partners to guarantee the curriculum’s direct applicability in the workplace, the sustainability management programmes at SUSS are aimed at young professionals seeking to build careers in the sustainability sector, mid-to-senior managers entrusted with ESG-related responsibilities, and individuals possessing technical expertise – such as in energy efficiency or photovoltaic systems – who are transitioning into managerial roles.\n“Even professionals in roles related to environmental stewardship and those facilitating the broader sustainability ecosystem, such as consultants, can benefit from our programmes,” highlighted Dr Tan.\nFurthermore, SUSS has forged strategic alliances with RSM and the Building and Construction Authority to jointly shape and deliver selected courses. Said Dr Tan: “We regularly scan the sustainability landscape to ensure the continued relevance of our programmes. For instance, the issuance of the IFRS S1 and S2 by the International Sustainability Standards Board represents a noteworthy development that will be integrated into our Sustainability Reporting course.”\nIn an effort to give learners the flexibility to tailor their educational journey according to their professional demands, schedules and personal commitments, these programmes are designed to be stackable, allowing for customisation through elective courses that zoom in on specific sectors and job functions. These specialised areas can include the built environment and procurement.\nSaid Dr Tan: “The urgency of climate change demands that professionals at every career stage swiftly acquire the skills and knowledge required to mitigate climate risk and propel the shift towards a sustainable future.”\nVisit suss.edu.sg to learn more about sustainability-related qualifications and initiatives."

            "Article Body": "The COVID-19 pandemic hit these job-seekers hard, but upskilling at NTUC LearningHub helped them to forge new career paths.\nOnce the owner of a thriving salad bar, Ms Lilik Mariyatin found herself at a loss when the pandemic forced the shuttering of her seven-year-old business in mid-2020.\n“I was worried about maintaining financial stability, especially as I was supporting my teenage son’s education,” she said. “I was also concerned about the welfare of my staff and their families.”\nThe weight of these anxieties bore down heavily on Ms Lilik. To fill her time constructively, she turned her attention to volunteering, actively participating in the distribution of food to low-income families affected by the pandemic.\nIn time, her stint as a volunteer inspired her to strike out in a new career. Ms Lilik, who is in her early 40s and had no experience in the healthcare sector, resolved to embark on a new professional journey – one where her contributions could tangibly improve the lives of others.\nA friend introduced her to the SkillsFuture Career Transition Programme Healthcare Assistant course at NTUC LearningHub, previously known as the SGUnited Skills Healthcare Assistant course.\nAt NTUC LearningHub, a continuing education and training provider that focuses on outcome-based training and the development of job-ready skills, Ms Lilik discovered newfound enthusiasm for learning and embraced a growth mindset to facilitate her career transition. Additionally, she appreciated the trainer’s ability to impart invaluable industry insights while infusing lessons with a touch of humour. “Meeting fellow course mates from diverse backgrounds made me realise I wasn’t the only one making a career switch, and this made things less daunting,” she shared.\nUpon completing the course in late 2022, Ms Lilik secured a position as a healthcare assistant in a hospital, where her responsibilities include managing patients’ nutrition and fluid requirements, mobility assistance and patient communication. Her mastery of these competencies is a testament to the skills-based training provided by NTUC LearningHub.\nSaid Ms Lilik: “The course curriculum is both comprehensive and tailored to industry demands, offering a high-quality learning experience. I’ve not only gained a fresh set of skills but have also transitioned into a new career path that offers financial stability and, above all, the opportunity to make a positive impact on the lives of others.”\nLike Ms Lilik, Mr Calvin Tan and Mr Vikaraman Rajaratanam grappled with their own pandemic-induced career crossroads. Fuelled by a determination to adapt to the shifting employment landscape, both gentlemen turned to NTUC LearningHub for reskilling and upskilling opportunities. Equipped with newly acquired capabilities, they successfully secured positions in their respective fields.\nREFRESHING HIS PROJECT MANAGEMENT SKILL SET\nSince 2017, Mr Tan, 38, had been running a board game shop that welcomed families and friends for leisurely play and camaraderie.\nPlaytime ended, however, when the COVID-19 pandemic struck in 2020. Mr Tan shifted his business online, but he also knew he had to develop a plan for the long term. Contemplating the uncertain timeline of the pandemic, Mr Tan thought: “What if the pandemic persists for a year, or even two?” Driven by these concerns, he decided to return to the corporate world.\nFormerly a project management professional, Mr Tan charted a return to the field. Knowing that he had to update his skill set to compete in the present-day job market, he enrolled for courses in Agile and project management at NTUC LearningHub. \n“Tech is an ever-evolving sector. What you learnt today can become obsolete tomorrow,” he explained. “This is something I tell my friends – that I must know ‘what is happening tomorrow, yesterday’. That’s why my motto is to never stop learning.”\nArmed with his newfound proficiencies, Mr Tan secured a role as an assistant project manager in the IT software development sector in 2021. Today, as a project manager, he attributes his success in the field to the courses he undertook at NTUC LearningHub, which enhanced his value as an employee.\nThe knowledge he acquired remains acutely relevant to his current work: “I am engaged in various projects that span the gamut from Waterfall to Agile methodologies. Not all companies in Singapore have embraced the Agile approach, and hence, I need to enlighten my clients on its benefits, such as how Agile methodology enables iterative adjustments, resulting in outcomes that align more closely with their expectations.”\nDuring his time at NTUC LearningHub, he had the opportunity to interact with peers from tech and non-tech backgrounds. “I was particularly inspired by a fellow course mate who was a senior in his late 50s,” he recalled. “He exemplified what it means to never stop learning.”\nTaking this motto on board, Mr Tan chose to continue upskilling even beyond the pandemic. Last December, he signed up for NTUC LearningHub’s Project Management Institute (PMI)-Agile Certified Practitioner course: “PMI is the gold standard in project management and possessing this credential will propel me even further in my career.”\nBECOMING MORE AGILE IN TECH\nAfter graduating with a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering and a master’s degree in management, Mr Vikaraman, 33, embarked on his career as a project engineer in the construction industry. However, harbouring a longstanding passion for technology, he soon decided to set his course in that direction.\nHe joined a local IT start-up but was retrenched in July 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Undaunted, Mr Vikaraman knew that he had to upskill to remain employable.\nHe turned to NTUC LearningHub, completing most of the Certified Scrum Master, Certified Scrum Product Owner and ICAgile courses, in addition to courses in cloud engineering.\n“I had a keen interest in Agile and Scrum methodologies. The Agile courses from NTUC LearningHub appealed to me as they were funded by the Institute of Banking and Finance, and NTUC LearningHub has a good track record for delivering quality courses.”\nBesides the engaging course curriculum, Mr Vikaraman enjoyed networking with and learning from his course mates. “The insights shared by trainers, who are industry practitioners themselves, also broadened my perspectives,” he added.\nToday, as an innovation executive at a homegrown supply chain solutions firm with an expansive Asian network, Mr Vikaraman said that his new skills enable him to contribute to the digital transformation of his workplace.\n“These skills have helped me in my job, where I am involved in exploring technologies and innovations such as artificial intelligence, 5G, Internet of Things, robotics and automation,” he said. “The Agile mindset has empowered me to generate ideas that are out of the box.”\nMr Vikaraman, who plans to specialise in areas such as cybersecurity and move into a consulting role, reflected that lifelong learning is as much about changing oneself as it is about changing careers. He said: “It is important to be open and to have a growth mindset where you are always seeking opportunities to upskill and pivot into emerging industries.”\nThinking of a career switch?

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "Thanks to the efforts of its operations and customer service teams, the e-commerce giant has established an industry-leading standard to better protect consumer rights.\nMs Evelyn Goh, a 48-year-old manager at a pharmaceutical consulting company, often purchases pet supplies online for her dog. \nShe recalled receiving the wrong item on an order from Shopee previously, which led her to initiate a return request and seek a refund. She expected the process to be a complicated one, but to her relief, found it to be hassle-free. \n“I just needed to open the app, press a few buttons, submit some information and the application was completed,” said Ms Goh. Within a day, the issue was resolved. \nThis seamless process is part of Shopee’s commitment to enhancing consumer protection and dispute resolution measures, enabling consumers to shop with peace of mind. This includes equipping its operations and customer service teams with the skills to manage challenges that arise, such as delivery issues and unsatisfactory customer experiences.\nGOLD STANDARD FOR PROCESSING RETURNS AND REFUNDS \nTo foster a worry-free shopping experience and improve customer satisfaction, Shopee aims to maintain an average resolution time of 2.5 working days for processing returns and refunds – surpassing the industry norm of seven days that is recommended by the Consumers Association of Singapore. \nMr Esten Mok, head of operations at Shopee, said: “It is impossible to have 100 per cent problem-free online transactions. Instead, it is crucial for e-commerce platforms to have in place a robust dispute management framework to ensure fair and prompt resolution of conflicts between buyers and sellers.”\nTo bolster its customer service capabilities, Shopee has enhanced its app to facilitate direct communication between customers and customer service agents who specialise in handling return and refund requests. In addition, it has established a framework for evaluating the validity of such requests, leading to improvements in the fairness and efficiency of dispute resolution procedures.\nA CONCERTED EFFORT\nThe seamless coordination among Shopee’s customer service teams plays a pivotal role in efficiently addressing customer requests for returns and refunds. \nMs Nana Chong, returns and refunds manager at Shopee, said: “Our teams are available online seven days a week, from 8am to 10pm, to ensure that customer requests are handled promptly.”\nShopee requires both the buyer and seller to provide evidence, such as photos or videos, so that its customer service teams can evaluate the quality of disputed products and ensure fair and consistent judgements based on Shopee’s arbitration framework. \nCommon reasons for return and refund requests include issues involving incomplete, defective or damaged items, incorrect deliveries or counterfeit products. Ms Chong noted that, on occasion, the teams encounter tricky cases where seeking the expert opinion of a third party becomes necessary. \nShe cited: “Once, a customer requested a return because he suspected that he had received a counterfeit product. Despite the seller providing a certificate of authenticity, we still sent the item, which was quite valuable, to experts for verification. The results confirmed the authenticity of the item.”\nAnother challenging aspect involves mediating cases related to perishable food items. “Sometimes, food may spoil due to customers leaving the package outside for an extended period. In such cases, our agents will gather evidence from the seller to show that they have delivered the goods in consumable condition, or that the buyer had provided approval to the delivery worker to leave the order at the doorstep but did not arrive home in time to collect it before it went bad,” Ms Chong explained. \nAssisting with such investigations is all in a day’s work for Ms Invioni Theniu, a senior operations associate with Shopee’s customer service team. She manages complex cases that require additional support and are prioritised for further investigation. \nAt times, Ms Theniu inadvertently becomes the target of customers’ frustration. However, she tries to empathise with affected customers, and listens patiently to their problems and requests. “The most important thing is to help customers resolve their issues as quickly as possible. I welcome any feedback to further improve our processes,” she said. \nMs Theniu recalled an incident involving a customer who encountered difficulties registering a new address and making payment. After understanding the customer’s situation, she worked with the technical team to resolve the customer’s problem. The customer later expressed her gratitude to Ms Theniu through a heartfelt appreciation email.\nSuch affirmation motivates Ms Theniu and her team to strive towards constantly improving the shopping experience for customers.\nHELPING YOU SHOP CONFIDENTLY\nTo build trust among its users, Shopee maintains stringent measures to ensure the authenticity of sellers on its platform.\nAccording to Mr Jonathan Kok, who leads Seller Operations at Shopee, prospective sellers must undergo a real-name authentication process or provide company registration documents, and pass Shopee’s verification procedure. “Sellers must also comply with the platform’s rules and terms. Swift action is taken in the event of any violation,” he said. \nShopee uses a penalty points system to regulate seller conduct. Sellers who accumulate penalty points for platform violations may face restrictions – such as an exclusion from marketing campaigns – in their operations on Shopee. \nThe platform also implements other consumer protection initiatives, such as Shopee Mall, which guarantees product authenticity and free returns; Shopee Preferred Sellers, a recognition of sellers who have high shop reviews and excellent service; as well as Shopee Guarantee, a secure payment feature that releases payment to sellers only after buyers have confirmed the receipt of items in good condition and expressed satisfaction with their purchases.\nShopee also provides a range of training resources to help sellers improve their performance. “Sellers can log in to the Seller Education Hub to learn how to better operate on Shopee. They can also join the online seller community to exchange ideas with peers and learn tips to enhance their operations,” said Mr Kok. \nIndeed, creating a smoother online shopping experience necessitates collaboration among buyers, sellers and the e-commerce platform itself. \nSaid Mr Mok: “With strong coordination among Shopee’s customer service teams and a robust dispute management framework, we strive to resolve online shopping disputes promptly. In this way, we improve the efficiency of transactions, strengthen buyers’ confidence in using Shopee, and optimise time and resource utilisation for our sellers. By actively implementing consumer protection initiatives, we create a reliable and satisfying user experience for both buyers and sellers on Shopee.”\nEnjoy a worry-free online shopping experience with Shopee.

            "Article Body": "Prepare for spine-chilling spectacles and legendary monsters this Halloween season.\nWhether it’s the nightmarish visage of Freddie Krueger that invades your dreams or the eerie laughter of the pontianak that sends chills down your spine, the realm of the supernatural has long captivated the human imagination, inciting both terror and exhilaration. \nThis September, gear up for an amplified dose of both as Sunway Lagoon unveils an array of bone-tingling attractions for the ninth edition of its annual Halloween extravaganza Nights of Fright. \nSaid Mr Calvin Ho, executive director of Sunway Theme Parks: “For an electrifying experience that caters to thrill-seekers, our passionate production team has gone the extra mile to create four brand-new haunted houses inspired by terrors from the East and West for Nights of Fright 9 (NOF9).”\nRUN, AND DON’T LOOK BACK\nHave you ever watched a horror movie and thought you could outsmart the villain? Here’s your chance to pit your wits against a nefarious barber with a secret.\nAt The Legend of Sweeney Todd: Barbershop Killer of Fleet Street, you’ll journey back to the Victorian era and confront the notorious razor-wielding fiend. As you flee from his clutches, think twice about accepting the meat pies baked by his devilish partner Mrs Lovett. \nOnce you’ve successfully navigated the labyrinthine walls of this attraction, head to the back of the park for even more terrifying thrills at Texas Chainsaw Massacre - Out.Back.Attack! Here, wandering visitors will chance upon Leatherface’s secret sheds, where it won’t take long to register that the scattered pieces of skin don’t come from animals. Get ready to run for your life when the maniac announces his appearance with the deafening roar of his iconic chainsaw. \nENCOUNTERS OF THE UNDEAD KIND \nIf you manage to escape from the serial killers, don’t celebrate just yet. With two show stages and a haunted theatre, NOF9 promises even more nightmarish encounters.\nExpect to be caught in the middle of a botched ritual led by a malevolent witch queen or to cross paths with a vengeful Little Red Riding Hood. \nPerhaps the most harrowing experience would be finding yourself in the midst of two zombie hordes. As you flee from the ravenous undead, reminiscent of those from The Walking Dead, be on the lookout for the robed Asian zombies. Don’t let their stiff gait fool you, as they will pounce when you least expect it.\nTERRIFYING TALES FROM ASIA\nThe power of cultural familiarity is the reason for NOF9’s heavy emphasis on presenting terrors close to home. Grab a bite at Madame Zhu’s Noodle House, designed to resemble the restaurants of Hong Kong. If you’re finding the quiet atmosphere unsettling, there’s a reason: Beware of the unhinged chef who’s bent on serving up his sinister menu.\nOver at Animalium, you’ll explore a toxic wasteland where survivors have mutated into were-creatures resembling the animals of the Chinese zodiac.\nThe scares at NOF9 are not limited to designated areas; the entire park has been transformed into a canvas for horror. “Our Fields of Fear are designed to plunge every guest into a nightmarish realm,” said Mr Ho. “Be warned: A pocong (shrouded corpse) or a pontianak could be lurking around the corner.”\n \nTest your mettle at Sunway Lagoon’s Nights of Fright 9, happening from Sep 29 till Oct 31, every Friday to Sunday from 7.30pm to 11.30pm. \nAdmission tickets start from RM128 (S$37.25), with the option to add an Xpress Pass to skip queues at selected rides and attractions for RM98.

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "Going grey may be a natural part of ageing, but certain lifestyle habits may be exacerbating the problem, says a Bioskin expert. \nGrey hair, often associated with maturity, wisdom and experience, has found its way into the hearts of Hollywood celebrities like Ryan Reynolds, Mark Ruffalo and Andie MacDowell, who proudly sport the salt-and-pepper look.\nFor many of us, however, those silver strands can be seen as unwelcome reminders of the passage of time. While frequent chemical hair dyeing may provide a temporary fix, it fails to address the underlying cause of the problem. Is there anything one can do to slow down the process? \nAccording to Ms Doris Tan, assistant general manager at Bioskin, the transformation to grey hair can be explained by the science behind it. Our hair gets its colour from a pigment known as melanin. As we age, our hair follicles gradually produce less melanin due to a decrease in melanocytes, the cells responsible for its production. Consequently, during the natural process of hair regeneration, new strands are more likely to emerge in shades of grey. \nBeyond appearances, Ms Tan pointed out that greying hair is linked to hair health. “Grey hair is a sign that your tresses are no longer healthy – these strands tend to have a shorter lifespan, are more prone to breakage and are harder to manage,” she said.\nTHE LIFESTYLE FACTORS THAT EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM\nThe belief that stress is a contributing factor to premature greying holds more than a sliver of truth, said Ms Tan. Indeed, research showed that stress can accelerate the greying process by affecting the stem cells responsible for regenerating pigment. Underlying medical conditions may also be responsible for greying strands.\nBesides these, Ms Tan highlighted that smoking, excessive alcohol consumption and frequent late nights can lead to premature greying. “Poor nutrition and a deficiency in Vitamin B12, a nutrient that aids in melanin production, may also play a role,” she added.\nNeglecting hair hygiene is another factor. “Some people avoid washing their hair every day as they are worried about hair loss,” Ms Tan said. “But in Singapore’s hot and humid climate, not making this a daily habit can result in clogged hair follicles and affect hair health.”\nFrequent chemical treatments, including dyeing, bleaching and re-bonding, can also further damage hair roots. “The problem is exacerbated when people start colouring their hair regularly the moment they spot a few grey hairs,” she said. \nMITIGATING THE PROBLEM OF GREY HAIR\nPractising good hair hygiene, reducing stress levels and avoiding harsh chemical treatments are some of the measures you can implement to combat premature greying, said Ms Tan. For individuals whose greying is primarily due to lifestyle factors rather than medical conditions, there are professional treatments one can consider as well.\nBioskin’s Grey Hair Reverse Treatment is a chemical-free hair pigmentation treatment that targets the underlying causes of scalp and hair ageing by nourishing the roots and providing essential nutrients to stimulate pigment production in melanocytes.\n“Bioskin’s advanced treatment is specially formulated to both cover and reverse grey hair. The treatment boosts the metabolism of the hair roots, promoting the regrowth of healthier and darker strands,” Ms Tan said. \nThe treatment harnesses the power of natural herbs and botanical ingredients. These include green tea protein, an antioxidant said to improve the function of hair follicles; amla, which is rich in Vitamin C and has anti-ageing properties; cellulose to help retain moisture and enhance shine; as well as silk protein that nourishes the hair shaft and acts as a protective barrier against UV rays. Together, these ingredients promote hair growth, increase hair strength and improve the scalp’s health.\nAnother key ingredient in the treatment is cold-pressed black seed oil from Sri Lanka, which has antibacterial and antifungal properties and contains a high concentration of the antioxidant thymoquinone to protect the scalp from free radical damage. “Black seed oil stimulates pigment production and prevents the premature ageing of melanocytes. It also has Omega-3 and Omega-6 to stimulate blood circulation,” Ms Tan explained. \nShe added that the treatment is safe and non-invasive, with long-lasting results. Over time, customers can expect healthier hair with a semi-permanent reddish-brown hue. Ms Tan shared that most customers can see noticeable results after receiving the treatment bi-weekly for three to six months. “As the treatment progresses, the colour intensifies, which means individuals may no longer need frequent dye jobs to mask their grey hair,” she said. \nIf you’re tired of constantly resorting to hair colouring to conceal grey strands, consider making improvements to your lifestyle and taking advantage of professional hair pigmentation treatments that may help reduce the need for frequent salon visits. \nNew customers can try Bioskin’s Grey Hair Reverse Treatment at a special price of S$48* (before GST), which is inclusive of a relaxing shoulder massage. Find out more about the treatment and book your appointment. Terms and conditions apply.\nIndividual results may vary."

            "Article Body": "VitaHealth’s VLife series contains essential nutrients aimed at boosting energy levels and immunity, and reducing stress levels. \nMaintaining a balanced diet, regular exercise and sufficient sleep are habits that are vital to our health and well-being, particularly with the demands of our fast-paced lives.\nFor busy folks who struggle to find the time to eat well, a ready-to-drink dietary supplement could offer a convenient nutrition boost. \nThe newly launched VLife series by VitaHealth, a health supplement brand with more than 76 years of experience in nutritional health, aims to do just that. Suitable for individuals aged 18 and above, the series comprises three formulations – B-Calm, Imunee and Powerr – all packaged in liquid sachets.  \nSaid Ms Beh Kheng Suan, VitaHealth’s country head in Malaysia and Singapore: “Maintaining a healthy lifestyle can be challenging, especially when you’re constantly on the go. The VLife series is designed for busy individuals seeking a quick and easy way to nourish their body and support overall health and wellness.”\nA DOSE OF CALMNESS\nAccording to a study conducted by the Institute of Policy Studies, young adults in their 20s and middle-aged individuals in their 40s have experienced a decline in mental health over the course of the pandemic. Even as life gradually returns to a state of normalcy, persistent stressors such as the rising costs of living and ongoing uncertainty about the future continue to contribute to feelings of anxiety and distress.\nThe adverse effects of prolonged stress on our health and well-being are widely acknowledged. VLife B-Calm is a wellness product that is designed to help relax one’s physiological and emotional state, with targeted benefits that include alleviating anxiety, enhancing focus, stabilising mood swings and reducing stress levels. \n“Formulated using a patented banana peel extract, VLife B-Calm aims to support serotonin levels in the brain,” said Ms Beh. Serotonin, often dubbed the “happy hormone”, plays a key role in boosting mood, managing stress and improving sleep quality. \nVLife B-Calm also contains L-theanine (green tea extract), chamomile extract and gamma-aminobutyric acid (bran ferment). \nL-theanine, an amino acid found in green tea, may relieve anxiety and improve mood, attention and memory, according to a study published in the Journal of Medicinal Food. Meanwhile, chamomile, which is rich in the antioxidant apigenin, is recognised for its sedative properties, suggests a study published in the Journal of Education and Health Promotion. Gamma-aminobutyric acid has also been found to enhance sleep quality, as seen in research published in the Journal of Clinical Neurology.  \nThose with pre-existing liver conditions may wish to consult their doctors before taking B-Calm due to the green tea extract in its formula.\nSUPPORTING YOUR IMMUNITY\nTo boost the body’s natural defence and respiratory functions, Ms Beh recommends VLife Imunee, which contains elderberry ferment extract, Japanese honeysuckle (jin yin hua) as well as extracts of sea buckthorn (sha ji) and monk fruit (luo han guo). \nAccording to a study in the journal Food Chemistry: X, elderberries contain beneficial compounds such as polyphenols and anthocyanin that are known for their antioxidant properties. The patented elderberry ferment extract in Imunee contains these compounds and helps activate a healthy immune response by increasing cytokine production. Cytokines are proteins that aid in controlling inflammation in the body. \nIn traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), ingredients such as Japanese honeysuckle, sea buckthorn and monk fruit are often used to support healthy upper respiratory functions, said Ms Beh. She added: “Sea buckthorn is a common remedy in TCM to relieve phlegm and coughs, while monk fruit is traditionally used to nourish the lungs and throat.”\nA NATURAL ENERGY BOOST\nWhether you’re a student, working professional or busy parent, having sufficient energy to tackle daily tasks is crucial. VLife Powerr is designed to alleviate fatigue and promote sustained energy, leaving you mentally and physically rejuvenated.  \nIt incorporates a patented ginseng cordyceps complex ferment, along with four other stamina-boosting ingredients: Taurine to increase physical endurance, damiana leaf extract to improve blood circulation as well as Vitamin B complex and zinc to support metabolism. \n“VitaHealth’s patented ginseng cordyceps complex is produced using a three-stage fermentation process that increases its saponin content (one of the active ingredients in ginseng) by more than 600 per cent,” shared Ms Beh. \nGinseng has long been associated with numerous health benefits, including improved memory function and blood circulation. Studies also suggest that it can help ease fatigue and increase energy levels. \nYOUR WELLNESS COMPANION \nThe VLife series is conveniently available in a liquid sachet format, allowing for easy consumption at any time and place. Users may take it once or twice daily after meals.\nWhile capsule and tablet supplements remain the go-to among consumers, liquid supplements in ready-to-drink formats have become increasingly popular since the onset of the pandemic, according to market research from Euromonitor International. Ms Beh highlighted that the individual packaging of the VLife series not only offers convenience but also improves hygiene.\nShe added that the VLife series uses a patented DoubleNutri liposomal technology that allows for better nutrient absorption, particularly for those with a sensitive digestive system. This micro-emulsification technology combines water- and oil-soluble nutrients with natural plant extracts and functional ingredients to form ultra-fine particles. This increases the bioavailability – the extent in which a substance can be absorbed and used by the body – by more than two times, according to Ms Beh.\n“In essence, this technology helps to enhance nutrient absorption, so that our body is able to function optimally”, she explained.\nPower through life’s demands with VitaHealth’s VLife series, available at selected Watsons and VitaHealth online flagship stores.

            "Article Body": "Acquiring in-demand tech skills at NTUC LearningHub gave three go-getters the confidence and competency to take on new challenges.\nWith the nature of work and job roles constantly evolving with digital transformation, it is becoming more crucial than ever for jobseekers to possess an arsenal of skill sets that distinguishes them from other candidates. \nMs Mariska Tan, who is in her 40s, was well aware of this when she interviewed for a procurement and sustainability specialist role at an event management company.\nFinding herself at a career crossroads, she gamely picked up new skills from the Community and Partnerships Specialist course at NTUC LearningHub, a continuing education and training centre for the infocomm technology (ICT) sector appointed by SkillsFuture Singapore. Designed to help people upskill or reskill to take on jobs with better prospects, the centre offers a range of courses focused on ICT skills in the areas of data analytics, software development, Agile and project management, cloud and infocomm technology infrastructure, and cybersecurity across all competency levels.\nMs Tan also sent a handwritten card to her interviewers to thank them for their time – a tip she picked up from the Career Resilience Executive Workshop by NTUC’s e2i (Employment and Employability Institute). The sincere gesture, which demonstrated her soft skills in addition to her technical skills, helped her to secure the job.\nAlong with fellow jobseekers Matlapudi Lakshmi Tulasi and Stanley Lee who also honed their digital skill sets at NTUC LearningHub, Ms Tan was able to embark on a new career.\nSAME ROLE, BUT NEW SKILLS FOR A NEW INDUSTRY\nPrior to joining her current company, Ms Tan spent over a decade as a procurement specialist at a chemical and mining services company. Uncertainty over job security (there were rumours of her team being outsourced), coupled with her need for down time after caring for critically ill family members, led Ms Tan to resign in December 2021.\nInitially, Ms Tan was eyeing the Digital Marketing Specialist course at NTUC LearningHub, but the timing did not suit her schedule. That turned out to be a blessing in disguise as her second choice, the six-month Community and Partnerships Specialist course, covered digital marketing, the fundamentals of event management and the Privacy Data Protection Act (PDPA) – all of which have come in handy in her present role.\n“Though I do not plan or organise events myself, I gained an understanding of what is involved in organising an event, which is useful when procuring goods and services for an events management company,” she said. “I also learnt how digital marketing can help with performance and reaching a wider audience, while the PDPA course taught me about data governance and protection, which is crucial as I evaluate vendors’ security and sustainability risks.”\nHer advice to others who are looking to upskill in new areas? “It’s never too late to learn something new, especially skills that are transferable across job roles,” she said. “You just have to put your heart into it and stay positive.”\nFROM STAY-AT-HOME MUM TO SOFTWARE ENGINEER\nAfter delivering her son in 2007, Ms Tulasi decided to put her career on hold to recover her health and care for her child. Now 42, she made the momentous decision to restart her career in 2018.\nOn the advice of Workforce Singapore, she enrolled in NTUC LearningHub’s Java Developer course in 2020 to include an accredited certification in programming to her portfolio. The course equipped her with knowledge on Oracle and Spring Boot development frameworks, and honed her analytical and problem-solving skills.\nMs Tulasi chose the course as it built on the learning she pursued during her hiatus from the workforce. She had taken a web development course and engaged in her own self-learning to ensure that she was better prepared to re-enter the tech industry at the appropriate juncture.\nIn addition to the technical skills she picked up from the Java Developer course, she acquired critical core skills (soft skills) such as teamwork, time management and communication, which have proved useful in her current role as a software engineer in testing and production support. She secured the role in 2021 after completing the course and excelling at an internship at the same company that year.\n“The skills that I gained helped me land the job. I’m now working on the Java application and I help users fix issues they may face at work,” said Ms Tulasi. “I am able to tap on my technical, problem-solving and analytical skills to resolve their issues. My communication skills allow me to better understand from clients what the issues are, gather the requirements and meet their needs in a timely manner.”\nMs Tulasi, who is looking forward to learning about different software applications, said that it is important to keep pace with change by being technologically savvy. Noting that the past decade has seen the rise of new technologies and new ways of working, she added: “To remain competitive, we must keep finding opportunities to upgrade ourselves. The course has given me an awareness of these changes in the industry and helped me to adapt to them.” \nAFTER RETRENCHMENT, A NEW PHASE\nMr Lee was a systems engineering manager for a start-up when he was retrenched in March 2020.\nMethodical by nature, Mr Lee immediately examined his finances to ensure he had enough set aside for his daughter’s university education. He then updated his resume and kept a spreadsheet of all the hundreds of job applications he sent out. But it was the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, and many organisations were cautious about hiring.\nThree to four months of unemployment went by. Unfazed, Mr Lee decided to sign up for the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Robotics course at NTUC LearningHub, fuelled by a childhood passion for robotics and programming. While he left midway through the nine-month-long course after securing a job as a principal engineer for a local infosecurity organisation in late 2020, he said that the programming and decision tree modules from the course are still relevant and applicable in his current role in cybersecurity.\nHe also found the course instructors – who all had vast industry experience – patient and knowledgeable, while his course mates made learning fun, engaging and mutually beneficial: “We were able to share our experience and industrial know-how with our trainers and fellow course mates, and we helped one another in solving key issues related to programming and building robotics models.”\nNow a senior systems engineer for a data protection and data platform company, Mr Lee said that the AI and robotics course gave him a much-needed confidence boost, reassuring him it was still possible to learn even in his 50s.\n“The course certainly heeded the Government’s call to refresh, upskill, learn new skills and be a lifelong learner,” he reflected. “It expanded my knowledge and skill set, refreshing and enhancing my competencies.”\n“Some roles may utilise your newly acquired skills, while other skills learnt may have indirect applications, too,” he added. “As long as you have the commitment and determination, you can demonstrate and apply your new knowledge and skills.”\nTake the first step in upskilling yourself at NTUC LearningHub."

            "Article Body": "Being able to handle stress well, whether in school or at work, starts with having the right nutrition. Here’s how the new Meiji Multivitamin Milk can help supplement your diet.\nWhen it comes to eating well, most of us start out with the best intentions. We find nutritious recipes, pick up colourful produce at the supermarket, and set aside time to prepare healthy meals for ourselves and our children.\nHowever, when the pressures of work and school kick in, it’s all too easy to let good eating habits fall by the wayside in favour of heavily processed, ready-to-eat food.\nEver craved bubble tea or reached for potato chips when you’re studying for an important exam or rushing to meet a deadline? Eating junk food – usually food that's high in fat and sugar – causes our brain to release dopamine, a neurotransmitter that makes us feel good, providing temporary release from stress. \nOver the long term, consuming too much fatty or sugary foods can increase inflammation in the body, exacerbating stress and anxiety while putting you at risk of chronic illnesses like diabetes.\nA healthy diet – one that includes complex carbohydrates, protein, healthy fats, and a variety of vitamins and minerals – is an important part of stress management as it helps regulate hormones like cortisol and adrenaline.\nThe good news: Eating healthy doesn’t have to be time-consuming or daunting. With some small tweaks and by making informed choices, it’s possible to fit good nutrition into your busy schedule. \nWHY IS MILK GOOD FOR US?\nDrinking milk, long touted as being beneficial for our health, is an easy way to get a variety of nutrients into your diet. \nMilk is good for us as it’s a complete protein, according to a report by accredited nutritionist and presenter-host Charlotte Mei de Drouas, who runs nutrition literacy workshops and talks. “In addition to casein and whey, milk contains all nine essential amino acids that cannot be synthesised by the body, and therefore have to be obtained through one’s diet,” said Ms de Drouas.\nMilk also supplies one with energy, along with micronutrients in an easily absorbed form, she added. Micronutrients are vitamins and minerals that are vital for our bodies to function well, and while they are needed only in small quantities, any deficiency may lead to health issues. \nPLUGGING NUTRITION GAPS WITH ENRICHED MILK\nA study published in Public Health Nutrition in 2017 found that fortified milk reduced the risk of anaemia in young children, although more evidence is needed before global recommendations can be made, clarified Ms de Drouas. \nAnother study published in the journal Nutrients in 2017 revealed that students who consumed fortified milk were found to have higher academic performance, motivation and learning compared to those who did not. \n“When consumed alongside a balanced diet of wholegrains, protein, fruit and vegetables, Meiji Multivitamin Milk, which is enriched with 17 multivitamins and minerals, can complement one’s meals and help adults meet their recommended daily allowance for various nutrients,” said Ms de Drouas. \nThose who bemoan their inability to digest dairy have another reason to cheer: Meiji Multivitamin Milk is lactose-free. It is also low in saturated fat and contains no added sugar. \nWHAT MAKES MEIJI MULTIVITAMIN MILK DIFFERENT?\nVitamins found in Meiji Multivitamin Milk can be classified into two categories: Fat- and water-soluble vitamins, said Ms de Drouas. \nMeiji Multivitamin Milk contains Vitamin B-Complex, which includes B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B9 and B12. “These help convert protein, carbohydrates and fat into energy for the body,” she explained, adding that these water-soluble vitamins are essential for growth and development, as well as the optimal functioning of cells.\nVitamin B-Complex is also important for energy production and nervous system function, both of which can be affected by stress. Vitamin B6, in particular, is known to help regulate mood and reduce anxiety.\nVitamins A, D, E and K are some of the fat-soluble vitamins found in Meiji Multivitamin Milk. Vitamin A is essential in maintaining good eye health and a robust immune system. Vitamin D helps with the absorption of calcium required to build and maintain strong and healthy bones, while Vitamin E is an antioxidant that protects cells from damage. Vitamin K is required for blood clotting to help wounds heal. \nMeiji Multivitamin Milk also contains a range of minerals such as calcium, selenium, zinc, iron, sodium and phosphorous, which the body requires to function well, from building healthy bones to regulating hormone production.  \nA WORD ON MIXING MILK AND VITAMINS\nCan there be too much of a good thing? According to Ms de Drouas, there is no evidence to show that mixing vitamins with milk is harmful, or that it compromises how nutrients are absorbed. But if you’re already taking vitamin or mineral supplements, seek the opinion of a health professional. \nWhen life gets hectic, meeting your nutritional requirements is important to help you learn, work and function well. By making smart food choices the next time you stock up on groceries, you can feel good about what you and your family eat even in the busiest of times. \nFind out more about how Meiji Multivitamin Milk can supplement your nutritional needs."

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "Financial independence and early retirement are popular goals for millennials and Gen Z workers – but getting there requires steady financial habits, not risky investments.\nGen Zs and millennials may be the two youngest age groups currently in employment – but according to the OCBC Financial Index 2022, they are the ones who want to retire earlier than everyone else.\nWhile workers aged between 40 and 54, as well as between 55 and 65, preferred to retire at 61 and 65 years of age, respectively, millennials (aged 30 to 39) wanted to stop working at the age of 58, while Gen Z (aged 21 to 29) stated that 57 was their desired retirement age.\nA growing movement among millennials and Gen Z workers is the concept of FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early). This involves achieving financial independence and retiring much earlier than the official retirement age, through a combination of frugal living, aggressive saving and savvy investing. FIRE adherents may aim to retire by their 40s, or even earlier.\nWith employee burnout being the leading factor affecting mental health in Singapore during the pandemic, it’s no surprise that more people are thinking about leaving behind the daily hustle in favour of a slower-paced early retirement.\nOBSTACLES TO CREATING FIRE\nThe desire to retire early has been made more complicated by a range of environmental factors, such as an unbalanced post-pandemic recovery, high interest rates, inflation and market volatility. These have caused Singaporeans’ financial wellness to decline, dipping one point from last year to match 2020’s score of 61 out of a maximum of 100.\nThe index tracks each respondent’s replies to 24 indicators across 10 pillars of financial wellness, including their saving habits and retirement planning.\nThe Index also found that young Singaporeans were still keen on pursuing risky investments, such as cryptocurrencies, despite many experiencing losses in 2022’s crypto crash. This could be due to a lack of investment education or – as suggested by one local pundit – the hope that cryptocurrency investments could make achieving FIRE possible.\nMs Tan Siew Lee, OCBC Bank’s head of wealth management, said that 2022’s market downturn has naturally made young people in Singapore concerned about their finances and their ability to save for retirement.\n“However, engaging in high-risk, speculative behaviour in the hope of making quick gains might cause one’s retirement dream to drift even further out of reach,” she said.\nRISKY BUSINESS\nAccording to the OCBC Financial Wellness Index, two in five crypto investors in their 20s planned to invest more in cryptocurrencies within the next 12 months, despite making average losses of 40 per cent from crypto investments in 2022.\nThis stronger appetite for risk could be due to the younger generations’ own uncertainty regarding whether their goal of early retirement can be reached, as 62 per cent of Gen Zs and 56 per cent of millennials expressed worry that their retirement funds will prove inadequate for their desired lifestyle.\nGen Z was also eyeing a more luxurious retirement, with 34 per cent – the highest proportion compared to other age groups – aiming for a retirement lifestyle that includes private healthcare, full-time domestic help and international holidays twice yearly. In FIRE terms, this is known as Fat FIRE – in which one enjoys an early retirement without having to cut back on life’s luxuries.\nFattening up one’s investment portfolio for Fat FIRE is a challenge, though. Overall, the market downturn in 2022 affected Gen Z the most, with 42 per cent seeing a loss in their investment portfolios, followed by 35 per cent for millennials. These figures were up 19 per cent and 10 per cent respectively, compared to last year.\nCompared to the other age groups, Gen Z also saw the lowest rate of return on their investments at 0.3 per cent. But it’s not all doom: About 48 per cent of Gen Z were deriving side income from part-time endeavours, ranging from food delivery to running online businesses or giving tuition.\nHaving a secondary stream of income can raise one’s monthly earnings substantially. In addition, you can always carry on with your side hustle after quitting your day job – a form of FIRE known as Barista FIRE, where part-time or freelance work supplements income and helps workers keep one foot in the world of employment, should they need to return full-time.\nFINANCING THE FUTURE\nWhile the post-pandemic phase of economic recovery has seen more revenge travel and consumer spending, Singaporeans remained strong savers, with 91 per cent saving at least 10 per cent of their salary.\nLess went to contingency and retirement funds, two categories that saw a slight dip in savings allocation. Only 53 per cent of Singaporeans had the recommended six months’ worth of their current salary in their savings to overcome a crisis.\nSixty-eight per cent of Singaporeans had made a retirement plan – a two per cent increase from 2021. Gen Z workers might need to work on that plan a little more, though: Their preferred retirement lifestyle – with vacations to Europe and the United States, and a high-end car – is likely to cost around S$5,760 a month, instead of most Singaporeans’ estimate of S$3,617.\nAnd with investment portfolios hard hit in 2022 – especially if they held risky assets, like crypto – only 42 per cent of Singaporeans were on track to achieving their retirement goals, compared to 49 per cent in 2021.\nNevertheless, with the right financial habits, Gen Z and millennials can get their FIRE dreams back on track.\nSaid Ms Tan: “When growing one’s retirement funds, it’s best to think long-term, seek professional advice and do research before investing. Young Singaporeans are generally good savers and with prudent financial habits, they can weather this storm – and eventually, achieve their financial goals and ideal retirement.”\nVisit the OCBC Financial Wellness Index to learn more about Singaporeans’ financial wellness, how you compare and what you can do to improve your own financial health."

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "Regulating stress levels and using skin-friendly products can help bring relief to eczema-prone skin, say experts. \nEczema, a chronic condition that causes dry, itchy and inflamed skin, afflicts more individuals than we think. According to local statistics, one in five children and one in 10 adults have eczema.  \nSo, what causes eczema to flare up? Dr Tay Liang Kiat, a dermatologist at Stratum Skin and Surgery, observed that stress is a crucial and common trigger. “The uptick in stress hormones causes increased skin inflammation and reduces the ability of skin to repair itself,” he said. \nHe added that temperature extremes, perspiration and airborne allergens (like dust mites, pollen and pet fur) could exacerbate the condition. \nPractices adopted post COVID-19 could play a part, too. Frequent handwashing and the increased use of hand sanitisers and disinfecting sprays or wipes may contribute to eczema flare-ups. \nEASING THE ITCH \nDr Tay noted that itch is the most debilitating symptom for most eczema patients. “Besides causing poor sleep, intense itch also affects performance at work and in school, reducing one’s quality of life.”\nThere are several medical treatments available for eczema, said Dr Shanna Ng, dermatologist, The Dermatology Practice @ Orchard. Topical steroids and topical non-steroids can help to reduce symptoms like inflammation and swelling while oral antihistamines may alleviate itching. Immunosuppressants and immunomodulating treatments may also be prescribed to inhibit the body’s immune response to allergens like dust or pet fur. \nHowever, relying on oral antihistamines and topical steroids may not suit all eczema patients. “Improper understanding and use of medication may cause side effects in the long run,” said Ms Jianny Tan, a pharmacist in the product development and marketing department at Orendapharma.\nShe cites how improper use of topical steroids may lead to reactions such as skin atrophy, easy bruising, and in serious cases, topical steroid withdrawal resulting in burning, reddened skin and other symptoms. \nMs Tan added that not all eczema-related skin conditions can be treated with antihistamines: “Sedating antihistamines may help to induce sleep, but they don’t stop eczema flares and may not be effective in treating eczema-related itch.” \nAccording to Ms Tan, Orendapharma’s team of researchers gathered in-depth feedback from dermatologists, who surfaced the difficulty of sourcing an effective, convenient and safe product that eczema sufferers could use on a daily basis for itch relief, especially in hard-to-reach areas such as the scalp, back and legs. \n“That’s why we created the AweMed Spray, the first product in the AweMed series, to serve as a temporary reliever for acute itch with its ‘cooling’ effect,” said Ms Tan. \nThe AweMed team managed to stabilise natural menthol, which targets the body’s cooling receptor, in a liquid formulation without alcohol and harsh solvents, thus creating a product that would target itch while being gentle on skin. Ms Tan said the spray format makes it easy and convenient to apply.\nIts cooling formulation is also a boon for eczema patients living in tropical Singapore, where a combination of heat and humidity can adversely affect the skin, she added. \nAs menthol has a strong cooling sensation, Ms Tan recommends first-time users to spray the AweMed Spray onto their palms and use their fingers to dab the product onto affected areas in order to establish their level of comfort, before spraying it on directly.\nA SALVE FOR DAMAGED SKIN\nWith eczema, the skin barrier is damaged, causing the skin to lose moisture and become inflamed, allowing allergens to enter. “Secondary bacterial infection often results in ‘weepy’ eczema skin rashes,” said Dr Tay. \nTo protect and repair the skin barrier, Dr Ng advises that patients increase their moisturiser use as soon as eczema itch sets in. She recommends moisturisers with clean formulations that are free of fragrance, sulphates and parabens. “Moisturising adequately and frequently throughout the day, even when there are no flare-ups, is of utmost importance,” she said. \nAccording to Ms Tan, the AweMed Repair+ Daily Moisturiser is a therapeutic moisturiser that tackles the three main symptoms of eczema – damaged skin, itchy inflammation and bacterial infection risk. \nShe explained that the moisturising formula replenishes both the intercellular and cellular barriers of the skin, reduces inflammation and uses the natural compound zinc pyrrolidone carboxylic acid (PCA) to reduce secondary bacterial infections. \n“AweMed Repair+ is free from harsh ingredients such as steroids, ethanol, fragrances and parabens, so it doesn’t irritate the already weakened skin barrier,” said Ms Tan. “Users are recommended to apply it liberally to their skin two to three times daily or when necessary, to reduce the recurrence of acute or chronic eczema flare-ups.” \nBeyond medical treatment and therapeutic products, Dr Tay underscored the importance of stress management in treating eczema and preventing flare-ups. He said: “Engage in activities that promote relaxation, such as social interactions with family and friends. Eating a healthy balanced diet, getting sufficient rest and sleep as well as exercising regularly could help.”\nFor eczema patients, the right combination of products, lifestyle adjustments and doctor-prescribed treatments could mean sweet relief from the itch. After all, there’s no time like now to lead your best life. Said Dr Ng: “Don’t wait till you’re eczema-free to do the things you love.” \nAweMed Repair+ Daily Moisturiser and the AweMed Spray can be purchased online on the AweMed website, Lazada, Shopee, and at selected hospitals and clinics.

            "Article Body": "As more small businesses take to selling on entertainment platforms like TikTok, logistics provider J&T Express stands ready to deliver.\nWhen it comes to electronic goods, TikTok creator Melissa Wix knows her stuff. As the person behind The Auction House SG, The Heist SG and local start-up Aurion Gadgets, it’s perhaps not surprising that she emerged as the No 1 livestream seller during TikTok Shop’s 12.12 Live Ranking Competition in 2022.\nMs Wix has been selling on the content platform for six years, but even a veteran like her has encountered a hiccup or two. “The most challenging livestream I experienced recently was co-hosting with Wang Lei,” she shared, speaking of her collaboration with the local getai singer who made a new name for himself selling frozen seafood online.\n“We had a language barrier as my Mandarin is poor and his English is shaky. However, this worked out to our advantage because everyone found it funny. We are two opposite livestreamers in terms of age, language, viewers and products, but it worked out great, surprisingly.”\nNo doubt, the spontaneity of livestreaming on TikTok Shop is one of the draws for Ms Wix. “I hope to be doing this for as long as I can,” she said. “I enjoy livestreaming. It doesn’t feel like a job at all.”\nTHE RIGHT TOOLS FOR THE RIGHT NEEDS\n“Shoppertainment” – blending entertainment with online shopping – has proven to be an effective strategy for driving sales online. Consumer engagement is key, and nothing seems to foster engagement better than social media. The move to selling directly on these platforms has been both organic and lucrative – Forbes magazine last year estimated social commerce to be worth US$1.2 trillion (S$1.6 trillion) globally.\nTikTok is one of the latest to harness the power of that wave, with the launch of its retail arm – TikTok Shop – last year. AFTERSHOCK PC, a custom personal computer builder, was quick among Singapore businesses to grab the opportunity. “The best part about selling on TikTok Shop is how it is integrated with the in-feed content, subtly and unassumingly appearing on audiences’ For You page,” said Mr Jonathan Teo, AFTERSHOCK PC’s marketing lead.\nTikTok Shop’s Affiliate Program also enables e-commerce businesses to sell another company’s products and offers support and training to creators.\n“My account manager and creator manager go to great lengths to help me,” said Ms Wix. “Due to my hectic schedule, I once could not make it to a certain location for my livestream. My account manager brought the products to me instead, so we could carry out the livestream without hiccups.”\nAbove all, AFTERSHOCK PC and Ms Wix prize the ability to interact directly with their customers. “We feel more connected to our audiences when we do livestreams,” said Mr Teo. “In the past, we could only address our customers’ concerns when we met them in person. Livestreaming bridges that barrier, allowing us to interact and engage with them virtually ‘in person’.”\nA PARTNER THAT BRINGS IT ALL TOGETHER\nTo drive transactions, TikTok Shop regularly organises campaigns, such as 11.11, 12.12 and the Prosperity Sale for Chinese New Year. “These always bring us outstanding results,” said Mr Teo. “For 11.11, we acquired around 300 new followers just from the livestream.”\nMs Wix agreed: “We’ve broken a few sales records on TikTok Shop Singapore. Our 12.12 livestream hit six digits in a single four-hour stream.”\nWith hectic sales campaign periods, support from trustworthy logistics providers is especially crucial. Ms Wix uses J&T Express, citing its speed and reliability. “J&T Express’ tracking feature is very accurate, and I’m amazed at how fast it can deliver, usually one to three days upon collection,” she said. “During sales campaigns, J&T Express also gave customers vouchers and held giveaways, which made products across TikTok Shop more attractive.”\nJ&T Express is well aware of the logistical challenges TikTok Shop sellers face – such as having lean teams, live selling at odd hours, and packaging orders. Said Mr Peter Cai, J&T Express Singapore’s chief executive officer: “For example, writing details on the airway bills may be easy for a few orders, but what about a thousand orders? In e-commerce, sellers must be prepared to scale with a full-fledged logistics partner.”\nMr Cai added that J&T Express educates and advises sellers so that they can enjoy linear growth without being hindered by logistical problems and focus on building their e-commerce empire. “We see ourselves as the integrated logistics partner of TikTok Shop Singapore and other social media commerce platforms,” he said.\nJoin TikTok Shop’s Treat Yourself Sale Campaign from Feb 25 to 27, 2023, for a seamless shoppertainment experience.

            "Article Body": "The company’s latest survey revealed that shoppers here – both young and old – are turning to the digital platform’s services for their shopping and entertainment needs.\nOnline shopping, in-app gaming and live streaming – these may be digital habits commonly associated with the young and tech-savvy, but on e-commerce platform Shopee, seniors are just as comfortable as their younger counterparts to shop, game and watch livestream content.\n \nAccording to Shopee’s Past the Starting Line: Adapting to Singapore’s Digital Consumers in 2023 report, 70 per cent of seniors aged 55 years and above say they have successfully integrated e-commerce into their lives. \n \nThanks to the platform’s user-friendly interface and interactive features, 84 per cent of senior respondents are buying a larger variety of items online – particularly from the health and wellness, and home appliances categories – as compared to a year before. They’ve also become more adept at collecting and combining vouchers to stack savings.\n \nAs more senior users embrace e-commerce, they’re also looking for other ways to stay entertained online. One in two among them enjoys playing in-app games such as Shopee Candy and Shopee Bubble, which offer discount vouchers as prizes. Now, who says the silver generation isn’t digitally savvy? \n \nKNOWING WHAT USERS WANT\nWith e-commerce being such an integral part of our everyday lives, Shopee embarked on a poll last year to better understand Singapore consumers’ online shopping habits and attitudes.\nOver 1,300 users aged between 15 and 70 were surveyed, and 87 per cent of respondents shared that the convenience of online shopping has made a significant positive impact on their lives. Shoppers today are making more purchases online, with more than 70 per cent of respondents receiving up to five packages from e-commerce platforms per month.\n \nThe survey results also revealed that today’s digital-first consumers are increasingly turning to online platforms that offer end-to-end online shopping experiences that include engagement and entertainment. They are more discerning of quality and are willing to spend time reviewing the authenticity of products and retailers before making a purchase.\n \nBUILDING A COMMUNITY OF TRUST\nIndeed, authenticity and trust are critical when it comes to online purchases. Shopee encourages users to read and leave product and retailer reviews to help others make informed purchasing decisions – an effort that has proven beneficial to shoppers. Three in four survey respondents have found customer reviews on Shopee reliable and believe that they help with their buying decisions.\n \nAdditionally, the e-commerce giant has incorporated a slew of consumer protection measures to allow users to shop more confidently. For example, on Shopee Mall, users can buy the products they love directly from brands or authorised retailers’ official stores, ensuring their authenticity.\nIts Shopee Guarantee safety feature withholds payment to sellers until buyers have received their items in good condition and acknowledged that they are satisfied with their purchases. Shopee was the first among e-commerce platforms in Singapore to launch this safeguard for consumers.\n \nShopee has also streamlined the reporting process at Shopee Help Centre, so that users who have concerns about their products can make a report conveniently. \n \nTo help users learn about the products they’re interested in through a more authentic and intimate setting, Shopee introduced Shopee Live in 2019 – a livestream function that showcases real-time reviews and recommendations.\n \nAccording to Shopee, these live shows – which include a variety of content from food reviews to product demonstrations – have become increasingly popular among viewers aged 34 to 50. More importantly, they have become a credible resource for buyers: Over 60 per cent of survey respondents aged 35 and above say that such real-time reviews and recommendations from hosts during the livestream on Shopee Live are key to influencing their purchase decisions on Shopee.\nBuilding trust with consumers has always been an imperative for Shopee. With over 75 per cent of users in Singapore now choosing to search, compare and eventually buy a product on the platform, it is a testament to how much the brand has connected with users over the years.\nSaid Mr Zhou Junjie, chief commercial officer at Shopee: “As digital consumers continue to shape the future of the digital economy, it is important to be able to identify their evolving needs and preferences while adapting quickly to meet them. We will continue to adopt a user-centric approach using these insights to create a positive experience for all Shopee users.”                 \n                                    \nLearn more about Shopee’s Past the Starting Line: Adapting to Singapore’s Digital Consumers in 2023 report.

            "Article Body": "Jason Marine Group’s partnership with NTUC LearningHub brings both company and employees to the next level.\nAt 60, one might expect Mr Koek Cheng Kwee to slow down at work and look ahead to his retirement years.\nInstead, the training and sales consultancy manager at Jason Marine Group is busy helping to automate processes at his workplace with his newly acquired tech skills, courtesy of a UiPath course he took at NTUC LearningHub, a continuing education and training provider that champions workers’ lifelong employability.\nJason Marine Group, a local small- and medium-size enterprise that specialises in marine communication equipment and services, believes in fostering a learning culture and encouraging employees to take ownership of their career paths. It chose to partner NTUC LearningHub because of the latter’s comprehensive range of learning solutions, ranging from consultancy work to industry-recognised curriculums and customised content development for training courses.\n“We believe in the power of knowledge,” said Mr Kevin Tan, talent acquisition and branding manager of Jason Marine Group. “The more employees know, the more they can do to make their lives better and contribute to the organisation. We believe that our employees are worth the investment.”\nA BOOST IN PRODUCTIVITY\nMr Koek was a marine radio officer sailing with cargo ships for nine years before he came ashore for good and joined Jason Marine Group as a sales coordinator for the China market in 1996.\nOver the years, he has been promoted multiple times. In his current role, he advises the company’s clients on technical product issues. Throughout the many changes in his career, Mr Koek has always enjoyed attending training sessions to learn new skills. “I cherish the opportunities to continuously improve my knowledge base and keep abreast of updated technologies,” he said.\nGaining familiarity with cloud-based platforms and learning technology skills such as coding have enabled him to boost his productivity at work, benefiting both the company and his career.\nOne of the most fruitful courses he attended was UiPath training at NTUC LearningHub in October 2020. UiPath is a software platform that uses cloud computing to automate business processes. Mr Koek learnt to use UiPath to automate the extraction of information from a dynamic database in order to generate updated business reports.\n“UiPath enables us to work more efficiently by using automated processes to take care of repetitive tasks,” explained Mr Koek. “This frees up time for us to focus on other value-added tasks and helps to reduce errors when generating reports. It’s a win-win situation for us all.”\nTAKING OWNERSHIP OF LEARNING\nThe three-week UiPath course meant that Mr Koek had to schedule urgent work matters around his learning hours, but his colleagues were ready to help cover his daily tasks during the training period.\nThe supportive environment at Jason Marine Group has helped to strengthen team cohesion and staff bonding. The organisation also welcomes input from employees on company-related activities and policies, like learning and development. Mr Tan added that employees’ ownership of the learning process enables them to contextualise lessons according to business needs and improves learning takeaways.  \n“With ample opportunities to learn, employees get a platform to showcase their talent at Jason Marine Group,” he said. “New job candidates know that there are growth opportunities, and this also leads to increased employee engagement and retention.”\nSince his UiPath training, Mr Koek shared that he has become more adaptable and agile when it comes to navigating other automation platforms and tools. He has also developed a curious mindset and a more systematic approach to problem-solving.\nFor example, he built on the foundation of his learning by acquiring a deeper understanding of Python to further automate tasks at work. He was inspired to pick up the programming language on his own after his UiPath training, and soon put his newfound coding skills to good use.\n“I used Python to create an automation process for our satellite subscriptions section,” he recounted. “The process extracts satellite air-time data and reports to clients when a predefined usage threshold is reached. Not only were we able to reduce the time required to generate the reports, we also saw an increase in the accuracy of the reports.”\nSUPPORTING BUSINESS OBJECTIVES WITH CUSTOMISED LEARNING\nJason Marine Group is looking to collaborate further with NTUC LearningHub to develop customised courses aimed at equipping employees with transferrable skills needed to succeed in a digitalised and sustainability-driven work environment.\nAs reference, Mr Tan cited the 16 competencies of the new Critical Core Skills developed by SkillsFuture Singapore. These competencies fall into three skill clusters: Thinking critically, interacting with others and staying relevant. Acquiring these skills will be useful in transitioning successfully into new roles across sectors.\nStaying relevant is especially familiar to Mr Koek, who said that the UiPath course has enabled him to learn with agility and increase productivity at work.\n“I am looking forward to picking up new skills in domains like artificial intelligence and robotics,” said Mr Koek. “I hope what I have learned will enable me to do research and development for the company or solve some of the technical challenges we face.”\nAs part of continuing growth, Jason Marine Group plans to have a suite of programmes with NTUC LearningHub that is aligned with the company’s strategies on service delivery.\nTo get employees on board with a continuous learning culture in the workplace, Mr Tan advised: “Besides communicating the benefits of training, the management team must also help in employees’ learning journey by recognising their enhanced competencies in the appraisal process. This will ensure that employees embrace the learning and career development opportunities provided.”\nLearn more about how to develop your company’s talent with NTUC LearningHub."

            "Article Summary": "NO SUMMARY",
            "Article Body": "Formerly known as the National Science Challenge, the National STEM Championship showcases the power of research, innovation and collaboration in everyday life.\nOne of the most exciting events in every science-oriented secondary student’s calendar, the competition that was formerly known as the National Science Challenge has morphed into the National STEM Championship (NSC).\nThe evolution of the annual student competition – organised by Science Centre Singapore –aligns it better with Singapore’s research, innovation and enterprise landscape. Besides science, the NSC now includes technology, engineering and mathematics topics, giving the audience and participants an opportunity to learn more about emerging technologies and STEM applications.\nDr Lee Song Choon, director KidsSTOP, Events & Engagements and Schools & Professional Development at Science Centre Singapore, explained that the competition has shifted from being centred on knowledge and rote memory work to incorporating technical and hands-on applications of STEM.\n“We have also placed greater emphasis on elements such as teamwork, co-operation, resilience as well as science communication, all of which are essential skillsets for the STEM industry,” he added. \nThrough a series of hands-on challenges, teams were tasked to discover the scientific secrets of everyday objects and uncover how scientific innovations have changed lives.\n“Participants now need to design and create structures. Previously, most of the work was theoretical,” explained judge Dr Massimiliano Colla, a senior lecturer at the Singapore University of Technology and Design. “The teams fared very well – they learned that problems can occur at a moment’s notice and may require innovation, creativity and ingenuity to be resolved.”\nThis year’s grand winner was the Raffles Institution (RI) team, with the first runner-up position going to NUS High School of Math & Science (NUS High). Raffles Girls’ School (RGS) was the second runner-up, while CHIJ St Nicholas Girls’ School (SNGS) took third runner-up.\nCOVERING FRESH GROUND\nThe broader scope of the NSC made for more uncertainty going into the competition, according to RI’s Francis Loh, 15. “But this made it all the more exciting, too,” he said.\n“STEM provided so many more interesting elements and varieties of challenges, which made the competition much more fun,” agreed Kristen Yee, 15, from SNGS.\nBesides studying up on STEM topics, all the teams made an effort to prepare for the different elements of the NSC. According to 15-year-old Glenda Lim of RGS, her team’s prior experience with hands-on experimentation and prototype-making provided them with a better foundation in the scientific process.\nStill, there were some nervous moments as teams grappled to deal with the unexpected. RI’s Teo Kai Wen, 14, recounted how his team’s air-powered projectile only flew a few  centimetres during the qualifying round: “It was shocking and disappointing as the projectile flew much further during testing.”\nOng Rui Ting, 15, from SNGS, found the qualifying challenge tough, due to the limited time and materials supplied: “It stretched us a lot in terms of our design and creativity.”\nJudge Rosa So Qi Yue, head of the Healthcare and Medtech Division at the Institute for Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), acknowledged that “it was a steep learning curve” for some teams, especially during the Onsite Challenge – a key component of the NSC that saw teams visit STEM organisations.\nAN INTERDISCIPLINARY SHOWCASE\nThe challenges in the NSC all required an interdisciplinary approach, according to judge Hortense Le Ferrand of Nanyang Technological University: “For example, the bridge challenge incorporated physics, materials science and design.”\n“The NSC’s interdisciplinary nature and hands-on elements made the competition much more unpredictable and challenging, but also really fun,” said Jisoo Kim, 15, of RGS.\nAgreed Yvonne Aurelia Wibowo, 15, of SNGS: “The most interesting moment was the quarter finals, as we experienced the widest variety of challenges such as building a bridge and learning about genetic diseases.”\nIn one of the semi-finals, teams participated in an onsite challenge at Rolls-Royce, where they were asked to programme and design an autonomous car prototype that could manoeuvre around a racetrack.\n“This required coding and engineering knowledge, like knowing where to place the sensors. It resembled real-life interdisciplinary applications,” explained judge Dr Ang Shi Jun, a scientist at the Institute of High Performance Computing, A*STAR.\n“I felt the engineering challenge in the semi-finals was the toughest, but I’m so glad we managed to push through,” said David Chik, 16, from NUS High. “The feeling was absolutely phenomenal.”\nWhile the teams worked hard, they had time to marvel at cutting-edge innovations. The tour of the Advanced Remanufacturing and Technology Centre – a venue where teams had to work on an automated vaccine dosage system – fascinated Solomon Lim, 15, from NUS High, who called it “the most fun moment of the championship”.\nTeams also needed to collaborate and communicate well to complete challenges and convey information to the audience. The celebrity presentation segment of the grand finals was a test of teams’ ability to create a presentation with the provided materials.\nSaid judge Ooi Yau Yen, Engineering (Innovation) chief at the Advanced Remanufacturing and Technology Centre: “I liked the way the solutions were presented in the form of a storyline, because it humanised the solution in a way that’s easy for the layman to understand.”\nSTEM FOR THE FUTURE\nThe NSC experience has given participants a new perspective on STEM. Said Eyu Kai Xing, 15, of SNGS: “ I now truly understand the capability of STEM. I’m most excited about emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and genetic engineering.”\n“The competition has allowed me to better appreciate the beauty of STEM, and made me more passionate about it,” agreed NUS High’s Chua Ke Rui, 15.\nHer teammate Zhu Yancun, 16, appreciated the chance to bond with other contestants. “One thing I am very grateful for is the networking with like-minded youths in Singapore.”\nSimilarly, RGS’ Abhineshwari Narayanan, 15, enjoyed meeting new people. “Every moment was a new experience for me, and every moment of the championship was fun as we broadened our horizons.”\nOthers were inspired by their NSC experience to aim for careers in STEM. “I hope I’ll be able to use my knowledge of STEM to really embrace the interdisciplinary, interconnected future,” said Jared Xu, 15, of RI. “Hopefully, I’ll be able to make the world a better place with new innovations or findings.”\nCatch the National STEM Championship 2022 on meWATCH."
